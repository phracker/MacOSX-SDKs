/*!
    @abstract An interaction that allows using Scribble to enter text by handwriting on a view that is not formally a text input. Use UIIndirectScribbleInteraction if your app has a view that looks to the user as a text input but does not implement UITextInput. It makes the view act as a container of one or more virtual "Text Input Elements", each of which defines an area the user can write into without having to tap first.
    Some examples of when UIIndirectScribbleInteraction can be used:
      - A view that looks like a search field or a text field that in reality is a button, but installs a real text field when tapped
      - A view that contains multiple virtual text fields which the user can normally tap and type into, but are not full blown text fields all the time

/*
 * Defines a delegate to handle text paste handling through item providers.
 * UIKit will handle the state management for pasting several long during item providers
 * if necessary. While the pasting is ongoing, the state of the text control will not
 * be altered, and only at the end the resulting string will be pasted at the specified location.
 *
 * The location of the paste is referenced from the time the paste was initiated. If the
 * text changes in the mean time, this might not be at the same location as before.
 * If the old location is out of bounds of the new text, it will be clamped to the range of the
 * current state of the text when the paste actually occurs.
 *
 * The ranges passed to the 2 optional methods will reflect the actual correct range at the
 * time of actually pasting the resulting string.
 *
 * UITextView and UITextField do not have an explicit .pasteConfiguration set, but will
 * behave like they have one set implicitly depending on a few factors:
 *
 *  - if the view allows editing text attributes (.allowsEditingTextAttributes == YES),
 *    it accepts items that can be read as:
 *      - plain strings
 *      - attributed strings
 *      - images (but only for UITextView)
 *  - if the view does not allow editing text attributes (.allowsEditingTextAttributes == NO),
 *    it accepts items that can be read as:
 *      - plain strings
 *
 * If you modify your text control's pasteConfiguration, you should probably also use
 * this delegate to properly handle any custom items you have there.

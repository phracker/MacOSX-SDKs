NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

/*!
    @abstract An interaction that allows customizing the behavior of Scribble on text input views, or suppress it entirely in specific cases.
    By default, Scribble allows the user to enter text by handwriting directly into any view that implements UITextInput and is editable. In apps with customized text fields, you can use UIScribbleInteraction's delegate callbacks to optimize the UI for a better writing experience. For example, you might want to hide custom placeholders when writing begins, or request delaying focusing the field if it moves when gaining focus.
    In some cases it is necessary to suppress Scribble, for example if a text view also supports drawing with Apple Pencil. You may also need to suppress Scribble in views that handle Pencil events directly, like a drawing canvas, since nearby text fields could take over the Pencil events for writing.

    @abstract Allows the delegate to prevent Scribble from starting at a specific location in the view. If not implemented, defaults to YES.
    You can use this callback to temporarily suppress Scribble in text input views if your app supports drawing over text or other special interaction when using Apple Pencil. In cases like this, it's recommended to provide a UI affordance for the user to toggle between drawing and handwriting.
    This callback can also return NO for views that handle Pencil events directly, like a drawing canvas, since nearby text fields could take over the Pencil events for writing.

    @abstract Allow the delegate to delay focusing (making first responder) the text input view. Normally, Scribble will focus the target input as soon as the user begins writing, but if you return YES from this callback, it will wait until the user makes a brief pause. This is useful in cases where the text input view will shift or transform when becoming first responder, which can be disruptive to a user trying to handwrite into it.
    Wherever possible it is preferable to adjust the UI behavior to avoid the layout changes, and only use delayed focus as a last resort, since transcription will happen all at once instead of incrementally.

 				Once any potential routing is complete, the completion handler is called with the selected route type and with a BOOL indicating whether playback should begin or not.
 	@abstract	A call to this method is an indication that playback is about to start. This gives the receiver an opportunity to prompt the user to pick an output destination if necessary.
 				The receiver will only prompt if the audio session has been configured with a long-form video route sharing policy. 
 	@discussion	Presenting playback UI (e.g. AVPlayerViewController) and commencing playback should be performed in the completionHandler.

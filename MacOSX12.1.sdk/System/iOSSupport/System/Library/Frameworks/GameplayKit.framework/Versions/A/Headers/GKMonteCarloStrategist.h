/**
 * The Monte Carlo Strategist is a generic AI that selects a game model update for a given player that results
 * in the highest likelihood for that player to eventually win the game. It does this by sampling the updates available
 * to the player in question. In doing this it will select the update it knows to produce the best result so far, expanding on this
 * selection, simulating the rest of the game from that expansion, and then propogating the results (win or loss) upwards.
 * It will do this until the budget has been reached, then returning the choice it has deemed best suited for the player in question.

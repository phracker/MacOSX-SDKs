/**
 * A GKNoiseSource instance is a description of procedural noise in 3D space.  Noise sources generate values
 * between -1.0 and 1.0, inclusive, for any position in continuous 3D space.
 * Subclasses represent specific types of noise, each with their own parameters that affect the nature of the noise.
 * Noise sources are the starting point for generating and using procedural noise.  The 3D noise values may be manipulated and
 * combined with the GKNoise class.  Portions of this 3D noise can be extracted and utilized via the GKNoiseMap class.
 * Extracted portions of noise are useful in both 2D and 3D games.  Applications include creating realistic textures,
 * height maps for 2D and 3D game world terrain, tile maps for 2D games, and intentionally imperfect game object and
 * camera movements in 2D and 3D games.
 * This class is not intended to be instantiated.

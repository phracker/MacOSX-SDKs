For example, if the maximum refresh rate of the screen is 60 frames per second, that is also the highest frame rate the view sets as the actual frame rate. However, if you ask for a lower frame rate, it might choose 30, 20, 15 or some other factor to be the actual frame rate. Your application should choose a frame rate that it can consistently maintain. The default value is 60 frames per second.

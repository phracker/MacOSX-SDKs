    VZNetworkDevice should not be instantiated directly.

    Network devices are first configured on the VZVirtualMachineConfiguration through a subclass of VZNetworkDeviceConfiguration.
    When a VZVirtualMachine is created from the configuration, the network devices are available through the VZVirtualMachine.networkDevices property.

 @see VZNetworkDeviceConfiguration

    Setting this property will result in an attempt to change the network device attachment which may fail, in which case
    the -[VZVirtualMachineDelegate virtualMachine:networkDevice:attachmentWasDisconnectedWithError:] will be invoked and this property
    will be set to nil.

    This property may change at any time while the VM is running based on the state of the host network.

                    class will handle connecting to the Bluetooth Daemon for the purposes of searches, and displaying

	@result

/*!
    @method		runModal
	@abstract	Runs the device selector panel in a modal session to allow the user to select a Bluetooth device.
	@discussion	The controller will use the panel attributes to filter what devices the user sees.  The allowed UUIDs
				will be used to validate the selection the user makes.  Only when a selection has been validated (or
				the panel cancelled), will this method return.

				NOTE: This method is only available in Mac OS X 10.2.4 (Bluetooth v1.1) or later.
	@result		Returns kIOBluetoothUISuccess if a successful, validated device selection was made by the user.
				Returns kIOBluetoothUIUserCanceledErr if the user cancelled the panel.  These return values are the
				same as NSRunStoppedResponse and NSRunAbortedResponse respectively.  They are the standard values
				used in a modal session.

    @method		beginSheetModalForWindow:modalDelegate:didEndSelector:contextInfo:
	@abstract	Runs the device selector panel as a sheet on the target window.
	@discussion	This function works the same way as -[NSApplication beginSheet:modalForWindow:modalDelegate:didEndSelector:contextInfo:].
				The didEndSelector has a similar prototype as in NSApplication except that the first argument is the 
				IOBluetoothDeviceSelectorController object instead of the window: 
				-(void)sheetDidEnd:(IOBluetoothDeviceSelectorController *)controller returnCode:(int)returnCode contextInfo:(void *)contextInfo.
				The returnCode parameter will either be kIOBluetoothUISuccess or kIOBluetoothUIUserCancelledErr as described in
				-runModal.

				NOTE: This method is only available in Mac OS X 10.2.4 (Bluetooth v1.1) or later.
	@param		sheetWindow		NSWindow to attach the device selector panel to as a sheet.
	@param		modalDelegate	Delegate object that gets sent the didEndSelector when the sheet modal session is finished.
	@param		didEndSelector	Selector sent to the modalDelegate when the sheet modal session is finished.
	@param		contextInfo		User-definied value passed to the modalDelegate in the didEndSelector.
	@result		Returns kIOReturnSuccess if the sheet modal session was started.

				selection has been validated.  If kIOBluetoothUISuccess was returned for the session, there should be valid 
				results.  Currently only a single device is allowed to be selected, so the results array will only contain 
				one object.  However in the future multiple selection will be supported.

				NOTE: This method is only available in Mac OS X 10.2.4 (Bluetooth v1.1) or later.

				In the future more options will be added to control things like whether the connection to
				the device is closed when the controller is finished or if multiple selection is allowed.

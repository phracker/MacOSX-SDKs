 * @brief Encode an acceleration structure build into the command buffer. All bottom-level acceleration
 * structure builds must have completed before a top-level acceleration structure build may begin. The
 * resulting acceleration structure will not retain any references to the input vertex buffer, instance buffer, etc.
 *
 * The acceleration structure build will not be completed until the command buffer has been committed
 * and finished executing. However, it is safe to encode ray tracing work against the acceleration
 * structure as long as the command buffers are scheduled and synchronized such that the command buffer
 * will have completed by the time the ray tracing starts.
 *
 * The acceleration structure and scratch buffer must be at least the size returned by the
 * [MTLDevice accelerationStructureSizesWithDescriptor:] query.
 *
 * @param accelerationStructure Acceleration structure storage to build into
 * @param descriptor            Object describing the acceleration structure to build
 * @param scratchBuffer         Scratch buffer to use while building the acceleration structure. The
 *                              contents may be overwritten and are undefined after the build has
 *                              started/completed.

 * @brief Encode an acceleration structure refit into the command buffer. Refitting can be used to
 * update the acceleration structure when geometry changes and is much faster than rebuilding from
 * scratch. However, the quality of the acceleration structure and the subsequent ray tracing
 * performance will degrade depending on how much the geometry changes.
 * 
 * Refitting can not be used after certain changes, such as adding or removing geometry. Acceleration
 * structures can be refit in place by specifying the same source and destination acceleration structures
 * or by providing a nil destination acceleration structure. If the source and destination acceleration
 * structures are not the same, they must not overlap in memory.
 *
 * The destination acceleration structure must be at least as large as the source acceleration structure,
 * unless the source acceleration structure has been compacted, in which case the destination acceleration
 * structure must be at least as large as the compacted size of the source acceleration structure.

/*-
 * AE Mach API --
 *
 * AppleEvents on OS X are implemented in terms of mach messages.
 * To facilitate writing server processes that can send and receive
 * AppleEvents, the following APIs are provided.
 *
 * AppleEvents are directed to a well known port uniquely tied to a
 * process.  The AE framework will discover this port based on the
 * keyAddressAttr of the event (as specifed in AECreateAppleEvent by
 * the target parameter.)  If a port cannot be found,
 * procNotFound (-600) will be returned on AESend.
 *
 * Of note is a new attribute for an AppleEvent, keyReplyPortAttr.
 * This specifies the mach_port_t to which an AppleEvent reply
 * should be directed.  By default, replies are sent to the
 * processes' registered port where they are culled from the normal  
 * event stream if there is an outstanding AESend + kAEWaitReply.
 * But it may be desirable for a client to specify their own port to
 * receive queud replies.
 *
 * In the case of AESendMessage with kAEWaitReply specified, an 
 * anonymous port will be used to block until the reply is received.
 *
 * Not supplied is a convenience routine to block a server and
 * process AppleEvents.  This implementation will be detailed in a
 * tech note.
 *
 * In general, the AppleEvent APIs are thread safe, but the mechanism
 * of their delivery (AEProcessAppleEvent, AEResumeTheCurrentEvent)
 * are not.  If you're attemping to write a thread safe server, you
 * should avoid AppleEvent routines that don't explicitly state their
 * thread safety.

 *    framework for this process.  This port is considered public, and
 *    will be used by other applications to target your process.  You
 *    are free to use this mach_port_t to add to a port set, if and
 *    only if, you are not also using routines from HIToolbox.  In that

/*
 *  AEDecodeMessage()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Decode a mach_msg into an AppleEvent and its related reply.  (The
 *    reply is set up from fields of the event.)  You can call this
 *    routine if you wish to dispatch or handle the event yourself.  To
 *    return a reply to the sender, you should call:
 *     AESendMessage(reply, NULL, kAENoReply, kAENormalPriority,
 *    kAEDefaultTimeout);
 *    If this message is a reply, the 'reply' parameter will be
 *    initialized to { typeNull, 0 }, and the 'event' parameter will be
 *    the AppleEvent reply with a event class attribute of
 *    typeAppleEvent, class typeAppleEventReply:
 *    The contents of the header are invalid after this call.
 *

    Common folder locations:
    ========================
    kSystemDomain is generally /System and things inside it, so
     - kSystemDomain, kDomainLibraryFolderType is /System/Library/
     - kSystemDomain, kTrashFolderType is a trash folder on the same volume as /System ( the boot disk )
     - kSystemDomain, kDomainTopLevelFolderType is the root of the system domain, so it's the same as /System
    kLocalDomain is generally the admin-writeable, system-wide location for things, so
     - kLocalDomain, kDomainLibraryFolderType is /Library/
    kUserDomain maps to the current user's home folder, so that
     - kUserDomain, kCurrentUserFolderType is the user's home folder itself ( "$HOME", ~ )
     - kUserDomain, kDomainLibraryFolderType is the Library folder in the user home ( "$HOME/Library", "~/Library/" )
     - kUserDomain, kPreferencesFolderType is the Preferences folder in the user home ( "$HOME/Library/Preferences/" )
     - kUserDomain, kTrashFolderType is a trash folder on the same volume as the user home
    kNetworkDomain, if configured, is a network file system which a network administrator may have installed items into
     - kNetworkDomain, kApplicationsFolderType is /Network/Applications/
    kClassicDomain, if configured, is where the Mac OS X Classic environment information is stored
     - kClassicDomain, kSystemFolderType is the currently active Macintosh Classic system folder ( or fnfErr if a Classic isn't installed )

/*
 *  FindFolder()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains location information for system-related directories.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    For the folder type on the particular volume (specified,
 *    respectively, in the folderType and vRefNum parameters), the
 *    FindFolder function returns the directory's volume reference
 *    number in the foundVRefNum parameter and its directory ID in the
 *    foundDirID parameter.
 *    
 *    The specified folder used for a given volume might be located on
 *    a different volume in future versions of system software;
 *    therefore, do not assume the volume that you specify in vRefNum
 *    and the volume returned in foundVRefNum will be the same.
 *     
 *    Specify a volume reference number (or the constant kOnSystemDisk
 *    for the startup disk) or one of the domain constants ( on Mac OS
 *    X ) in the vRefNum parameter.
 *    
 *    Specify a four-character folder type--or the constant that
 *    represents it--in the folderType parameter.
 *    
 *    Use the constant kCreateFolder in the createFolder parameter to
 *    tell FindFolder to create a directory if it does not already
 *    exist; otherwise, use the constant kDontCreateFolder. Directories
 *    inside the System Folder are created only if the System Folder
 *    directory exists. The FindFolder function will not create a
 *    System Folder directory even if you specify the kCreateFolder
 *    constant in the createFolder parameter.
 *    
 *    The FindFolder function returns a nonzero result code if the
 *    folder isn't found, and it can also return other file system
 *    errors reported by the File Manager or Memory Manager.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe since version 10.3
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    vRefNum:
 *      Pass the volume reference number of the volume on which you
 *      want to locate a directory, or a constant specifying a disk or
 *      domain.   The constants which you can use in this parameter are
 *      described in "Disk and Domain Constants".
 *      Note that, on Mac OS X, passing a volume reference number in
 *      this parameter does not make sense for most of the folder type
 *      selectors which you can specify in the folderType parameter. On
 *      Mac OS X, folders are "domain-oriented"; because there may be
 *      more than one domain on any given physical volume, asking for
 *      these folders on a per-volume basis yields undefined results.
 *      For example, if you were to request the Fonts folder
 *      (represented by the selector kFontsFolderType ) on volume -100,
 *      are you requesting the folder /System/Library/Fonts,
 *      /Library/Fonts, or ~/Fonts? On Mac OS X you should pass a disk
 *      or domain constant in this parameter.
 *    
 *    folderType:
 *      A four-character folder type, or a constant that represents the
 *      type, for the directory you want to find.
 *    
 *    createFolder:
 *      Pass the constant kCreateFolder in this parameter to create a
 *      directory if it does not already exist; otherwise, pass the
 *      constant kDontCreateFolder.
 *    
 *    foundVRefNum:
 *      The volume reference number, returned by FindFolder , for the
 *      volume containing the directory you specify in the folderType
 *      parameter.
 *    
 *    foundDirID:
 *      The directory ID number, returned by FindFolder , for the
 *      directory you specify in the folderType parameter.
 *  
 *  Availability:
 *    Mac OS X:         in version 10.0 and later in CoreServices.framework

/*
 *  AddFolderDescriptor()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Copies the supplied information into a new folder descriptor
 *    entry in the system folder list. @discussion The
 *    AddFolderDescriptor function copies the supplied information into
 *    a new descriptor entry in the system folder list. You need to
 *    provide folder descriptors for each folder you wish the Folder
 *    Manager to be able to find via the function FindFolder. For
 *    example, a child folder located in a parent folder needs to have
 *    a descriptor created both for it and its parent folder, so that
 *    the child can be found. This function is supported under Mac OS 8
 *    and later. 
 *    On Mac OS X, folder descriptors added in one process are not
 *    visible in other processes.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe since version 10.3
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    foldType:
 *      Pass a constant identifying the type of the folder you wish the
 *      Folder Manager to be able to find. See ÒFolder Type ConstantsÓ.
 *    
 *    flags:
 *      Set these flags to indicate whether a folder is created during
 *      startup, if the folder name is locked, and if the folder is
 *      created invisible; see ÒFolder Descriptor FlagsÓ.
 *    
 *    foldClass:
 *      Pass the class of the folder which you wish the Folder Manager
 *      to be able to find. The folder class determines how the
 *      foldLocation parameter is interpreted. See "Folder Descriptor
 *      Classes" for a discussion of relative and special folder
 *      classes.
 *    
 *    foldLocation:
 *      For a relative folder, specify the folder type of the parent
 *      folder of the target. For a special folder, specify the
 *      location of the folder; see ÒFolder Descriptor LocationsÓ.
 *    
 *    badgeSignature:
 *      Reserved. Pass 0.
 *    
 *    badgeType:
 *      Reserved. Pass 0.
 *    
 *    name:
 *      A string specifying the name of the desired folder. For
 *      relative folders, this is the exact name of the desired folder.
 *      For special folders, the actual target folder may have a
 *      different name than the name specified in the folder
 *      descriptor. For example, the System Folder is often given a
 *      different name, but it can still be located with FindFolder.
 *    
 *    replaceFlag:
 *      Pass a Boolean value indicating whether you wish to replace a
 *      folder descriptor that already exists for the specified folder
 *      type. If true , it replaces the folder descriptor for the
 *      specified folder type. If false , it does not replace the

 *  Discussion:
 *    For the folder type on the particular volume (specified,

 *    
 *    The specified folder used for a given volume might be located on
 *    a different volume in future versions of system software;
 *    therefore, do not assume the volume that you specify in vRefNum
 *    and the volume returned in foundVRefNum will be the same.
 *     
 *    Specify a volume reference number (or the constant kOnSystemDisk

 *    
 *    Specify a four-character folder type--or the constant that
 *    represents it--in the folderType parameter.
 *    
 *    Use the constant kCreateFolder in the createFolder parameter to
 *    tell FindFolder to create a directory if it does not already

 *    The FindFolder function returns a nonzero result code if the

 *    totalRoutingCount:
 *      A pointer to an unsigned 32-bit value. On return, the value is
 *      set to the number of folder routing structures in the global
 *      list. If this value is less than or equal to
 *      requestedRoutingCount , all folder routing structures were
 *      returned to the caller.
 *    
 *    routingSize:
 *      Pass the size (in bytes) of the FolderRouting structure.

/*
 *  FSpDetermineIfSpecIsEnclosedByFolder()   *** DEPRECATED ***

 *  Deprecated:
 *    Use FSDetemineIfRefIsEnclosedByFolder
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Determine whether the given FSSpec is enclosed inside the given
 *    special folder type for the given domain.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This is a fairly fast call which can determine whether a given
 *    FSSpec on disk is 'inside' the given special folder type for the
 *    given domain.  This call will be more efficient than the
 *    equivalent client code which walked up the file list, checking
 *    each parent with IdentifyFolder() to see if it matches. One use
 *    for this call is to determine if a given file or folder is inside
 *    the trash on a volume, with something like
 *    
 *    err = FSpDetermineIfRefIsEnclosedByFolder( kOnAppropriateDisk,
 *    kTrashFolderType, & spec, & result );
 *    if ( err == noErr && result ) {
 *    //  FSSpec is inside trash on the volume.<br> }
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe since version 10.4
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    domainOrVRefNum:
 *      The domain or vRefNum to check.  You can also pass
 *      kOnAppropriateDisk to check whatever vRefNum is appropriate for
 *      the given FSSpec, or the value 0 to check all vRefNums and
 *      domains.
 *    
 *    folderType:
 *      The folder type to check
 *    
 *    inSpec:
 *      The FSSpec to look for.
 *    
 *    outResult:
 *      If non-NULL, this will be filled in with true if the given
 *      FSSpec is enclosed inside the special folder type for the given
 *      domain, or false otherwise.

  These calls subsume the functionality of using the PPCToolbox on Mac
  OS 9 to locate processes on remote computers.  (PPCToolbox is not
  part of Carbon.)  These calls are supported on Mac OS X 10.3 or
  later.
  
  The model is to create a resolver for a particular URL and schedule
  it on a CFRunLoop to retrieve the results asynchronously.  If
  synchronous behavior is desired, just call
  AERemoteProcessResolverGetProcesses to get the array; the call will
  block until the request is completed.
  
  A resolver can only be used once; once it has fetched the data or
  gotten an error it can no longer be scheduled.
  
  The data obtained from the resolver is a CFArrayRef of
  CFDictionaryRef objects.  Each dictionary contains the URL of the
  remote application and its human readable name.

/**
 Determines whether the current application is able to send an AppleEvent with the given eventClass and eventID to the application described as targetAddressDesc.

 Mac OS 10.14 and later impose additional requirements on applications when they send AppleEvents to other applications in order
 to insure that users are aware of and consent to allowing such control or information exchange.  Generally this involves
 the user being prompted in a secure fashion the first time an application attempts to send an AppleEvent to another application.
 If the user consents then this application can send events to the target.  If the user does not consent then any future
 attempts to send AppleEvents will result in a failure with errAEEventNotPermitted being returned.

 Certain AppleEvents are allowed to be sent without prompting the user.  Pass typeWildCard for the eventClass and eventID
 to determine if every event is allowed to be sent from this application to the target.

 Applications can determine, without sending an AppleEvent to a target application, whether they are allowed to send AppleEvents
 to the target with this function.  If askUserIfNeeded is true, and this application does not yet have permission to send
 AppleEvents to the target, then the user will be asked if permission can be granted; if askUserIfNeeded is false and permission
 has not been granted, then errAEEventWouldRequireUserConsent will be returned.

 The target AEAddressDesc must refer to an already running application.

 @subsection macOS Threading
 Thread safe since version 10.14.  Do not call this function on your main thread because it may take arbitrarily long
 to return if the user needs to be prompted for consent.

 @param target
    A pointer to an address descriptor. Before calling AEDeterminePermissionToAutomateTarget, you set the descriptor to identify
    the target application for the Apple event.  The target address descriptor must refer to a running application.  If
    the target application is on another machine, then Remote AppleEvents must be enabled on that machine for the user.

 @param theAEEventClass
    The event class of the Apple event to determine permission for.

 @param theAEEventID
    The event ID of the Apple event to determine permission for.

 @param askUserIfNeeded
    a Boolean; if true, and if this application does not yet have permission to send events to the target application, then
	prompt the user to obtain permission.  If false, do not prompt the user.

 @returns If the current application is permitted to send the given AppleEvent to the target, then noErr will be returned.  If the
 current application is not permitted to send the event, errAEEventNotPermitted will be returned.  If the target application
 is not running, then procNotFound will be returned.  If askUserIfNeeded is false, and this application is not yet permitted
 to send AppleEvents to the target, then errAEEventWouldRequireUserConsent will be returned.

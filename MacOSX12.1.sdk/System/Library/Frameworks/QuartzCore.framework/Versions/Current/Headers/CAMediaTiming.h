/* The CAMediaTiming protocol is implemented by layers and animations, it
 * models a hierarchical timing system, with each object describing the
 * mapping from time values in the object's parent to local time.
 *
 * Absolute time is defined as mach time converted to seconds. The
 * CACurrentMediaTime function is provided as a convenience for querying the
 * current absolute time.
 *
 * The conversion from parent time to local time has two stages:
 *
 * 1. conversion to "active local time". This includes the point at
 * which the object appears in the parent's timeline, and how fast it
 * plays relative to the parent.
 *
 * 2. conversion from active to "basic local time". The timing model
 * allows for objects to repeat their basic duration multiple times,
 * and optionally to play backwards before repeating. */

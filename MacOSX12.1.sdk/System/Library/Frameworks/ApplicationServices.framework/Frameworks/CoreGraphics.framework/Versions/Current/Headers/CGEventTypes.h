/* An opaque type that represents a low-level hardware event.

   Low-level hardware events of this type are referred to as Quartz events.
   A typical event in Mac OS X originates when the user manipulates an input
   device such as a mouse or a keyboard. The device driver associated with
   that device, through the I/O Kit, creates a low-level event, puts it in
   the window serverâ€™s event queue, and notifies the window server. The
   window server creates a Quartz event, annotates the event, and dispatches
   the event to the appropriate run-loop port of the target process. There
   the event is picked up by the Carbon Event Manager and forwarded to the
   event-handling mechanism appropriate to the application environment. You
   can use event taps to gain access to Quartz events at several different
   steps in this process.

   This opaque type is derived from `CFType' and inherits the properties
   that all Core Foundation types have in common. */

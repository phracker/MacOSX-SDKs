 *  [Mac]GetCurrentProcess()
 *  
 *  DEPRECATED

 *
 *  Discussion:
 *    Return the canonical process serial number to the caller.
 *    
 *    All applications ( things which can appear in the Dock or which
 *    are not documents and are launched by the Finder or Dock ) on Mac
 *    OS 10 have a unique process serial number. This number is created
 *    when the application launches, and remains until the application
 *    quits. Other system services, like AppleEvents, use the
 *    ProcessSerialNumber to specify an application.
 *    
 *    During launch, every application 'checks in' with the Process
 *    Manager. Before this checkin, the application can not receive
 *    events or draw to the screen. Prior to Mac OS 10.2, this 'check
 *    in' happened before the applications's main() function was
 *    entered. In Mac OS 10.2 and later, this 'check in' does not
 *    happen until the first time the application calls a Process
 *    Manager function, or until it enters CFRunLoopRun() for the main
 *    runloop. This allows tools and other executables which do not
 *    need to receive events to link against more of the higher level
 *    toolbox frameworks, but may cause a problem if the application
 *    expects to be able to retrieve events or use CoreGraphics
 *    services before this checkin has occurred.
 *    
 *    An application can force the connection to the Process Manager to
 *    be set up by calling any Process Manager routine, but the
 *    recommended way to do this is to call GetCurrentProcess() to ask
 *    for the current application's PSN. This will initialize the
 *    connection to the Process Manager if it has not already been set
 *    up and 'check in' the application with the system.
 *    
 *    This function is named MacGetCurrentProcess() on non Macintosh
 *    platforms and GetCurrentProcess on the Macintosh. However, even
 *    Macintosh code can use the MacGetCurrentProcess() name since
 *    there is a macro which maps back to GetCurrentProcess().
 *    
 *    Lastly, it is usually not necessary to call GetCurrentProcess()
 *    to get the 'current' process psn merely to pass it to another
 *    Process Manager routine. Instead, just construct a
 *    ProcessSerialNumber with 0 in highLongOfPSN and kCurrentProcess
 *    in lowLongOfPSN and pass that. For example, to make the current
 *    process the frontmost process, use ( C code follows )
 *    
 *    ProcessSerialNumber psn = { 0, kCurrentProcess }; 
 *    
 *    OSErr err = SetFrontProcess( & psn );
 *    
 *    If you need to pass a ProcessSerialNumber to another application
 *    or use it in an AppleEvent, you do need to get the canonical PSN
 *    with this routine.

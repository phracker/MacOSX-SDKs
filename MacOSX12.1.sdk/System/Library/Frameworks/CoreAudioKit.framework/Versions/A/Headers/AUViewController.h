	@discussion
		Hosts may support embedding the view of an audio unit in different configurations. These
		configurations may vary in the size reserved for the audio unit's view and the additional 
		control surfaces that are displayed along with it. The host can propose several view 
		configurations and the audio unit should report the ones which it supports.

		See the documentation for supportedViewConfigurations.

	@discussion
		The host can query the audio unit for all the view configurations it supports.
		Hosts can support multiple configurations in which they can display the user interfaces of
		audio units (for example: full screen, normal, live mode, etc). These configurations can be
		of different sizes and the host might display its own control surfaces along with the view
		of the audio unit. The host will call this method and pass an array of supported
		configurations.

		The audio unit should override this method and implement its own logic to report all the 
		view configurations it supports. The size of the view in the selected configuration should 
		be large enough to fit the view of the audio unit, otherwise it might be truncated and a 
		scroll bar might be necessary to navigate it.

		In case an empty set is returned from this method, it is considered that the plugin only 
		supports the largest available view configuration.

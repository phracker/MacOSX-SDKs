/// @brief The @c SHSignature class is an opaque data container that can be used to store recognition data.
/// @discussion Signatures are a compact lossy representation of the original audio. The original audio cannot
/// be recreated from a Signature, there exists only enough data to confirm that the signature matches a certain piece of audio
/// when it is also converted into a Signature. It is similar in utility to a hashing function.
///
/// Signatures can be matched against any type of audio not just music. The only requirement for a match is that the reference and query
/// Signatures both contain the exact same pre recorded audio e.g. a live rendition of a song will not match against a studio recorded performance
/// of the same piece.
///
/// There are exceptions to the requirement for exactly matching audio, a signature is robust against slight changes in frequency and speed.

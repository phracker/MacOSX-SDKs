/// @discussion A @c SHSession can be used in two distinct ways to match against a @c SHCatalog
///
/// 1. Pass a @c SHSignature to the -[SHSession matchSignature:] method and respond to matches sent to the delegate
///      There is a 1 to 1 relationship between calls to this method and calls to the delegate
/// 2. Pass a continuous stream of @c AVAudioPCMBuffer to the -[SHSession matchStreamingBuffer:atTime:] method, matches are sent to the delegate.
///        ShazamKit will convert the buffers in SHSignature objects internally and perform matches against the @c SHCatalog. The details of how the matching
///        is performed is an implementation detail and is subject to change. As such there will be many callbacks to the delegate per stream of audio, and the same match
///        may be reported multiple times in succession.

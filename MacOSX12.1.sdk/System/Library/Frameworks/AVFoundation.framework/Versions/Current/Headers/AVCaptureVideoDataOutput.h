 @class AVCaptureVideoDataOutput
 @abstract
    AVCaptureVideoDataOutput is a concrete subclass of AVCaptureOutput that can be used to process uncompressed or compressed frames from the video being captured.
 
 @discussion
    Instances of AVCaptureVideoDataOutput produce video frames suitable for processing using other media APIs. Applications can access the frames with the captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: delegate method.

 @method setSampleBufferDelegate:queue:
 @abstract
    Sets the receiver's delegate that will accept captured buffers and dispatch queue on which the delegate will be called.
 
 @param sampleBufferDelegate
    An object conforming to the AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate protocol that will receive sample buffers after they are captured.
 @param sampleBufferCallbackQueue
    A dispatch queue on which all sample buffer delegate methods will be called.
 
 @discussion
    When a new video sample buffer is captured it will be vended to the sample buffer delegate using the captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: delegate method. All delegate methods will be called on the specified dispatch queue. If the queue is blocked when new frames are captured, those frames will be automatically dropped at a time determined by the value of the alwaysDiscardsLateVideoFrames property. This allows clients to process existing frames on the same queue without having to manage the potential memory usage increases that would otherwise occur when that processing is unable to keep up with the rate of incoming frames. If their frame processing is consistently unable to keep up with the rate of incoming frames, clients should consider using the minFrameDuration property, which will generally yield better performance characteristics and more consistent frame rates than frame dropping alone.
 
    Clients that need to minimize the chances of frames being dropped should specify a queue on which a sufficiently small amount of processing is being done outside of receiving sample buffers. However, if such clients migrate extra processing to another queue, they are responsible for ensuring that memory usage does not grow without bound from frames that have not been processed.
 
    A serial dispatch queue must be used to guarantee that video frames will be delivered in order. The sampleBufferCallbackQueue parameter may not be NULL, except when setting the sampleBufferDelegate to nil.

    Note that the dictionary of settings is dependent on the current configuration of the receiver's AVCaptureSession and its inputs.

 @property automaticallyConfiguresOutputBufferDimensions
 @abstract
    Indicates whether the receiver automatically configures the size of output buffers.
 
 @discussion
    Default value is YES. In most configurations, AVCaptureVideoDataOutput delivers full-resolution buffers, that is, buffers with the same dimensions as the source AVCaptureDevice's activeFormat's videoDimensions. When this property is set to YES, the receiver is free to configure the dimensions of the buffers delivered to -captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection:, such that they are a smaller preview size (roughly the size of the screen). For instance, when the AVCaptureSession's sessionPreset is set to AVCaptureSessionPresetPhoto, it is assumed that video data output buffers are being delivered as a preview proxy. Likewise, if an AVCapturePhotoOutput is present in the session with livePhotoCaptureEnabled, it is assumed that video data output is being used for photo preview, and thus preview-sized buffers are a better choice than full-res buffers. You can query deliversPreviewSizedOutputBuffers to find out whether automatic configuration of output buffer dimensions is currently downscaling buffers to a preview size. You can also query the videoSettings property to find out the exact width and height being delivered. If you wish to manually set deliversPreviewSizedOutputBuffers, you must first set automaticallyConfiguresOutputBufferDimensions to NO.

 @discussion
    Delegates receive this message whenever the output captures and outputs a new video frame, decoding or re-encoding it as specified by its videoSettings property. Delegates can use the provided video frame in conjunction with other APIs for further processing. This method will be called on the dispatch queue specified by the output's sampleBufferCallbackQueue property. This method is called periodically, so it must be efficient to prevent capture performance problems, including dropped frames.
 
    Clients that need to reference the CMSampleBuffer object outside of the scope of this method must CFRetain it and then CFRelease it when they are finished with it.
 
    Note that to maintain optimal performance, some sample buffers directly reference pools of memory that may need to be reused by the device system and other capture inputs. This is frequently the case for uncompressed device native capture where memory blocks are copied as little as possible. If multiple sample buffers reference such pools of memory for too long, inputs will no longer be able to copy new samples into memory and those samples will be dropped. If your application is causing samples to be dropped by retaining the provided CMSampleBuffer objects for too long, but it needs access to the sample data for a long period of time, consider copying the data into a new buffer and then calling CFRelease on the sample buffer if it was previously retained so that the memory it references can be reused.

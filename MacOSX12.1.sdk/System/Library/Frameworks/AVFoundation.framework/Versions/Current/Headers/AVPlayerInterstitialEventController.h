  @class        AVPlayerInterstitialEvent

  @abstract
    An AVPlayerInterstitialEvent provides instructions for temporarily suspending the playback of primary content in order to play alternative interstitial content instead, resuming playback of the primary content when playback of the interstitial content is complete or is canceled.
    
  @discussion
    The primary content is specified as an instance of AVPlayerItem, designated as the primary item of the interstitial event.

    The timing of interstitial playback is specified as a date within the date range of the primary item. Interstitial events are currently possible only for items with an intrinsic mapping from their timeline to real-time dates.

    The alternative interstitial content is specified as an array of one or more AVPlayerItems that will be used as templates for the creation of items for interstitial playback. In other words, these template items are not the actual items that will be played during interstitial playback; instead they are used to generate the items that are to be played, with property values that match the configuration of your template items.

    If you wish to observe the scheduling and progress of interstitial events, use an AVPlayerInterstitialEventMonitor. If you wish to specify your own schedule of interstitial events, use an AVPlayerInterstitialEventController.

During this suspension, playback of items that replicate the interstitial template items of the event are played by the interstitial player, which temporarily assumes the output configuration of the primary player; for example, its visual content will be routed to AVPlayerLayers that reference the primary player. Once the interstitial player has advanced through playback of the interstitial items specified by the event or its current item otherwise becomes nil, playback of the primary content will resume, at an offset from the time at which it was suspended as specified by the event.

    Setting this property to a non-nil value cancels and overrides all previously scheduled future interstitial events, including those that are intrinsically specified by the content of primary items, such as directives carried by HLS media playlists. Setting it to nil causes its value to be reset in accordance with the content of the current primary item.

The effective resumption offset will be the sum of the resumption offsets of the coinciding interstitial events. (Note that the sum of a numeric CMTime and kCMTimeIndefinite is kCMTimeIndefinite.)

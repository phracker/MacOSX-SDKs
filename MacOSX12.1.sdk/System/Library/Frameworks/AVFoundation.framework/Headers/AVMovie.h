    @class			AVMovie

    @abstract		AVMovie represents the audiovisual containers in a file that conforms to the QuickTime movie file format or to one of the related ISO base media file formats (such as MPEG-4).

	@discussion     AVMovie supports operations involving the format-specific portions of the QuickTime Movie model that are not supported by AVAsset. For instance, you can retrieve the movie header from an existing QuickTime movie file. You can also use AVMovie to write a movie header into a new file, thereby creating a reference movie.
  
                    A mutable subclass of AVMovie, AVMutableMovie, provides methods that support the familiar Movie editing model; for instance, you can use AVMutableMovie to copy media data from one track and paste that data into another track. You can also use AVMutableMovie to establish track references from one track to another (for example, to set one track as a chapter track of another track). If you want to perform editing operations on individual tracks, you can use the associated classes AVMovieTrack and AVMutableMovieTrack.
 
                    You need to use AVMovie and AVMutableMovie only when operating on format-specific features of a QuickTime or ISO base media file. You generally do not need to use these classes just to open and play QuickTime movie files or ISO base media files. Instead, you can use the classes AVURLAsset and AVPlayerItem. If however you already have an AVMutableMovie and want to play it or inspect it, you can make an immutable snapshot of the AVMutableMovie like this:
 
			 // myMutableMovie is of type AVMutableMovie; the client wants to inspect and play it in its current state
			 AVMovie *immutableSnapshotOfMyMovie = [myMutableMovie copy];
			 AVPlayerItem *playerItemForSnapshotOfMovie = [[AVPlayerItem alloc] initWithAsset:immutableSnapshotOfMyMovie]; 
 
 					When performing media insertions, AVMutableMovie interleaves the media data from the tracks in the source asset in order to create movie files that are optimized for playback. It's possible, however, that performing a series of media insertions may result in a movie file that is not optimally interleaved. You can create a well-interleaved, self-contained, fast-start movie file from an instance of AVMutableMovie by passing that instance to an AVAssetExportSession using the export preset AVAssetExportPresetPassthrough and setting the setShouldOptimizeForNetworkUse property to YES.

  @constant		AVMovieReferenceRestrictionsKey
  @abstract
	Indicates the restrictions used by the movie when resolving references to external media data. The value of this key is an NSNumber wrapping an AVAssetReferenceRestrictions enum value or the logical combination of multiple such values. See AVAsset.h for the declaration of the AVAssetReferenceRestrictions enum.
  @discussion
	Some movies can contain references to media data stored outside the movie's container, for example in another file. This key can be used to specify a policy to use when these references are encountered. If a movie contains one or more references of a type that is forbidden by the reference restrictions, loading of movie properties will fail. In addition, such a movie cannot be used with other AVFoundation modules, such as AVPlayerItem or AVAssetExportSession.

		Default is NO. Although the majority of QuickTime movie files contain all of the media data they require, some contain references to media stored in other files. While AVFoundation and CoreMedia typically employ a URL reference for this purpose, older implementations such as QuickTime 7 have commonly employed a Macintosh alias instead, as documented in the QuickTime File Format specification. If your application must work with legacy QuickTime movie files containing alias-based references to media data stored in other files, the use of this AVMovie initialization option is appropriate. AVMovie and AVMutableMovie do not create movies using alias data references to external media files.
 
	If you provide a value for AVMovieReferenceRestrictionsKey, restrictions will be observed for resolved alias references just as they are for URL references.

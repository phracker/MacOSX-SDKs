	@header		CMIOSampleBuffer.h
	@abstract	API for creating CMSampleBuffers for use by CMIO.
	@discussion	Buffers used by CMIO are CMSampleBuffers that have a required
				set of attachments.<br>
				<br>
				The first required attachment is a sequence number.  Every time a
				buffer is created, a sequence number is attached.  The sequence
				numbers for buffers emitted by an entity must increment monotonically
				by one.  This allows clients of the buffers to easily tell if a
				break has occurred in the stream of buffers that it is receiving
				(such a break might occur if a CMIO Unit in a processing chain
				needs to drop buffers for some reason).<br>
				<br>
				The second required attachment is a UInt32 that consists of a
				bitfield used to indicate a discontinuity in the contents of the
				buffers.  Many types of discontinuities are defined below.<br>
				A client is assured that a given buffer is a valid continuation
				of a media stream if the sequence number is one more than the
				previously experienced sequence number and the discontinity flags
				are all at zero.<br>
				<br>
				A special kind of buffer, called a no-data marker, can be emitted
				by entities that marshall media streams from real-time devices.
				A no-data marker is used to indicate that the device has stopped
				providing buffers;  for example, a tape-based device that has hit
				a blank spot on its media.

	@function	CMIOSampleBufferCreateForImageBuffer
	@abstract	Creates a CMSampleBuffer that can be used in a CMIO Graph, that contains a CVImageBuffer
				instead of a CMBlockBuffer.
	@discussion	This routine is a specialized version of CMIOSampleBufferCreate.
				See the description of that routine for background information.
				
				Unlike a CMBlockBuffer which can reference many samples, a CVImageBuffer is defined to
				reference only one sample;  therefore this routine has fewer parameters then
				CMIOSampleBufferCreate.
				
				Sample timing information, which is a vector for CMIOSampleBufferCreate,
				consists of only one value for this routine.
				
				The concept of sample size does not apply to CVImageBuffers.  As such, CMSampleBufferGetSampleSizeArray
				will return kCMSampleBufferError_BufferHasNoSampleSizes, and CMSampleBufferGetSampleSize
				will return 0.
				
				Because CVImageBuffers hold visual data, the format description provided is a
				CMVideoFormatDescription.  The format description must be consistent with formatting
				information attached to the CVImageBuffer. The width, height, and codecType must match
				(for CVPixelBuffers the codec type is given by CVPixelBufferGetPixelFormatType(pixelBuffer);
				for other CVImageBuffers, the codecType must be 0). The format description extensions must
				match the image buffer attachments for all the keys in the list returned by
				CMVideoFormatDescriptionGetExtensionKeysCommonWithImageBuffers (if absent in either they
				must be absent in both).

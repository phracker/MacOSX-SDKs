    @header CMIOHardwareStream
    A CMIOStream represents a single conduit of data for transferring across the user/kernel boundary. As such, CMIOStreams are the gatekeepers of format information. Each has it's own
    format and list of available formats. These formats are not constrained, and may include encoded formats and non-media formats.

    CMIOStreams can contain instances of the CMIOControl class or it's many subclasses.

#pragma mark CMIOStream Properties

/*!
    @enum           CMIOStream Properties
    @abstract       CMIOObjectPropertySelector values that apply to all CMIOStreams.
    @discussion     CMIOStream is a subclass of CMIOObject and has only the single scope, kCMIOObjectPropertyScopeGlobal. They have a main element and an element for each channel
                    in the stream numbered upward from 1. Note that CMIOStream objects share CMIOControl objects with their owning CMIODevice. Consequently, all the standard
                    CMIOControl related property selectors implemented by CMIODevices are also implemented by CMIOStreams. The same constants are to be used for such properties.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyDirection
                        A UInt32 where a value of 0 means that this CMIOStream is an output stream and a value of 1 means that it is an input stream.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyTerminalType
                        A UInt32 whose value describes the general kind of functionality attached to the CMIOStream. Constants that describe some of the values of this property are defined
                        in <IOKit/audio/IOAudioTypes.h>
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyStartingChannel
                        A UInt32 that specifies the first element in the owning device that corresponds to element one of this stream.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyLatency
                        A UInt32 containing the number of frames of latency in the CMIOStream. Note that the owning CMIODevice may have additional latency so it should be queried as
                        well. If both the device and the stream say they have latency, then the total latency for the stream is the device latency summed with the stream latency.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescription
                        A CMFormatDescriptionRef that describes the current format for the CMIOStream. When getting this property, the client must release the CMFormatDescriptionRef
                        when done with it. If settable, either one of the CMFormatDescriptionRefs obtained by getting the kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescriptions property can be
                        used, or a new CMFormatDescriptionRef can be provided. In the event of the latter, the CMFormatDescriptionEquals() routine will be used to see if the
                        stream can support the provided CMFormatDescriptionRef.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescriptions
                        An CFArray of CMFormatDescriptionRefs that describe the available data formats for the CMIOStream. The client must release the CFArray when done with it.
                        This property is never settable, and is not present for streams whose kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescription property is not settable.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyStillImage
                        A CMSampleBufferRef which holds a still image that is generated as soon as possible when getting this property. The client must release the CMSampleBufferRef when
                        done with it. The qualifier contains the desired CMFormatDescriptionRef of the still. The description can be one of those obtained by getting the
                        kCMIOStreamPropertyStillImageFormatDescriptions property, or a new CMFormatDescriptionRef can be provided. In the event of the latter, the
                        CMFormatDescriptionEquals() routine will be used to see if the stream can support the provided CMFormatDescriptionRef. Getting this property might inject a
                        discontinuity into the stream if it currently running, depending on the underlying hardware. The returned image might not have the same CMFormatDescriptionRef that
                        was requested.
                        This property is never settable, and is not present for streams which are unable to produce still images.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyStillImageFormatDescriptions
                        A CFArray of CMFormatDescriptionRefs that describe the available still image data formats for the CMIOStream. The client must release the CFArray when done with
                        it. This property is never settable, and is not present for streams which are unable to produce still images.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyFrameRate
                        A Float64 that indicates the current video frame rate of the CMIOStream. The frame rate might fall below this, but it will not exceed it. This property is only present
                        for muxed or video streams which can determine their rate. 
     @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyMinimumFrameRate
                        A Float64 that indicates the minumum video frame rate of the CMIOStream. This property is only present for muxed or video streams which can determine their rate and 
                        guarantee a minimum rate.
   @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyFrameRates
                        An array of Float64s that indicates the valid values for the video frame rate of the CMIOStream. This property is only present for muxed or video streams which can
                        determine their rate. Moreover, it is limited to the rates that correspond to a single CMFormatDescriptionRef, as opposed to the super set of rates that would be
                        associated with the full set of available CMFormatDescriptionRefs.
                        If no qualifier is used, the rates of the current format (as reported via kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescription) will be returned.
                        If a qualifier is present, it contains the CMFormatDescriptionRef whose frame rates are desired. The description can be one of those obtained by getting the
                        kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescriptions property, or a new CMFormatDescriptionRef can be provided. In the event of the latter, the CMFormatDescriptionEquals()
                        routine will be used to see if the stream can support the provided CMFormatDescriptionRef. 
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyFrameRateRanges
                        An array of AudioValueRanges that contains the minimum and maximum ranges for the video frame rate of the CMIOStream.
                        If no qualifier is used, the frame rate ranges of the current format (as reported via kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescription) will be returned.
                        If a qualifier is present, it contains the CMFormatDescriptionRef whose frame rate ranges are desired. The description can be one of those obtained by getting the
                        kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescriptions property, or a new CMFormatDescriptionRef can be provided. In the event of the latter, the CMFormatDescriptionEquals()
                        routine will be used to see if the stream can support the provided CMFormatDescriptionRef. 
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyNoDataTimeoutInMSec
                        A UInt32 that allows a client to specify how much time (in milliseconds) that a device should allow to go by without seeing data before it determines that it is
                        experiencing a period of "no data." The default value is device dependent.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyDeviceSyncTimeoutInMSec
                        A UInt32 that allows a client to specify how much time (in milliseconds) that a device should allow to go by without seeing data before it determines that there is a
                        serious problem, and will never see data. A value of 0 means to ignore checking for the condition. When non-zero, the value takes precedence over
                        kCMIOStreamPropertyNoDataTimeoutInMSec. This property is set by a client when it starts a device and knows by apriori means that data is present; once the client
                        starts seeing data, this value should be reset to 0 by the client. When setting the value, the client should use a value that is long enough to take into account the
                        amount of time the device may need to start up (including, if it has one, starting a transport). A time of 10000ms (10 seconds) is reasonable.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyNoDataEventCount
                        A UInt32 that is incremented every time a period of no data is determined (via the previous two properties). A client can listen to this property to get
                        notifications that no-data events have occured.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyOutputBufferUnderrunCount
                        A UInt32 that is incremented every time a stream's buffers are not being serviced fast enough (such as a DCL overrun when transmitting to a FireWire device).
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyOutputBufferRepeatCount
                        A UInt32 indicating how many times the last output buffer is re-presented to the device when no fresh output buffers are available.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyOutputBufferQueueSize
                        A UInt32 property that allows a client to control how large a queue to hold buffers that are to be sent to the stream; the larger the queue, the more latency until a
                        buffer reaches the stream, but the less likelyhood that data will have to be repeated (or that the stream will run dry). Default value depends on the stream.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyOutputBuffersRequiredForStartup
                        A UInt32 that allows a client to control how many buffers should be accumulated before actually starting to pass them onto the stream. Default value is to use
                        1/2 of the kCMIOStreamPropertyOutputBufferQueueSize.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyOutputBuffersNeededForThrottledPlayback
                        A UInt32 indicating the minimum number of buffers required for the stream to maintain throttled playback without dropping frames. Interested clients can use this to throttle
                        the number of buffers in flight to avoid sending out more frames than necessary, thus helping with memory usage and responsiveness.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyFirstOutputPresentationTimeStamp
                        A CMTime that specifies the presentation timestamp for the first buffer sent to a device; used for startup sync. This property is never settable.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyEndOfData
                        A UInt32 where a value of 1 means that the stream has reached the end of its data and a value of 0 means that more data is available.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyClock
                        A CFTypeRef that encapsulates a clock abstraction for a device's stream. The clock can be created with CMIOStreamClockCreate.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyCanProcessDeckCommand
                        A Boolean that indicates whether or not the stream can process deck commands. This property is never settable.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyDeck
                        A CMIOStreamDeck that represents the current status of a deck associated with a CMIO stream. The definitions of the values in the structure are defined by the deck
                        being controlled. This property is never settable.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyDeckFrameNumber
                        A UInt64 that represents the current frame number read from a deck associated with a stream.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyDeckDropness
                        A UInt32 value that represents the current drop frame state of the deck being controlled. 1 is dropframe, 0 is non-dropframe. This property is never settable.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyDeckThreaded
                        A UInt32 value that represents the deck being controlled's current tape threaded state. 1 deck is threaded, 0 deck is not threaded. This property is never settable.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyDeckLocal
                        A UInt32 value that indicates whether the deck is being controlled locally or remotely. 1 indicates local mode, 0 indicates remote mode. This property is never settable.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyDeckCueing
                        A SInt32 value that represents the current cueing status of the deck being controlled. 0 = cueing, 1 = cue complete, -1 = cue failed. This property is never settable.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyInitialPresentationTimeStampForLinkedAndSyncedAudio
                        A presentation timestamp to be used for a given AudioTimeStamp that was received for audio from the linked and synced CoreAudio audio device that is specified
                        by kCMIOStreamPropertyLinkedAndSyncedCoreAudioDeviceUID. The AudioTimeStamp is passed as the qualifier data. If the DAL device isn't yet read to return a
                        valid time, it should return kCMTimeInvalid. (CMTime)
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyScheduledOutputNotificationProc
                        A procedure to be called when the stream determines when a buffer was output. The procedure and a reference constant are specified by
                        a CMIOStreamScheduledOutputNotificationProcAndRefCon structure.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyPreferredFormatDescription
                        A CMFormatDescriptionRef that describes the preferred format for the CMIOStream. When getting this property, the client must release the CMFormatDescriptionRef when
                        done with it. Either one of the CMFormatDescriptionRefs obtained by getting the kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescriptions property can be used, or a new CMFormatDescriptionRef.
                        CMFormatDescriptionRef can be provided. In the event of the latter, the FigFormatDescriptionEquals() routine will be used to see if the stream can support the provided
                        Setting this property is not a guarantee that the CMIOStream will provide data in this format;  when possible, the CMIOStream will examine all of the values specified by
                        the various clients sharing it, and select the most appropriate configuration. Typically, the value set for this property will only have an effect when the stream is
                        active (unlike kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescription, which takes place immediately). Note that if the client is the device master (set using kCMIODevicePropertyDeviceControl),
                        setting the value of this property *will* directly affect the device, as if kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescription were used.
    @constant       kCMIOStreamPropertyPreferredFrameRate
                        A Float64 that indicates the current preferred video frame rate of the CMIOStream. Setting this property is not a guarantee that the CMIOStream will operate at that
                        framerate;  when possible, the CMIOStream will examine all of the values specified by the various clients sharing it, and select the most appropriate configuration.
                        Typically, the value set for this property will only have an effect when the stream is active (unlike kCMIOStreamPropertyFormatDescription, which takes place immediately).

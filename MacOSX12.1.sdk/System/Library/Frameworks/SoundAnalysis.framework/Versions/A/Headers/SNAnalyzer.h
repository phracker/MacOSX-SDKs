 @param audioFramePosition The frame position of the data in the buffer
 @discussion The framePosition should be a monotonically increasing sample timestamp. If the sample timeline is detected to be non-continuous, the analyzer's internal state may reset to account for the jump. Some types of audio analysis are performed at a fixed block size, which may differ from the buffer sizes provided for analysis. For this reason, an invocation of analyzeAudioBuffer may cause an analysis request observer to be called zero times, one time, or many times, depending on the relationship between the input buffer size, current analyzer state, and native analysis block size. Any errors produced during analysis will be provided through the request observers. This method may block as a means of indicating backpressure to the caller. These methods are not safe to call from a realtime audio context but may be called from lower priority threads (i.e. AVAudioEngine tap callback or AudioQueue callback).

 * @class OSAction
 *
 * @abstract
 * OSAction is an object that represents a callback to be be invoked.
 *
 * @discussion
 * The callback is specified as a method and object pair.
 * State associated with the callback may be allocated and stored for the creator of the object.
 * Methods to allocate an OSAction instance are generated for each method defined in a class with
 * a TYPE attribute. The generated methods are named CreateAction{name of method with type attribute}
 * and have the following declaration:
 *
 * kern_return_t CreateActionNameOfMethod(size_t referenceSize, OSAction **action);
 *
 * referenceSize refers to the size of additional state structure available to the creator of the OSAction
 * with GetReference. If successful, the generated method returns kIOReturnSuccess and a created OSAction
 * through the 'action' parameter with a +1 retain count to be released by the caller. See IOReturn.h for
 * error codes.

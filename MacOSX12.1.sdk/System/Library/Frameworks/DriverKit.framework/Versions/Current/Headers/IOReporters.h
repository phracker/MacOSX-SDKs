/*!
 *  1. Introduction
 *
 *  IOReporting is a mechanism for I/O Kit drivers to gather statistics
 *  (or other information) and make it available to various "observers,"
 *  which are generally in user space. Requests for information come
 *  through two new IOService methods: ::configureReport(...) and
 *  ::updateReport(...). While not required (see IOReportTypes.h), drivers
 *  will generally use IOReporter subclass instances to track the requested
 *  information and respond to IOReporting requests. Drivers can use these
 *  classes to track information, either all the time or between "enable"
 *  and "disable" calls to IOService::configureReport().
 *
 *  Available information is organized into "channels." A channel is
 *  uniquely identified by both driver (registry) ID and a 64-bit channel
 *  ID. One way drivers can advertise their channels is by publishing
 *  "legends" in the I/O Kit registry. In addition to collecting
 *  information and responding to queries, IOReporter objects can produce
 *  legend entries describing their channels. The IOReportLegend class
 *  helps manage legend entries from multiple reporter objects as well
 *  as with grouping channels logically for observers.
 *
 *  An important basic constraint of the current implementation is that
 *  all channels reported by a particular reporter instance must share all
 *  traits except channel ID and name.  Specifically, the channel type
 *  (including report class, categories, & size) and units.  Additionally,
 *  IOHistogramReporter currently only supports one channel at a time.
 *
 *  Currently, ::{configure/update}Report() can be called any time between
 *  when a driver calls registerService() and when free() is called on
 *  your driver. 12960947 tracks improvements / recommendations for
 *  correctly handling these calls during termination.
 *
 * Locking
 *  IOReporting only imposes concurrent access constraints when multiple
 *  threads are accessing the same object.  Three levels of constraint apply
 *  depending on a method's purpose:
 *  1. Allocation/Teardown - same-instance concurrency UNSAFE, MAY BLOCK
 *  2. Configuration - same-instance concurrency SAFE, MAY BLOCK
 *  3. Update - same-instance concurrency SAFE, WILL NOT BLOCK
 *
 *  Configuration requires memory management which can block and must
 *  be invoked with interrupts ENABLED (for example, NOT in the interrupt
 *  context NOR with a spin lock -- like IOSimpleLock -- held).
 *
 *  Updates can be performed with interrupts disabled, but clients should
 *  take into account that IOReporters' non-blocking currenency is achieved
 *  with IOSimpleLockLockDisable/UnlockEnableInterrupts(): that is, by
 *  disabling interrupts and taking a spin lock.  While IOReporting will
 *  never hold a lock beyond a call into it, some time may be spent within
 *  the call spin-waiting for the lock.  Clients holding their own
 *  spin locks should carefully consider the impact of IOReporting's
 *  (small) additional latency before calling it while holding a spin lock.
 *
 *  The documentation for each method indicates any concurrency guarantees.

 *
 *       Legends must be published together as an array under the
 *       kIOReportLegendKey in the I/O Kit registry.  The IOReportLegend
 *       class can be used to properly combine legend entries from multiple
 *       reporters as well as to put channels into groups of interest to
 *       observers.  When published, individual legend entries share
 *       characteristics such as group and sub-group.  Multiple IOReporter
 *       instances are required to produce independent legend entries which
 *       can then be published with different characteristics.
 *
 *       Drivers wishing to publish legends should do so as part of their
 *       ::start() routine.  As superclasses *may* have installed legend
 *       entries, any existing existing legend should be retrieved and
 *       IOReportLegend used to merge it with the new entries.
 *
 *       Recommendations for best practices are forthcoming.
 *
 *       Instead of calling createLegend on your reporter object and then
 *       appending it manually to IOReportLegend, one may prefer to call
 *       IOReportLegend::appendReporterLegend which creates and appends a

 *
 *       Any channels in channelList which are not tracked by this reporter

 *       An IOReporting legend (an OSArray of legend entries) may be already
 *       present in the IORegistry.  Thus the recommended way to publish
 *       new entries is to append to any existing array as follows:
 *       1. call getProperty(kIOReportLegendKey) to get an existing legend.
 *
 *       2a. If it exists
 *       - OSDynamicCast to OSArray
 *       - and pass it to ::with()
 *       IOReportLegend *legendMaker = IOReportLegend::with(legend);
 *       The provided array is retained by IOReportLegend.
 *
 *       2b. If no legend already exists in the registry, pass NULL
 *       IOReportLegend *legend = IOReportLegend::with(NULL);
 *       This latter invocation will cause IOReportLegend to create a new
 *       array internally (also holding one reference).
 *
 *       At the cost of some registry churn, the static
 *       IOReportLegend::addReporterLegend() will handle the above, removing

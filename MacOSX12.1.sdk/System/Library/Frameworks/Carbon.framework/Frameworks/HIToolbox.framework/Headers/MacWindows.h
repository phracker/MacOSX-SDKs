   * use either QuickDraw or CoreGraphics to draw into an overlay
   * window, but you must use CoreGraphics to draw if you need any of
   * your drawing to be non-opaque, since QuickDraw always sets the
   * alpha channel of any pixels that it touches to 1.0. 
   * 
   * Overlay windows support compositing mode on Mac OS X 10.3 and

    About Window Manager Coordinate Spaces
    
    All Window Manager API that takes a size, position, or rectangle for input, and does not take an
    HICoordinateSpace parameter, expects that its input parameters are given in the 72DPIGlobal coordinate
    space. Likewise, any API that returns a rect or region and that does not take an HICoordinateSpace
    parameter will provide its output in the 72DPIGlobal coordinate space.
    
    We expect that most developers will want to work primarily in the 72DPIGlobal space. Doing so makes
    your code independent of the current user interface scale factor, and eases source compatibility with
    earlier versions of Mac OS X that do not support resolution independence. However, there are also certain
    cases where your application must express your window's bounds in pixel coordinates; primarily when you
    need to position your windows so they exactly align with each other or with some other fixed location,
    such as the edge of the display. For these cases, you should use the ScreenPixel coordinate space.
    
    Note that non-integral pixel coordinates are not available in Mac OS X. If you specify non-integral
    coordinates (in either 72DPIGlobal or ScreenPixel coordinate spaces), they will be rounded to the nearest
    integral value in ScreenPixel space when the window is actually positioned or sized.

 *  Summary:
 *    Sets the preferred location for a window's backing buffer.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    In Mac OS X 10.5, the Quartz drawing API supports
 *    hardware-accelerated drawing to a window. In order to enable
 *    hardware acceleration, a window's buffer must be stored in video
 *    memory, rather than in main memory. By default, the location of a
 *    window's buffer is managed automatically by the Window Server.
 *    Your application can use this API to explicitly control a
 *    window's buffer location. You might, for example, need to ensure
 *    that the buffer is kept in main memory if you are drawing
 *    directly into the buffer without using Quartz. You might
 *    explicitly force a window's buffer into video memory if, after
 *    comparing performance with and without hardware acceleration, you
 *    find that acceleration is always a performance advantage for your
 *    application. 
 *    
 *    You may change the backing buffer location of a window at any
 *    time, regardless of whether the window is already visible or has
 *    been drawn to. However, changing the buffer location of a visible
 *    window requires a potentially significant amount of memory
 *    traffic between main and video memory, so it is best to set a
 *    window's buffer location once before showing the window, and not
 *    change it again. 
 *    
 *    The Window Server automatically moves a window's backing buffer
 *    into main memory if the buffer is accessed directly. This occurs
 *    if you draw into a window using QuickDraw, or if you acquire a
 *    pointer to the window buffer using the LockPortBits API. For best
 *    performance, if you know that you will be accessing a window's
 *    buffer using either QuickDraw or direct access, you should force
 *    the window's buffer into main memory before showing the window.

 *  
 *  Result:
 *    The potential location of the window's backing buffer based on
 *    hardware and software configuration. This value indicates whether
 *    the WindowServer is capable of storing the window's buffer in
 *    video or main memory. The determination is based on details of
 *    the current hardware and software configuration, such as whether
 *    the GPU can be used by the WindowServer to store window buffers
 *    and whether the QuartzGL feature is currently enabled for the
 *    entire system or the current application. The return value will
 *    always be either kHIWindowBackingLocationVideoMemory or

 *    return value to determine if the current system configuration is
 *    fast enough to support your desired level of drawing; if, after

 *    requires video-memory storage of window buffers for acceptable
 *    performance, you might alert the user if this function returns

 *    Note that the return value does not indicate the current location

 *  Summary:

 *    
 *    PLEASE NOTE: Apple does not recommend using this API for most
 *    window-ordering purposes. Rather than explicitly setting the
 *    level of a window group, it is preferable to position the group
 *    in the window group hierarchy so that it is between two standard
 *    groups that bracket the desired window level. Doing so will cause
 *    your group to automatically adopt the window level of the
 *    standard group beneath it. Your code will be more compatible with
 *    future versions of Mac OS X if you avoid setting the window level
 *    of your groups explicitly. 
 *    
 *    The most common case where it is appropriate to explicitly set a
 *    window level for your group is when your group's windows need to
 *    be positioned above or below all windows in the standard window
 *    groups. In these cases, you should position your group in the
 *    group hierarchy above or below all standard groups, and then set
 *    the window group level explicitly, if necessary.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    CoreGraphics windows (used to implement all windows in Carbon and
 *    Cocoa applications on Mac OS X) are divided into layers specified
 *    by a window level. Standard window levels are listed in
 *    <CoreGraphics/CGWindowLevel.h>. By default, a new window group
 *    has a window level of kCGNormalWindowLevel. 
 *    
 *    When a window is placed into a window group, its window level is
 *    determined by the window level of its "base group". This is the
 *    containing group that is a child of the root group. For example,
 *    if group A is a child of the root group, and group B is a child
 *    of group A, and window C is in group B, then window C's base
 *    group is group A, and group A's window level determines the level
 *    of window C. 
 *    
 *    SetWindowGroupLevel only allows changing the window level of
 *    groups that are children of the root group. It returns paramErr
 *    for other groups, since a group that is not a child of the root
 *    group is not a base group and changing its level has no effect.
 *    
 *    
 *    Changing the level of a group also changes the level of all
 *    windows currently contained by the group. 
 *    
 *    In Mac OS X 10.4 and later, SetWindowGroupLevel will set all
 *    three window levels associated with a window group: the Active,
 *    Inactive, and Promoted levels. It will then immediately determine
 *    if the Active level needs to be promoted to a larger value, and
 *    if so, set the Promoted level to that value.

 *  Discussion:
 *    See the SetWindowGroupLevel API for a general discussion of

 *    
 *    In Mac OS X 10.4 and later, a window group may have multiple
 *    window levels associated with it; one level for when the

 *    be used to set each level associated with a group. 
 *    
 *    This API can also be used to set the promoted window level that
 *    is actually used for windows in the group; however, we do not
 *    recommend this usage, because the promoted window level is reset
 *    by the Window Manager whenever the window group hierarchy

 *    the promoted level can be overwritten. In general you should only
 *    use this API to set the Active and Inactive window levels.
 *    
 *    
 *    When setting the Active level of a group with the FixedLevel
 *    window group attribute, this API will automatically also set the

 *  GetWindowGroupLevelOfType()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Gets a CoreGraphics window level of a window group.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    See the SetWindowGroupLevel API for a general discussion of
 *    window levels and window groups. 
 *    
 *    In Mac OS X 10.4 and later, a window group may have multiple
 *    window levels associated with it; one level for when the
 *    application is active, and another for when the application is
 *    inactive. The Window Manager automatically switches each group's
 *    level as the application becomes active or inactive. The
 *    GetWindowGroupLevelOfType API can be used to get each level
 *    associated with a group, including the promoted window level that
 *    is actually in use for windows in the group while the application
 *    is active.

 *  CreateStandardWindowMenu()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Creates a standard Window menu for your application. You can call
 *    this to create a window menu for your application. Once you have
 *    the menu, you need to insert it in your menu bar (typically at
 *    the end of your menu list) with a call to InsertMenu. To register
 *    a window to be tracked by this menu, you either create your
 *    window with CreateNewWindow, passing the
 *    kWindowInWindowMenuAttribute, or you can use
 *    ChangeWindowAttributes after the window is created. The Toolbox
 *    takes care of acting on the standard items such as zoom and
 *    minimize, as well as bringing selected windows to the front. All
 *    you need to do is install it and register your windows and the
 *    Toolbox does the rest.
 *    
 *    You may also add your own menu items to the standard window menu.
 *    To do this, we recommend that you use the
 *    GetIndMenuItemWithCommandID API to locate one of the standard
 *    menu items in the menu which is immediately above or below the
 *    location where you wish to insert your items. Then insert your
 *    items relative to the position of the standard menu item. Do not
 *    attempt to search the menu items yourself without calling
 *    GetIndMenuItemWithCommandID; in Mac OS X 10.2,
 *    CreateStandardWindowMenu returns an initially empty menu which is
 *    populated later when the menu is displayed or when
 *    GetIndMenuItemWithCommandID is called, so you will find no items
 *    in the menu unless you first call GetIndMenuItemWithCommandID.
 *    
 *    There is a known bug in all versions of CarbonLib which causes
 *    the Zoom, Collapse, and Uncollapse menu items in the standard
 *    window menu to be non-functional for windows created by the
 *    Dialog Manager. To work around this bug, you can install your own
 *    event handlers on the dialog window for kEventWindowZoom,
 *    kEventWindowCollapse, and kEventWindowExpand, and handle the
 *    event by calling the appropriate Window Manager API.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:

 *      versions of Mac OS X, and in CarbonLib, you must pass zero for
 *      this parameter.

 *  HiliteWindow()

 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Hiliting a window's frame is not the same as activating the
 *    window. A window's hilited state determines whether the window
 *    draws its titlebar and associated widgets as if they were the
 *    frontmost window of its window group, whereas a window's active
 *    state determines whether the window really is the frontmost
 *    window of its window group. Activating or deactivating a window
 *    automatically adjusts a window's hilited state to match.
 *    
 *    In general, only very old compatibility code would ever need or
 *    want to manually modify a window's hilited state via the
 *    HiliteWindow API. Modern clients can typically avoid this API

/*
 *  HIWindowTrackProxyDrag()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Tracks the drag of a window proxy icon.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This API is used by applications that need to manage the dragging
 *    of the proxy icon in their windows. Applications that use the
 *    standard window event hander and that do not need to customize
 *    the proxy icon drag process may rely on the standard handler to
 *    call this API.
 *    
 *    An application may choose whether to allow the Window Manager to
 *    create the drag reference and populate it with drag flavors, or
 *    to create the drag reference itself and adds its own drag
 *    flavors. In the first case, an application should pass NULL for
 *    the drag reference parameter to this API.In the second case, an
 *    application should call BeginWindowProxyDrag to create the drag
 *    reference, add its own flavors, call HIWindowTrackProxyDrag to
 *    track the proxy icon drag, and then EndWindowProxyDrag to release
 *    the drag reference.
 *    
 *    If you pass a non-NULL drag reference, this routine will not
 *    display an outline region for the drag; you are thus expected to
 *    set up a drag image via SetDragImageWithCGImage or a similar API.
 *    Also, in the non- NULL drag reference case, you should not set
 *    the kDragRegionAndImage drag image flag.
 *    
 *    A proxy icon may only be dragged if the window represented by the
 *    proxy icon is not modifed (as indicated by the IsWindowModified
 *    API). This restriction is imposed because a proxy icon is a
 *    representation of a physical file system object, and dragging the
 *    proxy icon may result in the Finder making a copy of the file
 *    system object. If the window is modified, then it contains user
 *    data that has not yet been saved to disk; making a copy of the
 *    file system object would result in a stale copy that did not
 *    contain the userÕs current data.
 *    
 *    By default, all newly created windows are considered to be dirty.
 *    The application must call SetWindowModified( window, false )
 *    before the proxy icon will be draggable.
 *    
 *    In Mac OS X 10.3 and later, the proxy icon is also draggable in
 *    dirty windows if the proxy icon was provided using the
 *    SetWindowProxyIcon or SetWindowProxyCreatorAndType APIs. Dragging
 *    is allowed in this case because the window does not represent an
 *    actual file system object, and therefore there is no risk of user
 *    data loss.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inWindow:
 *      The window whose proxy icon to drag.
 *    
 *    inEvent:
 *      The event that resulted in starting a drag. This will most
 *      commonly be kEventControlTrack, but any event with
 *      kEventParamMouseLocation and kEventParamKeyModifiers parameters
 *      is all that is required.
 *    
 *    inDrag:
 *      The proxy icon drag reference. This parameter may be NULL if
 *      you want the Window Manager to create and populate the drag
 *      reference itself. The Window Manager will add its own drag
 *      flavors to the drag even when the client passes a pre-created
 *      drag reference.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    errUserWantsToDragWindow if the userÕs mouse movements indicated
 *    that the user actually wants to drag the window instead of the
 *    proxy icon (in this case the application should call DragWindow);
 *    windowWrongStateErr if the window was modified and therefore the
 *    proxy icon could not be dragged; noErr if the drag succeeded;

/*
 *  ResizeWindow()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Handles all user interaction while a window is being resized.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The ResizeWindow function moves either an outline of the window's
 *    edges (on Mac OS 9.x and earlier) or the actual window (on Mac OS
 *    X) around the screen, following the userÕs cursor movements, and
 *    handles all user interaction until the mouse button is released.
 *    Unlike the GrowWindow API, there is no need to follow this call
 *    with a call to the function SizeWindow, because once the mouse
 *    button is released, ResizeWindow resizes the window if the user
 *    has changed the window size. Once the resizing is complete,
 *    ResizeWindow draws the window in the new size. Your application
 *    should call the ResizeWindow function instead of the earlier
 *    Window Manager APIs SizeWindow and GrowWindow. Some windows may
 *    allow themselves to be resized from any corner or edge, not just
 *    the bottom right, and as a result, when the user resizes the
 *    window, the window may move on the screen and not merely change
 *    size. ResizeWindow informs your application of the new window
 *    bounds, so that your application can respond to any changes in
 *    the windowÕs position.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inWindow:
 *      The window to be resized.
 *    
 *    inStartPoint:
 *      The point, in global coordinates, at which the original
 *      mouse-down occurred.
 *    
 *    inSizeConstraints:
 *      The limits on the vertical and horizontal measurements of the
 *      content rectangle, in pixels. Although this parameter is typed
 *      as a Rect, the four numbers in the structure represent limits,
 *      not screen coordinates. The top, left, bottom, and right fields
 *      of the structure specify the minimum vertical measurement
 *      (top), the minimum horizontal measurement (left), the maximum
 *      vertical measurement (bottom), and the maximum horizontal
 *      measurement (right). The minimum dimensions should be large
 *      enough to allow a manageable rectangle; 64 pixels on a side is
 *      typical. The maximum dimensions can be no greater than 32,767.
 *      You can pass NULL to allow the user to resize the window to any
 *      size that is contained onscreen.
 *    
 *    outNewContentRect:
 *      On exit, the structure contains the new dimensions of the
 *      windowÕs content region, in global coordinates. On Mac OS 9.x
 *      and earlier, you must pass a non-NULL value in this parameter;
 *      in Carbon, you may pass NULL if you do not need the windowÕs
 *      new dimensions.

 *  ZoomWindowIdeal()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Zooms a window in accordance with human interface guidelines.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Applications should use the ZoomWindowIdeal API instead of the
 *    older ZoomWindow API. When your application calls
 *    ZoomWindowIdeal, it automatically conforms to the human interface
 *    guidelines for determining a windowÕs standard state: the window
 *    is moved as little as possible when switching between user and
 *    standard states, the window is zoomed to the screen that contains
 *    the largest portion of the window, and the window is positioned
 *    in its zoomed-out size to avoid the Dock on Mac OS X. 
 *    
 *    The ZoomWindowIdeal API calculates a windowÕs ideal standard
 *    state and updates a windowÕs ideal user state independently of
 *    the WStateData structure. Previously, the window definition
 *    function was responsible for updating the user state, but because
 *    it relies upon the WStateData structure, the window definition
 *    function is unaware of the ideal standard state and can no longer
 *    track the windowÕs zoom state reliably. The Window Manager
 *    provides the GetWindowIdealUserState and SetWindowIdealUserState
 *    APIs to access a window's current ideal user state, previously
 *    recorded by ZoomWindowIdeal. 
 *    
 *    In Mac OS X 10.7 and later, the ZoomWindowIdeal API automatically
 *    uses an animation to resize the window to its new size, if the
 *    window uses composited mode.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inWindow:
 *      The window to be zoomed.
 *    
 *    inPartCode:
 *      The direction of the zoom, either inZoomIn or inZoomOut. The
 *      value passed in this parameter should generally be determined
 *      by calling IsWindowInStandardState; if IsWindowInStandardState
 *      returns true, pass inZoomIn, otherwise pass inZoomOut.
 *    
 *    ioIdealSize:
 *      When you specify inZoomIn in the inPartCode parameter, this
 *      parameter is unused on entry; you pass a pointer to a Point
 *      structure, but do not fill the structure with data. On exit,
 *      the Point contains the new height and width of the windowÕs
 *      content region, and ZoomWindowIdeal restores the previous ideal
 *      user state. When you specify inZoomOut in the inPartCode
 *      parameter, you pass the ideal height and width of the windowÕs
 *      content region in the Point structure. On return, the Point
 *      contains the new height and width of the windowÕs content
 *      region; ZoomWindowIdeal saves the current user state of the
 *      window and zooms the window to its ideal size for the standard
 *      state. 
 *      
 *      Prior to Mac OS X Mac OS X 10.4, the ZoomWindowIdeal API
 *      malfunctioned if passed an idealSize that was large enough to
 *      cause 16-bit integer overflow when added to the window's
 *      current position. Therefore, when specifying the ideal size
 *      parameter, you should generally not use values that are close
 *      to 32767. It is better to limit your ideal size to, say, 16K.

 *  GetWindowIdealUserState()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Returns the bounds of a windowÕs content region in its user
 *    (zoomed-in) state.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Traditionally, the user (zoomed-in) state of a window has been
 *    stored in the WStateData structure attached to a window. This
 *    field is updated by the window definition when the user clicks on
 *    the zoom box and the window definition determines that the window
 *    is currently not zoomed out. When determining whether the window
 *    is zoomed out, however, the window definition can only look at
 *    the standard state stored in the WStateData field. With the
 *    introduction of the ZoomWindowIdeal API, there is a new basis for
 *    determining whether a window is zoomed out: the windowÕs ideal
 *    size. The window definition does not have access to the windowÕs
 *    ideal size, and therefore cannot accurately determine whether a
 *    window that is zoomed with ZoomWindowIdeal is in its user state
 *    or standard state; therefore, the user state that the window
 *    definition stores in the WStateData is also unreliable. The
 *    ZoomWindowIdeal API therefore stores the windowÕs user state
 *    before zooming out in a new location, which is accessed using the
 *    GetWindowIdealUserState API. The GetWindowIdealUserState API
 *    returns the windowÕs user state most recently recorded by
 *    ZoomWindowIdeal.

 *      content region when zoomed in. On Mac OS X 10.1 and earlier,
 *      and CarbonLib 1.5 and earlier, the windowÕs ideal user state is
 *      an empty rect with coordinates (0,0,0,0) if the window has
 *      never been zoomed out; you should check for an empty rect and
 *      use GetWindowBounds with the kWindowContentRgn selector to
 *      determine the windowÕs current content region. On later

/*
    ¥ Sheets
    
    Sheets are a new user interface object in Mac OS X. A sheet is a modal alert or dialog,
    but unlike a traditional alert or dialog window (which is visually separate from the
    frontmost document window), a sheet appears to be attached to its parent window; it
    moves and z-orders simultaneously with its parent. Furthermore, sheets on Mac OS X
    use a new type of modality called window modality. A traditional alert or dialog is
    app-modal; it prevents user interaction with all other windows in the current application.
    A sheet is window-modal; it only prevents user interaction with its parent window, and
    events continue to flow to other windows in the application.
    
    ¥ Sheet Event Handling
    
    Implementing a sheet window in your application generally requires some modifications
    to your event-handling code. A traditional app-modal window is implemented using a modal
    event loop; your application starts a new event loop (either by processing events itself,
    or by calling ModalDialog), which does not return back to your application's main event
    loop until the app-modal window has closed.
    
    Starting a new event loop doesn't work with sheets, because typically the modal event loop
    will only handle events destined for the sheet, and not events for other windows, but
    a sheet only blocks events for its parent window, and your application must still handle
    events for the rest of its windows as normal. Therefore, you will usually not use a modal
    event loop to handle events in a sheet. Rather, you will show the sheet window, and then
    return directly back to your main event loop. The Carbon Event Manager automatically 
    prevents events from reaching the sheet's parent window; events in your application's
    other windows are still returned to you via WaitNextEvent or your application's Carbon
    event handlers, where you can process them as normal.
    
    You have several choices for handling events in the sheet itself. A sheet is, at the most
    basic level, simply another window in your application, and you can use any of the standard
    event-handling APIs to receive events in the sheet. For example, you can:
    
        -   receive events in the sheet via WaitNextEvent, and handle them directly in your
            main event loop
            
        -   create the sheet using Dialog Manager APIs, and use IsDialogEvent and DialogSelect
            to handle events in the sheet
            
        -   install Carbon event handlers on the sheet, and respond to events in your handlers
    
    Which approach you choose is up to you.
    
    ¥ Sheets in CarbonLib
    
    The sheet window class, sheet WDEF procIDs, and ShowSheetWindow, HideSheetWindow, and
    GetSheetWindowParent APIs are implemented in CarbonLib starting with version 1.3. However,
    since Mac OS 8 and 9 do not traditionally support a window-modal user interface, sheet
    windows are displayed as app-modal windows by CarbonLib. From your application's perspective,
    event handling for a sheet in CarbonLib is the same as event handling for a sheet on X;
    ShowSheetWindow still returns immediately, and your application should still return back
    to its main event loop and be prepared to handle events in other windows. On CarbonLib,
    your application will simply never receive any user input in any of your other windows;
    since the sheet has application modality, the Carbon Event Manager will discard events
    in any windows other than the sheet.
    
    ¥ÊCreating a Sheet
    
    A sheet is just a normal window with a special window class: kSheetWindowClass or
    kSheetAlertWindowClass. As such, it can be created in any of the ways you might create
    a window: NewWindow, NewCWindow, CreateNewWindow, GetNewWindow, GetNewCWindow, 
    CreateWindowFromCollection, CreateWindowFromResource, CreateWindowFromNib, NewDialog,
    NewColorDialog, NewFeaturesDialog, or GetNewDialog.
    
    The Window Manager defines two window classes and two WDEF procIDs for sheets:
        
        -   kSheetWindowClass and kSheetAlertWindowClass
        -   kWindowSheetProc and kWindowSheetAlertProc
        
    The window classes may be used with CreateNewWindow, CreateWindowFromCollection, and
    CreateWindowFromResource; the WDEF procIDs may be used with NewWindow, NewCWindow, NewDialog,
    NewColorDialog, NewFeaturesDialog, and in 'WDEF' and 'DLOG' resources.
    
    Mac OS X 10.0 only supports kSheetWindowClass and kWindowSheetProc;
    it does not support kSheetAlertWindowClass or kWindowSheetAlertProc. The latter window
    class and procID were added in CarbonLib 1.3 and Mac OS X 10.1. A new window class and
    procID were necessary for CarbonLib support because
    sheets can be used for both alerts ("Do you want to save changes before closing this
    window?") and dialogs (a Navigation Services PutFile dialog). On Mac OS X, sheet windows
    have the same appearance when used for either an alert or a dialog, but on Mac OS 8 and 9,
    alert windows have a different appearance from dialog windows. Two separate window classes
    are necessary for CarbonLib to know whether to display a sheet using a movable alert or a
    movable dialog window. Therefore, it is recommended that you use kSheetAlertWindowClass when
    creating a sheet window that will be used to display an alert, although this is not required.
    
    ¥ Displaying a Sheet
    
    A sheet is made visible by calling the ShowSheetWindow API. This API shows the sheet,
    using whatever visual effects are appropriate for the platform, and then returns immediately.
    On Mac OS X, it creates a window group and places the sheet and its parent window into the
    group; it also marks the sheet as window-modal. On CarbonLib, it marks the sheet as app-modal
    but does not create a window group.
    
    On Mac OS X, before the sheet window is actually made visible, ShowSheetWindow sends a 
    kEventWindowDrawContent event to the sheet window, asking it to draw its content into the
    window's offscreen buffer. The sheet must handle this event, or its content area will be
    blank after the sheet becomes visible.
    
    In some cases, this handler is automatically provided for you:
    
        -   If you create your sheet window using the Dialog Manager, the Dialog Manager
            automatically installs a handler for this event that calls DrawDialog, so you
            don't need to install the handler yourself.
            
        -   If you install the standard Carbon window event handler on your sheet window
            (using kWindowStandardHandlerAttribute or InstallStandardEventHandler), the
            standard handler automatically handles this event and calls DrawControls.
            
    Typically, your event handling code (whether it uses WaitNextEvent, the Dialog Manager,
    or Carbon event handlers) will receive and respond to events in the sheet until the
    user does something that should cause the sheet to close. This might be clicking in an
    OK or Cancel button, for example. At that time, your event handling code must call either
    HideSheetWindow or DetachSheetWindow. The sheet window will hide, but will not be destroyed,
    so you can use it again later if you want.
    
    ¥ÊClosing a sheet
    
    A sheet is normally hidden by calling the HideSheetWindow API. HideSheetWindow provides the
    visual effects of zooming the sheet back into the parent window's title bar and moving the
    parent window back to its original position. In Mac OS X 10.3 and later, the DetachSheetWindow
    API is also available. DetachSheetWindow ungroups the sheet from its parent, releases the
    retain count acquired by ShowSheetWindow on the parent window, and removes all event handlers
    installed by ShowSheetWindow, but does not hide the sheet window; an application would typically
    call DetachSheetWindow and then HideWindow to hide the sheet window without the sheet closing
    animation. This may be useful if, for example, the sheet were being used to ask if changes to
    a modified document should be saved; if the user chooses "DonÕt Save", then the application
    could use DetachSheetWindow and then hide both the sheet and the document immediately, so that
    the document closes as quickly as possible without taking time for the closing animation.
    The Navigation Services Save Changes dialog does this automatically.
    
    You _must_ call either HideSheetWindow or DetachSheetWindow before destroying a sheet that has
    been shown with ShowSheetWindow. You may not simply dispose of a sheet window without first using
    Hide or DetachSheetWindow; doing so will leave an extra refcount on the parent window, and will
    leave the parent window still embedded in the sheet window group.
    
    ¥ Sheet Transparency
    
    Sheets should be transparent so that the user can see some of the document content behind
    the sheet and remember the context in which the sheet was displayed. In Mac OS X 10.1, 
    a sheet is made transparent by using the kThemeBrushSheetBackgroundTransparent constant for
    the sheet windowÕs theme background brush. In Mac OS X 10.2 and later, sheets are only
    transparent if this brush is used and if the sheet window uses compositing mode (enabled by
    setting the kWindowCompositingAttribute window attribute when the sheet window is created).

 *  ShowSheetWindow()

 *  Summary:
 *    Shows a sheet window using appropriate visual effects.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    ShowSheetWindow is implemented in both CarbonLib 1.3 and Mac OS
 *    X. Since Mac OS 9 does not use a window-modal user interface for
 *    alerts and dialogs, ShowSheetWindow in CarbonLib does not bind
 *    the sheet to the parent window in the same way that it does on
 *    Mac OS X; instead, it shows the sheet like a standard
 *    movable-modal dialog window. Sheet windows must use the window
 *    classes kSheetWindowClass or kSheetAlertWindowClass to get the
 *    right appearance on both platforms. 
 *    
 *    Note that ShowSheetWindow will increment the retain count of the
 *    parent window. The retain count is decremented by HideSheetWindow
 *    and DetachSheetWindow. You must call one of those APIs before
 *    destroying the sheet window. 
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X, ShowSheetWindow sets the modality of the sheet
 *    window to kWindowModalityWindowModal.

    ¥ Drawers
    
    Drawers are supported in Carbon by Mac OS X 10.2 and later. To create and use a drawer:
    
        -   Create a window using kDrawerWindowClass. You must also use compositing mode with
            drawers; this mode is enabled by passing kWindowCompositingAttribute to CreateNewWindow.
            
        -   Either install the standard window event handler on the drawer window, or use
            your own Carbon event or WaitNextEvent code to handle user interaction with the
            drawer. If you do not use the standard window event handler, you should call
            ResizeWindow in response to clicks on the grow region of the drawer if you want
            the drawer to be resizable.
            
        -   Set the drawer's parent window with the SetDrawerParent function. The parent is
            the window on which the drawer will open.
            
        -   Optionally, install a Carbon event handler on the drawer or the drawer's parent
            window for the kEventWindowDrawerOpening/Opened/Closing/Closed events, to be notified
            when the drawer has started or finished opening or closing.
        
        -   Optionally, set the drawer's preferred edge on the parent window with the
            SetDrawerPreferredEdge function. If you do not set a preferred edge, the drawer
            opens on the parent's left side on a left-to-right system, or on the parent's right
            side on a right-to-left system.
            
        -   Optionally, set the drawer's offsets with the SetDrawerOffsets function. The offsets
            control the amount of inset between the edge of the parent's content area and the edge
            of the drawer's structure. If you do not set any offsets, the drawer's edges are flush
            with the edges of the parent's content.
            
        -   Optionally, set the drawer's minimum and maximum sizes with the SetWindowResizeLimits
            function. Or, install a Carbon event handler on the drawer to handle the kEventWindow-
            GetMinimumSize and kEventWindowGetMaximumSize events. The drawer's minimum and maximum
            sizes control how small or large it will resize together with the parent. If you do not
            set resize limits, the drawer will be capable of resizing to default small and large
            limits.
        
        -   Call ToggleDrawer to open or close the drawer, or use OpenDrawer or CloseDrawer if
            you require more control over how the drawer opens or closes.

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The drawer offsets control the positioning of the drawer relative

 *    height or width equal to the height or width of the content area

 *    the trailing edge of the drawer. The drawer's size is then
 *    adjusted by the leading and trailing offsets. The leading edge of
 *    the drawer is moved inward by an amount equal to the leading
 *    offset, and the trailing edge is moved inward by an amount equal
 *    to the trailing offset. For example, if the leading and trailing
 *    offsets are five and fifteen, then the top edge of a left-opening

 *  ToggleDrawer()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Toggles a drawer from open to closed, or vice versa.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    ToggleDrawer opens the drawer if it is closed, opening, or
 *    closing. If the drawer is open, it closes the drawer.
 *    
 *    ToggleDrawer attempts to open the drawer on its preferred edge,
 *    but if there is not enough room on that edge, it will try the
 *    opposite edge instead. If there is insufficient room on either
 *    edge, the drawer will open on the preferred edge but may extend
 *    offscreen, under the Dock, or under the menubar.
 *    
 *    The opening or closing of the drawer is performed asynchronously;
 *    ToggleDrawer installs an event loop timer that opens or closes
 *    the drawer after ToggleDrawer returns to the caller. Therefore,
 *    the caller must be running its event loop for the drawer to open
 *    or close. To open or close the drawer synchronously, use the
 *    OpenDrawer or CloseDrawer APIs.
 *    
 *    ToggleDrawer retains the drawer window while the drawer is
 *    opening or closing, and releases it when the drawer is fully
 *    opened or closed.
 *    
 *    ToggleDrawer sends the kEventWindowDrawerOpening,
 *    kEventWindowDrawerOpened, kEventWindowDrawerClosing, and
 *    kEventWindowDrawerClosed events as the drawer opens or closes.

    About Custom Toolbar Views
    
    A window with a custom toolbar view does not have an HIToolbarRef. No API that takes an HIToolbarRef will work.
    
    When a custom toolbar view is provided for a window, the Window Manager will:
        - set the view's HIViewID to kHIViewWindowToolbarID
        - embed the toolbar view in the root view of the window
        - make the toolbar view invisible
        
    These aspects of the standard toolbar support also work with custom toolbar views:
        - unmodified clicks on the toolbar button to show and hide the toolbar
        - ShowHideWindowToolbar and IsWindowToolbarVisible
        - kHICommandShow/HideToolbar and kHICommandToggleToolbar
        
    These aspects of the standard toolbar support do _not_ work with custom toolbar views:
        - option-click on toolbar button to toggle all windows with the same toolbar
        - command-click and command-shift-click on toolbar button to change display mode and size
        - command-option click on toolbar button to display config sheet
        
    A custom toolbar view must handle these events:
        - kEventControlGetOptimalBounds
        - kEventControlSetData with kHIToolbarViewDrawBackgroundTag
        - kEventControlDraw and draw, or not, as requested by the background tag
        
    A custom toolbar view may optionally handle:
        - kEventWindowAttributesChanged to be notified when window style changes
        - kHICommandCustomizeToolbar to present its own toolbar customization dialog
        - kHICommandToggleAllToolbars to implement multi-window toggling
        - kHICommandCycleToolbarModeSmaller/Larger to change display mode and size
        
    A custom toolbar view may need to make itself taller or shorter while the view is visible. To ensure
    correct window redraw when this happens, the window frame view must be involved or notified of the
    change in toolbar size. The correct way to do this depends on the Mac OS X version:
    
        - for Mac OS X 10.4.x, the toolbar view should use this code:
        
            WindowRef window = HIViewGetWindow( view );
            DisableScreenUpdates();
            ShowHideWindowToolbar( window, false, false );
            HIViewSetFrame( view, &newBounds );
            ShowHideWindowToolbar( window, true, false );
            EnableScreenUpdates();
        
        - for Mac OS X 10.5 and later, the toolbar view may either use the above code or may instead
          send a kEventControlOptimalBoundsChanged event to itself. The window frame view will observe
          this event and resize the toolbar view automatically. Note that in this case, the view should
          not resize itself; instead, it should be prepared to receive a kEventControlGetOptimalBounds
          event and return its new optimal size in response.

 *  Discussion:
 *    This API is provided for use by applications that cannot use the

 *    Mac OS X, we highly recommend that you use the HIToolbar API if
 *    possible. However, if HIToolbar is not sufficient for your needs,

 *    for defining the appearance and behavior of the view. You cannot
 *    use this API to customize the view that is associated with an
 *    HIToolbarRef; a window with an HIToolbarRef uses a standard

 *  HIWindowInvalidateShadow()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    This API causes a window's shadow to be recalculated.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    HIWindowInvalidateShadow is not typically used by applications.
 *    However, it may be useful for applications with customized window
 *    frames that change shape dynamically; in this case, after the
 *    application has drawn the new window shape, the window shadow
 *    must be recalculated to follow the new window shape. 
 *    
 *    This API causes the window shadow to be immediately recalculated
 *    and redrawn based on the current contents of the window's back
 *    buffer. For best performance and visual appearance, you should
 *    follow these steps when invalidating a window shadow: disable
 *    updates with DisableScreenUpdates, draw, flush, invalidate the
 *    shadow, and enable updates. For a compositing window, after
 *    invalidating any views that should be redrawn, you will need to
 *    explicitly draw and flush using HIWindowFlush, rather than
 *    waiting for the event loop to draw and flush the window, because
 *    you cannot disable updates or invalidate the window shadow if
 *    drawing is done via the event loop.

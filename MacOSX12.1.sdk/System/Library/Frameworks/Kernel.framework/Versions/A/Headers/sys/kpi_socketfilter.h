 *       @header kpi_socketfilter.h
 *       This header defines an API for intercepting communications at the
 *       socket layer.
 *
 *       For the most part, socket filters want to do three things: Filter
 *       data in and out, watch for state changes, and intercept a few calls
 *       for security. The number of function pointers supplied by a socket
 *       filter has been significantly reduced. The filter no longer has any
 *       knowledge of socket buffers. The filter no longer intercepts nearly
 *       every internal socket call. There are two data filters, an in
 *       filter, and an out filter. The in filter occurs before data is
 *       placed in the receive socket buffer. This is done to avoid waking
 *       the process unnecessarily. The out filter occurs before the data is
 *       appended to the send socket buffer. This should cover inbound and
 *       outbound data. For monitoring state changes, we've added a notify
 *       function that will be called when various events that the filter can
 *       not intercept occur. In addition, we've added a few functions that a
 *       filter may use to intercept common operations. These functions are:
 *       connect (inbound), connect (outbound), bind, set socket option,
 *       get socket option, and listen. Bind, listen, connect in, and connect
 *       out could be used together to build a fairly comprehensive firewall
 *       without having to do much with individual packets.

 *       @discussion sf_accept_func is called after a socket is dequeued
 *               off the completed (incoming) connection list and before
 *               the file descriptor is associated with it.  A filter can
 *               utilize this callback to intercept the accepted socket
 *               in order to examine it, prior to returning the socket to
 *               the caller of accept.  Such a filter may also choose to
 *               discard the accepted socket if it wishes to do so.
 *       @param cookie Cookie value specified when the filter attach was called.
 *       @param so_listen The listening socket.
 *       @param so The socket that is about to be accepted.
 *       @param local The local address of the about to be accepted socket.
 *       @param remote The remote address of the about to be accepted socket.
 *       @result Return:
 *               0 - The caller will continue with normal processing of accept.
 *               EJUSTRETURN - The to be accepted socket will be disconnected
 *                   prior to being returned to the caller of accept.  No further
 *                   control or data operations on the socket will be allowed.
 *                   This is the recommended return value as it has the least
 *                   amount of impact, especially to applications which don't
 *                   check the error value returned by accept.
 *               Anything Else - The to be accepted socket will be closed and
 *                   the error will be returned to the caller of accept.
 *                   Note that socket filter developers are advised to exercise
 *                   caution when returning non-zero values to the caller,
 *                   since some applications don't check the error value
 *                   returned by accept and therefore risk breakage.

/*!
 *   @class IODMACommand
 *   @abstract A mechanism to convert memory references to I/O bus addresses.
 *   @discussion The IODMACommand is supersedes the IOMemoryCursor and greatly enhances the functionality and power of it.  The command can be specified to output 64 bit physical addresses and also allows driver writers bypass mapping hardware or get addresses suitable for non-snooped DMA.
 *  <br><br>
 *   The command is designed to be very easily subclassable.  Most driver writers need to associate some DMA operations with their memory descriptor and usually use a C structure for that purpose.  This structure is often kept in a linked list.  This IODMACommand has built it <kern/queue.h> linkage and can be derived and 'public:' variables added, giving the developer a structure that can associate a memory descriptor with a particular dma command but will also allow the developer to generate that command and keep the state necessary for tracking it.
 *  <br><br>
 *   It is envisaged that a pool of IODMACommands will be created at driver initialisation and each command will be kept in an IOCommandPool while not in use.  However if developers wishes to maintain their own free lists that is certainly possible.  See the <kern/queue.h> and <xnu/iokit/Kernel/IOCommandPool> for sample code on manipulating the command's doubly linked list entries.
 *  <br><br>
 *   The IODMACommand can be used in a 'weak-linked' manner.  To do this you must avoid using any static member functions.  Use the, much slower but safe, weakWithSpecification function.  On success a dma command instance will be returned.  This instance can then be used to clone as many commands as is needed.  Remember deriving from this class can not be done weakly, that is no weak subclassing!

/*! @function prepareWithSpecification
 *   @abstract Prepare the memory for an I/O transfer with a new specification.
 *   @discussion Allocate the mapping resources neccessary for this transfer, specifying a sub range of the IOMemoryDescriptor that will be the target of the I/O.  The complete() method frees these resources.  Data may be copied to buffers for kIODirectionOut memory descriptors, depending on hardware mapping resource availabilty or alignment restrictions.  It should be noted that the this function may block and should only be called on the clients context, i.e never call this routine while gated; also the call itself is not thread safe though this should be an issue as each IODMACommand is independant.
 *   @param outSegFunc SegmentFunction to call to output one physical segment. A set of nine commonly required segment functions are provided.
 *   @param numAddressBits Number of bits that the hardware uses on its internal address bus. Typically 32 but may be more on modern hardware.  A 0 implies no-restriction other than that implied by the output segment function.
 *   @param maxSegmentSize Maximum allowable size for one segment.  Defaults to 0 which means any size.
 *   @param mappingOptions is the type of mapping that is required to translate an IOMemoryDescriptor into the desired number of bits.  For instance if your hardware only supports 32 bits but must run on machines with > 4G of RAM some mapping will be required.  Number of bits will be specified in numAddressBits, see below.This parameter can take 3 values:- kNonCoherent - used for non-coherent hardware transfers, Mapped - Validate that all I/O bus generated addresses are within the number of addressing bits specified, Bypassed indicates that bypassed addressing is required, this is used when the hardware transferes are into coherent memory but no mapping is required.  See also prepare() for failure cases.
 *   @param maxTransferSize Maximum size of an entire transfer.	Defaults to 0 indicating no maximum.
 *   @param alignment Alignment restriction, in bytes, on I/O bus addresses.  Defaults to single byte alignment.
 *   @param mapper For mapping types kMapped & kBypassed mapper is used to define the hardware that will perform the mapping, defaults to the system mapper.
 *   @param offset defines the starting offset in the memory descriptor the DMA command will operate on. genIOVMSegments will produce its results based on the offset and length passed to the prepare method.
 *   @param length defines the ending position in the memory descriptor the DMA command will operate on. genIOVMSegments will produce its results based on the offset and length passed to the prepare method.
 *   @param flushCache Flush the caches for the memory descriptor and make certain that the memory cycles are complete.  Defaults to true for kNonCoherent and is ignored by the other types.
 *   @param synchronize Copy any buffered data back from the target IOMemoryDescriptor.  Defaults to true, if synchronize() is being used to explicitly copy data, passing false may avoid an unneeded copy.
 *   @result An IOReturn code. Can fail if the mapping type is not recognised, if one of the 3 mandatory parameters are set to 0, if a 32 bit output function is selected when more than 32 bits of address is required or, if kBypassed is requested on a machine that doesn't support bypassing.

/*! @struct IOPMPowerState
 *   @abstract Describes a device's power state.
 *   @discussion To take part in system power management, drivers should define an array of 2 or more power states and pass it to kernel power management through IOService::registerPowerDriver.
 *   @field version Defines version number of this struct. Just use the value "1" when defining an IOPMPowerState.
 *   @field	capabilityFlags Describes the capability of the device in this state.
 *   @field	outputPowerCharacter Describes the power provided in this state.
 *   @field	inputPowerRequirement Describes the input power required in this state.
 *   @field	staticPower Describes average consumption in milliwatts. Unused; drivers may specify 0.
 *   @field	stateOrder Valid in version kIOPMPowerStateVersion2 or greater of this structure. Defines ordering of power states independently of the power state ordinal.
 *   @field	powerToAttain Describes dditional power to attain this state from next lower state (in milliWatts). Unused; drivers may specify 0.
 *   @field	timeToAttain Describes time required to enter this state from next lower state (in microseconds). Unused; drivers may specify 0.
 *   @field	settleUpTime Describes settle time required after entering this state from next lower state (microseconds). Unused; drivers may specify 0.
 *   @field timeToLower Describes time required to enter next lower state from this one (microseconds). Unused; drivers may specify 0.
 *   @field	settleDownTime Settle time required after entering next lower state from this state (microseconds). Unused; drivers may specify 0.
 *   @field	powerDomainBudget Describes power in milliWatts a domain in this state can deliver to its children. Unused; drivers may specify 0.

/*! @class      MPSNDArray
 *  @abstract   A MPSNDArray object is a MTLBuffer based storage container for multi-dimensional data.
 *  @discussion Operations on MPSNDArrays will commonly implicitly reshape the multidimensional
 *              structure into a 2-dimensional structure by reinterpreting higher dimensions as a single dimensional
 *              array of matrix rows. For example a [a, b, c, d] NDArray passed to a matrix multiplication may
 *              be implicitly reinterpreted as a [a*b*c, d] matrix and a 2D matrix multiplication performed.
 *              In practice, the major row (the dimension in which successive elements appear adjacent to one
 *              another in memory) is the 0th dimension (represented as 'd' in the above example).  It has both a
 *              dimension size indicating the number of elements and a storage size which may be slightly bigger
 *              to allow for performance improvement arising from better data alignment in memory.  In principle,
 *              the rowBytes may also be used to create a 0th-dimension slice out of a larger array stored in the
 *              underlying MTLBuffer.
 *
 *              MPS will automatically manage the storage size of the major row ("rowBytes") though you may
 *              set it in the descriptor if you have a need to do so. Generally, it should be at least a multiple
 *              of 16 bytes.   Dimensions after the 0th are a densely packed array of rows of size rowBytes.
 *              Thus, the 1st dimension is an array of rows. The 2nd dimension is an array of arrays of rows with
 *              identical size, and so forth.  When the reduction to 2 dimensions is done, no data is moved. MPS
 *              just reinterprets a higher order N-1 dimensions of matrix rows as a single large 1-dimensional
 *              array of rows.
 *
 *              It is a common desire to reorder the dimensions of NDArrays or define a subregion thereof. A transpose
 *              or slice operation is performed by making a MPSNDArray view of the original. The dimensions to transpose
 *              or slice are given by the descriptor for the new view. If both a transpose and slice operation are defined,
 *              then the slice is performed first and the result of the slice is transposed. Because many MPS kernels can
 *              operate on transposed data at speed, MPS will usually defer doing a physical transpose operation until later,
 *              when it becomes clear that one is actually required. For this reason, conversions to formats that do not
 *              support deferred transposes and slices such as MPSMatrix MPSVector view or using -exportWithCommandBuffer:
 *              toBuffer:offset:rowStrides, may cause substantial new computation to be done and new memory to be allocated.
 *              These should be avoided except when necessary.  As a general rule, transposes that do not involve the 0th
 *              dimension should be able to be handled by nearly everything natively. MPSNDArrayMatrixMultiplication and reductions
 *              can handle 0th dimension transposes. Other filters may insert a physical repacking operation. If you wish
 *              to force a physical repacking use MPSAliasingStrategyShallNotAlias. To avoid confusion with aliased NDArrays
 *              the parent property is provided.  MPSNDArrays that alias share a common ancestor.

 *                  memory recycling, each time a MPSTemporaryNDArray is read by a

 *                  decremented. When the readCount reaches 0, the underlying buffer is

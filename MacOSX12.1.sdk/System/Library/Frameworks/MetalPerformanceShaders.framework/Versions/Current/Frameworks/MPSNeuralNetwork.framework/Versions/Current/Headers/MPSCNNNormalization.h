 *              (see @ref MPSCNNSpatialNormalization) in that it applies the filter over local regions which extend
 *              spatially, but are in separate feature channels (i.e., they have shape 1 x kernelWidth x kernelHeight),
 *              but instead of dividing by the local "energy" of the feature, the denominator uses the local variance
 *              of the feature - effectively the mean value of the feature is subtracted from the signal.
 *              For each feature channel, the function computes the variance VAR(i,j) and
 *              mean M(i,j) of X(i,j) inside each rectangle around the spatial point (i,j).
 *
 *              Then the result is computed for each element of X as follows:

 *              unit variance and zero mean, provided that input variance is positive.

 *               This normalization filter applies the filter to a local region across nearby feature channels,
 *              but with no spatial extent (i.e., they have shape kernelSize x 1 x 1).
 *              The normalized output is given by:
 *                  Y(i,j,k) = X(i,j,k) / L(i,j,k)^beta,
 *              where the normalizing factor is:
 *                  L(i,j,k) = delta + alpha/N * (sum_{q in Q(k)} X(i,j,q)^2, where
 *              N is the kernel size. The window Q(k) itself is defined as:
 *                  Q(k) = [max(0, k-floor(N/2)), min(D-1, k+floor((N-1)/2)], where
 *
 *              k is the feature channel index (running from 0 to D-1) and
 *              D is the number of feature channels, and alpha, beta and delta are paremeters.
 *              It is the end-users responsibility to ensure that the combination of the
 *              parameters delta and alpha does not result in a situation where the denominator
 *              becomes zero - in such situations the resulting pixel-value is undefined.
 *
 *              OutputGradient:
 *                  dZ/dX(i,j,k) = dZ/dY(i,j,k) * (L(i,j,k)^-beta) - 2 * alpha * beta * X(i,j,k) * ( sum_{r in R(k)} dZ/dY(i,j,r) * X(i,j,r) * (L(i,j,r) ^ (-beta-1)) )
 *              N is the kernel size. The window L(i) and K(j) itself is defined as:
 *                  R(k) = [max(0, k-floor((N-1)/2)), min(D-1, k+floor(N/2)]
 *
 *              For correct gradient computation all parameters must be the same as the original normalization filter.

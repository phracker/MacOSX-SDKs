    @method initWithSourceGroups:targetGroups:attenuation:attackTime:releaseTime:
    @discussion
        Whenever a generator node from any source group plays, all the generator nodes in the target groups will be
        ducked by the given gain using the given attack and release times.
    @note
        The ducker is initialially inactive. The client must call activate() to make it active.
        Once a ducker is active, it will listen for generator nodes to start playback in source groups. Once triggered, it will duck its target groups.
        Deactivating a ducker will make it stop listening. Furthermore, it will enter the release phase if it has been previously triggered.
        Dealloc'ing a ducker will force the ducker into its release phase if it is actively ducking and remove it from the system when it finishes.
    @param engine
        The engine to register this ducker with.
    @param sourceGroups
        The source groups that will trigger the ducker when a sound in one of the source groups starts playback.
    @param targetGroups
        The target groups that will be ducked when a sound in one of the source groups triggers the ducker.
    @param gain
        The linear gain scalar to apply when the ducker is engaged. 0 means full attenuation. 1 is no attenuation. Values are clamped to the range [0, 1].
    @param attackTime
        The time for the attenuation gain to ramp into effect.
        This value is scaled by unitsPerSecond internally, so can be provided at the client's native time scale.
    @param releaseTime
        The time for the ducked sounds to ramp back to their original level.
        This value is scaled by unitsPerSecond internally, so can be provided at the client's native time scale.
    @param attackCurve
        The type of curve function to use during the attack phase of gain reduction.
    @param releaseCurve
        The type of curve function to use during the release phase of gain reduction.

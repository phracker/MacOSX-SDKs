    @abstract An instance of this class represents a single SDP service record.
    @discussion As a service record, an instance of this class has an NSDictionary of service attributes.
                It also has a link to the IOBluetoothDevice that the service belongs to.  The service
                dictionary is keyed off of the attribute ID of each attribute represented as an NSNumber.

/*!
 @method		publishedServiceRecordWithDictionary:
 @abstract      Adds a service to the local SDP server.
 @result		Returns an IOBluetoothSDPServiceRecord * with the attributes specified in the provided dictionary.

 @discussion	Each entry in the dictionary representing the service contains the individual attributes.  Each
 attribute in the dict is keyed by a string that must begin with a hex number representing the
 attribute ID.  The key string may contain additional characters if desired as long as they
 follow a space after the ID hex string.  The attribute value must follow the dictionary format
 described by IOBluetoothSDPDataElement.  This dictionary format allows a service dict to be
 created as a plist file and then loaded into the system rather than built up in code.  See the
 example code for an example of how can be done.
 
 If the service record handle, L2CAP PSM or RFCOMM channel ID specified in the dictionary are in
 use, an alternate one will be assigned.
 
 In addition to attributes that represent the service itself, additional attributes may be specified
 that control the local behavior of the service.  To specify these local attributes, an additional
 property titled "LocalAttributes" may be added to the root of the service dict.  The value of this
 property must be a dictionary that contains the individual local attributes.
 
 Currently, only two local attributes are supported: "Persistent" and "TargetApplication".
 
 The "Persistent" local attribute must be either a boolean or number representing whether the service
 should be persistent.  A persistent service will be saved off and restored any time the Bluetooth
 hardware is present.  It will persist through reboots and can only be removed by calling
 IOBluetoothRemoveServiceWithRecordHandle(void).  This attribute is optional.  By default, if no
 "Persistent" local property is present,	the service will only exist temporarily.  It will
 be removed either when IOBluetoothRemoveServiceWithRecordHandle(void) is called or when the client
 application exits.
 
 The "TargetApplication" local attribute is used to specify an application to be launched when a
 remote device attempts to connect to the service (by opening either an L2CAP or RFCOMM channel of
 the type specified in the service).  This value must be a string representing the absolute path to
 the target executable (not just the .app wrapper - i.e.
 /System/Library/CoreServices/OBEXAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/OBEXAgent).  This attribute is optional.
 If no "TargetApplication" local attribute is specified, no special action will take place when an
 incoming connection to the service is created.  It is up to the client to be monitoring for the
 connection and to do the right thing when one appears.
 
 The "LocalAttributes" property is optional.  If it is not specified, by default the created service
 is transient and will be removed when the client exits.
 
 Additional local attributes to further control incoming services will be added in the future.

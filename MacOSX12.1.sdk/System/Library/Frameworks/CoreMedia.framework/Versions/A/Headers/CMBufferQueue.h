	@header
	@abstract	API for creating and using CMBufferQueues.
	@discussion	CMBufferQueues are CF-based objects that implement a queue of timed buffers.  These buffers can be of any
				CF-based type (CFTypeRef), but must have a concept of duration.  During CMBufferQueue creation,
				a set of callbacks is provided, one of which is a required callback that returns the duration of
				the CF-based buffer object.  A standard callback struct for CMSampleBuffers is provided as a
				convenience.  These callbacks are called synchronously from within various CMBufferQueue APIs,
				on the thread that called the API.
				
				CMBufferQueues are designed to be read and written from different threads in a producer/consumer
				model.  While this is generally two threads (one producer/enqueuer, one dequeuer/consumer),
				CMBufferQueues can service any number of threads enqueueing and/or dequeueing buffers.  Inside 
				the CMBufferQueue APIs, all operations (not just Enqueue and Dequeue, but GetDuration,
				InstallTrigger, etc) are made atomic by use of a single mutex (one mutex per created queue object).
				
				By default, a CMBufferQueue is a FIFO queue, but if a comparison callback is provided, the
				resulting CMBufferQueue will be sorted based on that callback.  For example, one might create
				a CMBufferQueue where the buffers are enqueued in decode order, and dequeued in presentation
				order, by providing a comparison callback that sorts by presentation timestamp.
				
				CMBufferQueues retain the enqueued buffer during Enqueue, so the client can release the buffer if it
				has no further need of the reference.  During DequeueAndRetain, the buffer is retained on behalf of
				the client, and released by the queue.  The result is that the retain count remains the same, and the
				ownership of the buffer is transferred from the queue to the client.
				
				If provided with a buffer-readiness callback, CMBufferQueues can check for buffer readiness during
				DequeueIfDataReadyAndRetain.  If that callback is not provided, all buffers are assumed to be ready, and
				there is no difference between DequeueAndRetain and DequeueIfDataReadyAndRetain.
				
				CMBufferQueues also implement GetMinDecodeTimeStamp and GetMinPresentationTimeStamp, with the
				help of optional callbacks that get decode and presentation timestamps from a buffer.  If either or both
				of these callbacks is not provided, kCMTimeInvalid will be returned for the missing timestamp(s).
				
				CMBufferQueues can be marked with an end-of-data (MarkEndOfData).  Once so marked, further enqueues will
				fail, and once all the buffers have been dequeued, the queue is permanently empty ("at end of data") until
				Reset is called.  Reset empties the queue and undoes the end-of-data marking.
				
				The current status of a CMBufferQueue can be interrogated.  Clients can test for emptiness (IsEmpty), current
				queue duration (GetDuration), and end-of-data status (ContainsEndOfData and IsAtEndOfData).
				
				Trigger callbacks can be installed by clients (InstallTrigger), to get notifications of various queue state
				transitions, such as "duration becomes less than 1 second".  The queue cannot be modified during a trigger
				callback, but it can be interrogated.  Trigger conditions can be tested explicitly as well (TestTrigger).
				Triggers with NULL callbacks can be added to a queue for this type of use, but triggers with callbacks can
				also have their conditions explicitly tested.
				
				Trigger callbacks may be called from any CMBufferQueue API that modifies the total duration of the queue
				(eg. Enqueue/Dequeue/Reset). Trigger callbacks are called synchronously, on the thread that called the API.
				
				Modifying the state of the queue in any way from within a trigger callback is forbidden, and will fail,
				returning kCMBufferQueueError_CannotModifyQueueFromTriggerCallback.
				
				An attempt to Enqueue onto a full queue or to Dequeue from an empty queue will not block, but will return
				immediately with an error (or with a NULL buffer).  Triggers should be installed by the client to manage
				the client's knowledge of queue fullness.  The use of repeated retries (polling) is discouraged as an
				inefficient use of resources.

				IMPORTANT: Clients of CMBufferQueue must explicitly manage the retain count by 
				calling CFRetain and CFRelease, even in processes using garbage collection.

				Objective-C code that may run under garbage collection should NOT use [bufq retain],
				or [bufq release]; these will not have the correct effect.

				Furthermore, if they may run under garbage collection, Objective-C objects that release 
				instance variable CMBufferQueue objects during their -finalize methods should set those 
				object pointers to NULL immediately afterwards, to ensure that method calls received 
				after -finalize operate safely.

	@typedef	CMBufferQueueTriggerToken
	@abstract	A reference to a CMBufferQueueTrigger object.  It is not a CF type; do not CFRetain or CFRelease it.
	@discussion	A trigger is a callback function that the queue calls every time the triggering condition becomes true.
				Trigger conditions include things like queue duration, queue buffer count, etc.
				Trigger callbacks are called from within CMBufferQueue routines that modify the trigger condition
				(eg. Enqueue/Dequeue/Reset).
				
				Trigger callbacks cannot modify the queue that called them; they can, however, interrogate it.
				Trigger callbacks should not block waiting for other threads to modify or interrogate the queue either.
				In fact, trigger callbacks should perform as little processing as possible, preferably arranging
				for processing to occur by signalling a semaphore, rescheduling a runloop timer, calling dispatch_async(), etc.
				
				Clients can install as many triggers as they like.  The order in which they are called is non-deterministic.
				
				Triggers with a NULL callback are valid, since even though no trigger callback will be called, the
				trigger condition can still be explicitly tested.

				The CMBufferQueueTriggerToken is returned from CMBufferQueueInstallTrigger, so clients can remove
				it later if necessary.  Triggers will automatically be removed when the queue is finalized.  Note
				that if more than one module has access to a queue, it may be hard for an individual module to know
				when the queue is finalized since other modules may retain it.  To address this concern, modules
				should remove their triggers before they themselves are finalized.

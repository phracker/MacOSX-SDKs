 * @function os_proc_available_memory
 *
 * @abstract
 * Return the number of bytes remaining, at the time of the call, before the
 * current process will hit its current dirty memory limit.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Developers can query this value efficiently whenever it is needed. The return
 * value is only a snapshot at the time of the call. Caching the result is not
 * advised. The result may be instantaneously invalidated by actions taken in
 * another thread or another framework.
 *
 * Memory limits can change during the app life cycle. Make sure to check accordingly.
 *
 * The size returned is not representative of the total memory of the device, it
 * is the current dirty memory limit minus the dirty memory footprint used at the
 * time of the query.
 *
 * This interface allows an app to efficiently consume all available memory resources.
 * Significant memory use, even under the current memory limit, may still cause
 * system-wide performance including the termination of other apps and system
 * processes. Take care to use the minimum amount of memory needed to satisfy the
 * userâ€™s need.
 *
 * If you need more information than just the available memory, you can use task_info().
 * The information returned is equivalent to the task_vm_info.limit_bytes_remaining
 * field. task_info() is a more expensive call, and will return information such
 * as your phys_footprint, which is used to calculate the return of this function.
 *
 * Dirty memory contains data that must be kept in RAM (or the equivalent) even
 * when unused. It is memory that has been modified.
 *
 * @param none
 *
 * @result
 * The remaining bytes. 0 is returned if the calling process is not an app, or
 * the calling process exceeds its memory limit.

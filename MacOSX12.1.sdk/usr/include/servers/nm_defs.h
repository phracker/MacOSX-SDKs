/*
 * HISTORY:
 * 27-Mar-90  Gregg Kellogg (gk) at NeXT
 *	include <sys/netport.h> rather than <sys/ipc_netport.h>
 *
 * 24-Aug-88  Daniel Julin (dpj) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Replace sys/mach_ipc_netport.h with kern/ipc_netport.h. Sigh.
 *
 * 24-May-88  Daniel Julin (dpj) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Replace mach_ipc_vmtp.h with mach_ipc_netport.h.
 *
 *  4-Sep-87  Daniel Julin (dpj) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Fixed for new kernel include files which declare a lot
 *	of network server stuff internally, because of the NETPORT
 *	option.
 *
 *  5-Nov-86  Robert Sansom (rds) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Started.

 @enum compression_algorithm
 
 @abstract Tag used to select a compression algorithm.
 
 @discussion libcompression supports a number of different compression
 algorithms, but we have only implemented algorithms that we believe are the
 best choice in some set of circumstances; there are many, many compression
 algorithms that we do not provide because using one of the algorithms we
 do provide is [almost] always a better choice.
 
 There are four commonly-known encoders implemented: LZ4, zlib (level 5),
 LZMA (level 6) and Brotli (level 2). If you require that your compression be interoperable
 with non-Apple devices, you should use one of these three schemes:
 
    - Use LZ4 if speed is critical, and you are willing to sacrifice
    compression ratio to achieve it.
 
    - Use LZMA if compression ratio is critical, and you are willing to
    sacrifice speed to achieve it.  (Note: the performance impact of making
    this choice cannot be overstated.  LZMA is an order of magnitude slower
    for both compression and decompression than other schemes).
 
    - Use zlib otherwise.
 
 If you do not require interoperability with non-Apple devices, use LZFSE
 in the place of zlib in the hierarchy above.  It is an Apple-developed
 algorithm that is faster than, and generally compresses better than zlib.
 It is slower than LZ4 and does not compress as well as LZMA, however, so
 you will still want to use those algorithms in the situations described.

 Brotli is a widely adopted content-encoding-method for the web. Thus, Brotli
 is included in libcompression escpecially to provide decoding capabilities.
 In many other use-cases, one of the above mentioned algorithms is probably a
 better choice.

 Further details on the supported public formats, and their implementation
 in the compression library:
 
 - LZ4 is an extremely high-performance compressor.  The open source version
   is already one of the fastest compressors of which we are aware, and we
   have optimized it still further in our implementation.  The encoded format
   we produce and consume is compatible with the open source version, except
   that we add a very simple frame to the raw stream to allow some additional
   validation and functionality.
 
   The frame is documented here so that you can easily wrap another LZ4
   encoder/decoder to produce/consume the same data stream if necessary.  An
   LZ4 encoded buffer is a sequence of blocks, each of which begins with a
   header.  There are three possible headers:
 
        a "compressed block header" is (hex) 62 76 34 31, followed by the
        size in bytes of the decoded (plaintext) data represented by the
        block and the size (in bytes) of the encoded data stored in the
        block.  Both size fields are stored as (possibly unaligned) 32-bit
        little-endian values.  The compressed block header is followed
        immediately by the actual lz4-encoded data stream.
 
        an "uncompressed block header" is (hex) 62 76 34 2d, followed by the
        size of the data stored in the uncompressed block as a (possibly
        unaligned) 32-bit little-endian value.  The uncompressed block header
        is followed immediately by the uncompressed data buffer of the
        specified size.
 
        an "end of stream header" is (hex) 62 76 34 24, and marks the end
        of the lz4 frame.  No further data may be written or read beyond 
        this header.
 
   If you are implementing a wrapper for a raw LZ4 decoder, keep in mind that
   a compressed block may reference data from the previous block, so the
   (decoded) previous block must be available to the decoder.
 
 - We implement the LZMA level 6 encoder only.  This is the default compression
   level for open source LZMA, and provides excellent compression.  The LZMA
   decoder supports decoding data compressed with any compression level.
 
 - We implement the zlib level 5 encoder only.  This compression level provides
   a good balance between compression speed and compression ratio.  The zlib
   decoder supports decoding data compressed with any compression level.

   The encoded format is the raw DEFLATE format as described in IETF RFC 1951.
   Using the ZLIB library, the equivalent configuration of the encoder would be
   obtained with a call to:

        deflateInit2(zstream,5,Z_DEFLATED,-15,8,Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY)

 - LZ4_RAW is supported by the buffer APIs only, and encodes/decodes payloads
   compatible with the LZ4 library, without the frame headers described above.

 - We implement Brotli level 2 encoder only. This compression level provides
   a good balance between compression speed and compression ratio. The Brotli
   decoder supports decoding data compressed with any compression level.

 ******************************************************************************/

/*  The stream interfaces satisfy a number of needs for which the raw-buffer
    interfaces are unusable.  There are two critical features of the stream
    interfaces that enable these uses:
 
      * They allow encoding and decoding to be resumed from where it ended
        when the end of a source or destination block was reached.
 
      * When resuming, the new source and destination blocks need not be
        contiguous with earlier blocks in the stream; all necessary state
        to resume compression is represented by the compression_stream object.
 
    These two properties enable tasks like:
 
      * Decoding a compressed stream into a buffer with the ability to grow
        the buffer and resume decoding if the expanded stream is too large
        to fit without repeating any work.
 
      * Encoding a stream as pieces of it become available without ever needing
        to create an allocation large enough to hold all the uncompressed data.
 
    The basic workflow for using the stream interface is as follows:
 
        1. initialize the state of your compression_stream object by calling
        compression_stream_init with the operation parameter set to specify
        whether you will be encoding or decoding, and the chosen algorithm
        specified by the algorithm parameter.  This will allocate storage
        for the state that allows encoding or decoding to be resumed 
        across calls.
 
        2. set the dst_buffer, dst_size, src_buffer, and src_size fields of
        the compression_stream object to point to the next blocks to be
        processed.
 
        3. call compression_stream_process.  If no further input will be added
        to the stream via subsequent calls, finalize should be non-zero.
        If compression_stream_process returns COMPRESSION_STATUS_END, there
        will be no further output from the stream.
 
        4. repeat steps 2 and 3 as necessary to process the entire stream.
 
        5. call compression_stream_destroy to free the state object in the
        compression_stream.

 Processes the buffers described by the stream object until the source buffer
 becomes empty, or the destination buffer becomes full, or the entire stream is
 processed, or an error is encountered.

 read from the source, all output (including an end-of-stream marker) has been
 written to the destination, and COMPRESSION_STREAM_FINALIZE bit is set.
 
 When decoding COMPRESSION_STATUS_END is returned only if all input (including
 and end-of-stream marker) has been read from the source, and all output has
 been written to the destination.
 
 COMPRESSION_STATUS_OK is returned if all data in the source buffer is consumed,
 or all space in the destination buffer is used. In that case, further calls
 to compression_stream_process are expected, providing more data in the source
 buffer, or more space in the destination buffer.
 
 COMPRESSION_STATUS_ERROR is returned if an error is encountered (if the
 encoded data is corrupted, for example).

 When decoding a valid stream, the end of stream will be detected from the contents
 of the input, and COMPRESSION_STATUS_END will be returned in that case, even if
 COMPRESSION_STREAM_FINALIZE is not set, or more input is provided.

 When decoding a corrupted or truncated stream, if COMPRESSION_STREAM_FINALIZE is not
 set to notify the decoder that no more input is coming, the decoder will not consume
 or produce any data, and return COMPRESSION_STATUS_OK.  In that case, the client code
 will call compression_stream_process again with the same state, entering an infinite loop.
 To avoid this, it is strongly advised to always set COMPRESSION_STREAM_FINALIZE when
 no more input is expected, for both encoding and decoding.

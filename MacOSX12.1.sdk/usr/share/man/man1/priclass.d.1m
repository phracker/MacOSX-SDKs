.TH priclass.d 1m  "Apr 22, 2006" "version 1.00" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
priclass.d \- priority distribution by scheduling class. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B priclass.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple DTrace script that samples at 1000 Hz the current
thread's scheduling class and priority. A distribution plot is printed.

With priorities, the higher the priority the better chance the thread
has of being scheduled.

This idea came from the script /usr/demo/dtrace/pri.d, which
produces similar output for priority changes, not samples.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
This samples until Ctrl\-C is hit.

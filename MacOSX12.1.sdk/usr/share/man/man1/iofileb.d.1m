.TH iofileb.d 1m  "Feb 20, 2006" "version 1.00" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
iofileb.d \- I/O bytes by file and process. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iofileb.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This prints a summary of requested disk activity by pathname,
providing totals of the I/O events in bytes. It is a companion to the
iofile.d script - which prints in terms of I/O wait time, not bytes.
I/O wait time is a better metric for understanding performance issues.
Both disk and NFS I/O are measured.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

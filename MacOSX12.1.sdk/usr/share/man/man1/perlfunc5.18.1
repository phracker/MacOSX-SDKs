.IX Xref "function"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The functions in this section can serve as terms in an expression.
They fall into two major categories: list operators and named unary
operators.  These differ in their precedence relationship with a
following comma.  (See the precedence table in perlop.)  List
operators take more than one argument, while unary operators can never
take more than one argument.  Thus, a comma terminates the argument of
a unary operator, but merely separates the arguments of a list
operator.  A unary operator generally provides scalar context to its
argument, while a list operator may provide either scalar or list
contexts for its arguments.  If it does both, scalar arguments 
come first and list argument follow, and there can only ever
be one such list argument.  For instance, \fIsplice()\fR has three scalar
arguments followed by a list, whereas \fIgethostbyname()\fR has four scalar
arguments.
.PP
In the syntax descriptions that follow, list operators that expect a
list (and provide list context for elements of the list) are shown
with \s-1LIST\s0 as an argument.  Such a list may consist of any combination
of scalar arguments or list values; the list values will be included
in the list as if each individual element were interpolated at that
point in the list, forming a longer single-dimensional list value.
Commas should separate literal elements of the \s-1LIST.\s0
.PP
Any function in the list below may be used either with or without
parentheses around its arguments.  (The syntax descriptions omit the
parentheses.)  If you use parentheses, the simple but occasionally 
surprising rule is this: It \fIlooks\fR like a function, therefore it \fIis\fR a
function, and precedence doesn't matter.  Otherwise it's a list
operator or unary operator, and precedence does matter.  Whitespace
between the function and left parenthesis doesn't count, so sometimes
you need to be careful:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    print 1+2+4;      # Prints 7.
\&    print(1+2) + 4;   # Prints 3.
\&    print (1+2)+4;    # Also prints 3!
\&    print +(1+2)+4;   # Prints 7.
\&    print ((1+2)+4);  # Prints 7.
.Ve
.PP
If you run Perl with the \fB\-w\fR switch it can warn you about this.  For
example, the third line above produces:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    print (...) interpreted as function at \- line 1.
\&    Useless use of integer addition in void context at \- line 1.
.Ve
.PP
A few functions take no arguments at all, and therefore work as neither
unary nor list operators.  These include such functions as \f(CW\*(C`time\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`endpwent\*(C'\fR.  For example, \f(CW\*(C`time+86_400\*(C'\fR always means
\&\f(CW\*(C`time() + 86_400\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For functions that can be used in either a scalar or list context,
nonabortive failure is generally indicated in scalar context by
returning the undefined value, and in list context by returning the
empty list.
.PP
Remember the following important rule: There is \fBno rule\fR that relates
the behavior of an expression in list context to its behavior in scalar
context, or vice versa.  It might do two totally different things.
Each operator and function decides which sort of value would be most
appropriate to return in scalar context.  Some operators return the
length of the list that would have been returned in list context.  Some
operators return the first value in the list.  Some operators return the
last value in the list.  Some operators return a count of successful
operations.  In general, they do what you want, unless you want
consistency.
.IX Xref "context"
.PP
A named array in scalar context is quite different from what would at
first glance appear to be a list in scalar context.  You can't get a list
like \f(CW\*(C`(1,2,3)\*(C'\fR into being in scalar context, because the compiler knows
the context at compile time.  It would generate the scalar comma operator
there, not the list construction version of the comma.  That means it
was never a list to start with.
.PP
In general, functions in Perl that serve as wrappers for system calls (\*(L"syscalls\*(R")
of the same name (like \fIchown\fR\|(2), \fIfork\fR\|(2), \fIclosedir\fR\|(2), etc.) return
true when they succeed and \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR otherwise, as is usually mentioned
in the descriptions below.  This is different from the C interfaces,
which return \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR on failure.  Exceptions to this rule include \f(CW\*(C`wait\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`waitpid\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`syscall\*(C'\fR.  System calls also set the special \f(CW$!\fR
variable on failure.  Other functions do not, except accidentally.
.PP
Extension modules can also hook into the Perl parser to define new
kinds of keyword-headed expression.  These may look like functions, but
may also look completely different.  The syntax following the keyword
is defined entirely by the extension.  If you are an implementor, see
\&\*(L"PL_keyword_plugin\*(R" in perlapi for the mechanism.  If you are using such
a module, see the module's documentation for details of the syntax that
it defines.

A file test, where X is one of the letters listed below.  This unary
operator takes one argument, either a filename, a filehandle, or a dirhandle, 
and tests the associated file to see if something is true about it.  If the
argument is omitted, tests \f(CW$_\fR, except for \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR, which tests \s-1STDIN.\s0
Unless otherwise documented, it returns \f(CW1\fR for true and \f(CW\*(Aq\*(Aq\fR for false, or
the undefined value if the file doesn't exist.  Despite the funny
names, precedence is the same as any other named unary operator.  The
operator may be any of:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    \-r  File is readable by effective uid/gid.
\&    \-w  File is writable by effective uid/gid.
\&    \-x  File is executable by effective uid/gid.
\&    \-o  File is owned by effective uid.
\&
\&    \-R  File is readable by real uid/gid.
\&    \-W  File is writable by real uid/gid.
\&    \-X  File is executable by real uid/gid.
\&    \-O  File is owned by real uid.
\&
\&    \-e  File exists.
\&    \-z  File has zero size (is empty).
\&    \-s  File has nonzero size (returns size in bytes).
\&
\&    \-f  File is a plain file.
\&    \-d  File is a directory.
\&    \-l  File is a symbolic link.
\&    \-p  File is a named pipe (FIFO), or Filehandle is a pipe.
\&    \-S  File is a socket.
\&    \-b  File is a block special file.
\&    \-c  File is a character special file.
\&    \-t  Filehandle is opened to a tty.

\&    \-B  File is a "binary" file (opposite of \-T).
\&
\&    \-M  Script start time minus file modification time, in days.
\&    \-A  Same for access time.
\&    \-C  Same for inode change time (Unix, may differ for other

Note that \f(CW\*(C`\-s/a/b/\*(C'\fR does not do a negated substitution.  Saying
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-exp($foo)\*(C'\fR still works as expected, however: only single letters
following a minus are interpreted as file tests.
.Sp
These operators are exempt from the \*(L"looks like a function rule\*(R" described
above.  That is, an opening parenthesis after the operator does not affect
how much of the following code constitutes the argument.  Put the opening
parentheses before the operator to separate it from code that follows (this
applies only to operators with higher precedence than unary operators, of
course):
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    \-s($file) + 1024   # probably wrong; same as \-s($file + 1024)
\&    (\-s $file) + 1024  # correct

.Sp
The interpretation of the file permission operators \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-R\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-w\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-W\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-x\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`\-X\*(C'\fR is by default based solely on the mode
of the file and the uids and gids of the user.  There may be other
reasons you can't actually read, write, or execute the file: for
example network filesystem access controls, ACLs (access control lists),
read-only filesystems, and unrecognized executable formats.  Note
that the use of these six specific operators to verify if some operation
is possible is usually a mistake, because it may be open to race
conditions.
.Sp
Also note that, for the superuser on the local filesystems, the \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-R\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-w\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`\-W\*(C'\fR tests always return 1, and \f(CW\*(C`\-x\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-X\*(C'\fR return 1
if any execute bit is set in the mode.  Scripts run by the superuser
may thus need to do a \fIstat()\fR to determine the actual mode of the file,
or temporarily set their effective uid to something else.
.Sp
If you are using ACLs, there is a pragma called \f(CW\*(C`filetest\*(C'\fR that may
produce more accurate results than the bare \fIstat()\fR mode bits.
When under \f(CW\*(C`use filetest \*(Aqaccess\*(Aq\*(C'\fR the above-mentioned filetests
test whether the permission can(not) be granted using the
\&\fIaccess\fR\|(2) family of system calls.  Also note that the \f(CW\*(C`\-x\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-X\*(C'\fR may
under this pragma return true even if there are no execute permission
bits set (nor any extra execute permission ACLs).  This strangeness is
due to the underlying system calls' definitions.  Note also that, due to
the implementation of \f(CW\*(C`use filetest \*(Aqaccess\*(Aq\*(C'\fR, the \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR special
filehandle won't cache the results of the file tests when this pragma is
in effect.  Read the documentation for the \f(CW\*(C`filetest\*(C'\fR pragma for more
information.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-B\*(C'\fR switches work as follows.  The first block or so of the
file is examined for odd characters such as strange control codes or
characters with the high bit set.  If too many strange characters (>30%)
are found, it's a \f(CW\*(C`\-B\*(C'\fR file; otherwise it's a \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR file.  Also, any file
containing a zero byte in the first block is considered a binary file.  If \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`\-B\*(C'\fR is used on a filehandle, the current \s-1IO\s0 buffer is examined
rather than the first block.  Both \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-B\*(C'\fR return true on an empty
file, or a file at \s-1EOF\s0 when testing a filehandle.  Because you have to
read a file to do the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR test, on most occasions you want to use a \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR
against the file first, as in \f(CW\*(C`next unless \-f $file && \-T $file\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If any of the file tests (or either the \f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`lstat\*(C'\fR operator) is given
the special filehandle consisting of a solitary underline, then the stat
structure of the previous file test (or stat operator) is used, saving
a system call.  (This doesn't work with \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR, and you need to remember
that \fIlstat()\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-l\*(C'\fR leave values in the stat structure for the
symbolic link, not the real file.)  (Also, if the stat buffer was filled by
an \f(CW\*(C`lstat\*(C'\fR call, \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-B\*(C'\fR will reset it with the results of \f(CW\*(C`stat _\*(C'\fR).
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print "Can do.\en" if \-r $a || \-w _ || \-x _;
\&
\&    stat($filename);
\&    print "Readable\en" if \-r _;
\&    print "Writable\en" if \-w _;
\&    print "Executable\en" if \-x _;
\&    print "Setuid\en" if \-u _;
\&    print "Setgid\en" if \-g _;
\&    print "Sticky\en" if \-k _;
\&    print "Text\en" if \-T _;
\&    print "Binary\en" if \-B _;
.Ve
.Sp
As of Perl 5.10.0, as a form of purely syntactic sugar, you can stack file
test operators, in a way that \f(CW\*(C`\-f \-w \-x $file\*(C'\fR is equivalent to
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-x $file && \-w _ && \-f _\*(C'\fR.  (This is only fancy fancy: if you use
the return value of \f(CW\*(C`\-f $file\*(C'\fR as an argument to another filetest
operator, no special magic will happen.)

be set for the newly opened file descriptor, as determined by the
value of $^F.  See \*(L"$^F\*(R" in perlvar.

.IP "alarm" 4
.IX Item "alarm"
.PD
Arranges to have a \s-1SIGALRM\s0 delivered to this process after the
specified number of wallclock seconds has elapsed.  If \s-1SECONDS\s0 is not
specified, the value stored in \f(CW$_\fR is used.  (On some machines,
unfortunately, the elapsed time may be up to one second less or more
than you specified because of how seconds are counted, and process
scheduling may delay the delivery of the signal even further.)
.Sp
Only one timer may be counting at once.  Each call disables the
previous timer, and an argument of \f(CW0\fR may be supplied to cancel the
previous timer without starting a new one.  The returned value is the
amount of time remaining on the previous timer.
.Sp
For delays of finer granularity than one second, the Time::HiRes module
(from \s-1CPAN,\s0 and starting from Perl 5.8 part of the standard
distribution) provides \fIualarm()\fR.  You may also use Perl's four-argument
version of \fIselect()\fR leaving the first three arguments undefined, or you
might be able to use the \f(CW\*(C`syscall\*(C'\fR interface to access \fIsetitimer\fR\|(2) if
your system supports it.  See perlfaq8 for details.
.Sp
It is usually a mistake to intermix \f(CW\*(C`alarm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`sleep\*(C'\fR calls, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`sleep\*(C'\fR may be internally implemented on your system with \f(CW\*(C`alarm\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If you want to use \f(CW\*(C`alarm\*(C'\fR to time out a system call you need to use an
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR pair.  You can't rely on the alarm causing the system call to
fail with \f(CW$!\fR set to \f(CW\*(C`EINTR\*(C'\fR because Perl sets up signal handlers to
restart system calls on some systems.  Using \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR always works,
modulo the caveats given in \*(L"Signals\*(R" in perlipc.

Arranges for \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 to be read or written in \*(L"binary\*(R" or \*(L"text\*(R"
mode on systems where the run-time libraries distinguish between
binary and text files.  If \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 is an expression, the value is
taken as the name of the filehandle.  Returns true on success,
otherwise it returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR and sets \f(CW$!\fR (errno).
.Sp
On some systems (in general, \s-1DOS\-\s0 and Windows-based systems) \fIbinmode()\fR
is necessary when you're not working with a text file.  For the sake
of portability it is a good idea always to use it when appropriate,
and never to use it when it isn't appropriate.  Also, people can
set their I/O to be by default UTF8\-encoded Unicode, not bytes.
.Sp
In other words: regardless of platform, use \fIbinmode()\fR on binary data,
like images, for example.
.Sp
If \s-1LAYER\s0 is present it is a single string, but may contain multiple
directives.  The directives alter the behaviour of the filehandle.
When \s-1LAYER\s0 is present, using binmode on a text file makes sense.
.Sp
If \s-1LAYER\s0 is omitted or specified as \f(CW\*(C`:raw\*(C'\fR the filehandle is made
suitable for passing binary data.  This includes turning off possible \s-1CRLF\s0
translation and marking it as bytes (as opposed to Unicode characters).
Note that, despite what may be implied in \fI\*(L"Programming Perl\*(R"\fR (the
Camel, 3rd edition) or elsewhere, \f(CW\*(C`:raw\*(C'\fR is \fInot\fR simply the inverse of \f(CW\*(C`:crlf\*(C'\fR.
Other layers that would affect the binary nature of the stream are
\&\fIalso\fR disabled.  See PerlIO, perlrun, and the discussion about the
\&\s-1PERLIO\s0 environment variable.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`:bytes\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`:crlf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR, and any other directives of the
form \f(CW\*(C`:...\*(C'\fR, are called I/O \fIlayers\fR.  The \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR pragma can be used to
establish default I/O layers.  See open.
.Sp
\&\fIThe \s-1LAYER\s0 parameter of the \fIbinmode()\fI function is described as \*(L"\s-1DISCIPLINE\*(R"\s0
in \*(L"Programming Perl, 3rd Edition\*(R".  However, since the publishing of this
book, by many known as \*(L"Camel \s-1III\*(R",\s0 the consensus of the naming of this
functionality has moved from \*(L"discipline\*(R" to \*(L"layer\*(R".  All documentation
of this version of Perl therefore refers to \*(L"layers\*(R" rather than to
\&\*(L"disciplines\*(R".  Now back to the regularly scheduled documentation...\fR
.Sp
To mark \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 as \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 use \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`:encoding(UTF\-8)\*(C'\fR.
\&\f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR just marks the data as \s-1UTF\-8\s0 without further checking,
while \f(CW\*(C`:encoding(UTF\-8)\*(C'\fR checks the data for actually being valid
\&\s-1UTF\-8. \s0 More details can be found in PerlIO::encoding.
.Sp
In general, \fIbinmode()\fR should be called after \fIopen()\fR but before any I/O
is done on the filehandle.  Calling \fIbinmode()\fR normally flushes any
pending buffered output data (and perhaps pending input data) on the
handle.  An exception to this is the \f(CW\*(C`:encoding\*(C'\fR layer that
changes the default character encoding of the handle; see \*(L"open\*(R".
The \f(CW\*(C`:encoding\*(C'\fR layer sometimes needs to be called in
mid-stream, and it doesn't flush the stream.  The \f(CW\*(C`:encoding\*(C'\fR
also implicitly pushes on top of itself the \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR layer because
internally Perl operates on UTF8\-encoded Unicode characters.
.Sp
The operating system, device drivers, C libraries, and Perl run-time
system all conspire to let the programmer treat a single
character (\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR) as the line terminator, irrespective of external
representation.  On many operating systems, the native text file
representation matches the internal representation, but on some
platforms the external representation of \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR is made up of more than
one character.
.Sp
All variants of Unix, Mac \s-1OS \s0(old and new), and Stream_LF files on \s-1VMS\s0 use
a single character to end each line in the external representation of text
(even though that single character is \s-1CARRIAGE RETURN\s0 on old, pre-Darwin
flavors of Mac \s-1OS,\s0 and is \s-1LINE FEED\s0 on Unix and most \s-1VMS\s0 files).  In other
systems like \s-1OS/2, DOS,\s0 and the various flavors of MS-Windows, your program
sees a \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR as a simple \f(CW\*(C`\ecJ\*(C'\fR, but what's stored in text files are the
two characters \f(CW\*(C`\ecM\ecJ\*(C'\fR.  That means that if you don't use \fIbinmode()\fR on
these systems, \f(CW\*(C`\ecM\ecJ\*(C'\fR sequences on disk will be converted to \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR on
input, and any \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR in your program will be converted back to \f(CW\*(C`\ecM\ecJ\*(C'\fR on
output.  This is what you want for text files, but it can be disastrous for
binary files.
.Sp
Another consequence of using \fIbinmode()\fR (on some systems) is that
special end-of-file markers will be seen as part of the data stream.
For systems from the Microsoft family this means that, if your binary
data contain \f(CW\*(C`\ecZ\*(C'\fR, the I/O subsystem will regard it as the end of
the file, unless you use \fIbinmode()\fR.
.Sp
\&\fIbinmode()\fR is important not only for \fIreadline()\fR and \fIprint()\fR operations,
but also when using \fIread()\fR, \fIseek()\fR, \fIsysread()\fR, \fIsyswrite()\fR and \fItell()\fR
(see perlport for more details).  See the \f(CW$/\fR and \f(CW\*(C`$\e\*(C'\fR variables
in perlvar for how to manually set your input and output
line-termination sequences.

Here \f(CW$subroutine\fR may be \f(CW\*(C`(eval)\*(C'\fR if the frame is not a subroutine
call, but an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR.  In such a case additional elements \f(CW$evaltext\fR and
\&\f(CW$is_require\fR are set: \f(CW$is_require\fR is true if the frame is created by a
\&\f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR statement, \f(CW$evaltext\fR contains the text of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval EXPR\*(C'\fR statement.  In particular, for an \f(CW\*(C`eval BLOCK\*(C'\fR statement,
\&\f(CW$subroutine\fR is \f(CW\*(C`(eval)\*(C'\fR, but \f(CW$evaltext\fR is undefined.  (Note also that
each \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR statement creates a \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR frame inside an \f(CW\*(C`eval EXPR\*(C'\fR
frame.)  \f(CW$subroutine\fR may also be \f(CW\*(C`(unknown)\*(C'\fR if this particular
subroutine happens to have been deleted from the symbol table.
\&\f(CW$hasargs\fR is true if a new instance of \f(CW@_\fR was set up for the frame.
\&\f(CW$hints\fR and \f(CW$bitmask\fR contain pragmatic hints that the caller was
compiled with.  \f(CW$hints\fR corresponds to \f(CW$^H\fR, and \f(CW$bitmask\fR
corresponds to \f(CW\*(C`${^WARNING_BITS}\*(C'\fR.  The
\&\f(CW$hints\fR and \f(CW$bitmask\fR values are subject
to change between versions of Perl, and are not meant for external use.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$hinthash\fR is a reference to a hash containing the value of \f(CW\*(C`%^H\*(C'\fR when the
caller was compiled, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`%^H\*(C'\fR was empty.  Do not modify the values
of this hash, as they are the actual values stored in the optree.
.Sp
Furthermore, when called from within the \s-1DB\s0 package in
list context, and with an argument, caller returns more
detailed information: it sets the list variable \f(CW@DB::args\fR to be the
arguments with which the subroutine was invoked.
.Sp
Be aware that the optimizer might have optimized call frames away before
\&\f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR had a chance to get the information.  That means that \f(CWcaller(N)\fR
might not return information about the call frame you expect it to, for
\&\f(CW\*(C`N > 1\*(C'\fR.  In particular, \f(CW@DB::args\fR might have information from the
previous time \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR was called.
.Sp
Be aware that setting \f(CW@DB::args\fR is \fIbest effort\fR, intended for
debugging or generating backtraces, and should not be relied upon.  In
particular, as \f(CW@_\fR contains aliases to the caller's arguments, Perl does
not take a copy of \f(CW@_\fR, so \f(CW@DB::args\fR will contain modifications the
subroutine makes to \f(CW@_\fR or its contents, not the original values at call
time.  \f(CW@DB::args\fR, like \f(CW@_\fR, does not hold explicit references to its
elements, so under certain cases its elements may have become freed and
reallocated for other variables or temporary values.  Finally, a side effect
of the current implementation is that the effects of \f(CW\*(C`shift @_\*(C'\fR can
\&\fInormally\fR be undone (but not \f(CW\*(C`pop @_\*(C'\fR or other splicing, \fIand\fR not if a
reference to \f(CW@_\fR has been taken, \fIand\fR subject to the caveat about reallocated
elements), so \f(CW@DB::args\fR is actually a hybrid of the current state and
initial state of \f(CW@_\fR.  Buyer beware.

remove the newline from the end of an input record when you're worried

If the filehandle came from a piped open, \f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR returns false if one of
the other syscalls involved fails or if its program exits with non-zero
status.  If the only problem was that the program exited non-zero, \f(CW$!\fR

When followed by a \s-1BLOCK, \s0\f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR is actually a
flow control statement rather than a function.  If
there is a \f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR \s-1BLOCK\s0 attached to a \s-1BLOCK \s0(typically in a \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR), it is always executed just before the conditional is about to
be evaluated again, just like the third part of a \f(CW\*(C`for\*(C'\fR loop in C.  Thus
it can be used to increment a loop variable, even when the loop has been
continued via the \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR statement (which is similar to the C \f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR
statement).
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`redo\*(C'\fR may appear within a \f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR
block; \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`redo\*(C'\fR behave as if they had been executed within
the main block.  So will \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR, but since it will execute a \f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR
block, it may be more entertaining.
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    while (EXPR) {
\&        ### redo always comes here
\&        do_something;
\&    } continue {
\&        ### next always comes here
\&        do_something_else;
\&        # then back the top to re\-check EXPR
\&    }
\&    ### last always comes here
.Ve
.Sp
Omitting the \f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR section is equivalent to using an
empty one, logically enough, so \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR goes directly back
to check the condition at the top of the loop.
.Sp
When there is no \s-1BLOCK, \s0\f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR is a function that
falls through the current \f(CW\*(C`when\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR block instead of iterating
a dynamically enclosing \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR or exiting a lexically enclosing \f(CW\*(C`given\*(C'\fR.
In Perl 5.14 and earlier, this form of \f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR was
only available when the \f(CW"switch"\fR feature was enabled.

.IP "crypt \s-1PLAINTEXT,SALT \s0" 4
.IX Xref "crypt digest hash salt plaintext password decrypt cryptography passwd encrypt"
.IX Item "crypt PLAINTEXT,SALT "
Creates a digest string exactly like the \fIcrypt\fR\|(3) function in the C
library (assuming that you actually have a version there that has not
been extirpated as a potential munition).
.Sp
\&\fIcrypt()\fR is a one-way hash function.  The \s-1PLAINTEXT\s0 and \s-1SALT\s0 are turned
into a short string, called a digest, which is returned.  The same
\&\s-1PLAINTEXT\s0 and \s-1SALT\s0 will always return the same string, but there is no
(known) way to get the original \s-1PLAINTEXT\s0 from the hash.  Small
changes in the \s-1PLAINTEXT\s0 or \s-1SALT\s0 will result in large changes in the
digest.
.Sp
There is no decrypt function.  This function isn't all that useful for
cryptography (for that, look for \fICrypt\fR modules on your nearby \s-1CPAN\s0
mirror) and the name \*(L"crypt\*(R" is a bit of a misnomer.  Instead it is
primarily used to check if two pieces of text are the same without
having to transmit or store the text itself.  An example is checking
if a correct password is given.  The digest of the password is stored,
not the password itself.  The user types in a password that is
\&\fIcrypt()\fR'd with the same salt as the stored digest.  If the two digests
match, the password is correct.
.Sp
When verifying an existing digest string you should use the digest as
the salt (like \f(CW\*(C`crypt($plain, $digest) eq $digest\*(C'\fR).  The \s-1SALT\s0 used
to create the digest is visible as part of the digest.  This ensures
\&\fIcrypt()\fR will hash the new string with the same salt as the digest.
This allows your code to work with the standard crypt and
with more exotic implementations.  In other words, assume
nothing about the returned string itself nor about how many bytes 
of \s-1SALT\s0 may matter.
.Sp
Traditionally the result is a string of 13 bytes: two first bytes of
the salt, followed by 11 bytes from the set \f(CW\*(C`[./0\-9A\-Za\-z]\*(C'\fR, and only
the first eight bytes of \s-1PLAINTEXT\s0 mattered.  But alternative
hashing schemes (like \s-1MD5\s0), higher level security schemes (like C2),
and implementations on non-Unix platforms may produce different
strings.
.Sp
When choosing a new salt create a random two character string whose
characters come from the set \f(CW\*(C`[./0\-9A\-Za\-z]\*(C'\fR (like \f(CW\*(C`join \*(Aq\*(Aq, (\*(Aq.\*(Aq,
\&\*(Aq/\*(Aq, 0..9, \*(AqA\*(Aq..\*(AqZ\*(Aq, \*(Aqa\*(Aq..\*(Aqz\*(Aq)[rand 64, rand 64]\*(C'\fR).  This set of
characters is just a recommendation; the characters allowed in
the salt depend solely on your system's crypt library, and Perl can't
restrict what salts \f(CW\*(C`crypt()\*(C'\fR accepts.
.Sp
Here's an example that makes sure that whoever runs this program knows
their password:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $pwd = (getpwuid($<))[1];
\&
\&    system "stty \-echo";
\&    print "Password: ";
\&    chomp($word = <STDIN>);
\&    print "\en";
\&    system "stty echo";
\&
\&    if (crypt($word, $pwd) ne $pwd) {
\&        die "Sorry...\en";
\&    } else {
\&        print "ok\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Of course, typing in your own password to whoever asks you
for it is unwise.
.Sp
The crypt function is unsuitable for hashing large quantities
of data, not least of all because you can't get the information
back.  Look at the Digest module for more robust algorithms.
.Sp
If using \fIcrypt()\fR on a Unicode string (which \fIpotentially\fR has
characters with codepoints above 255), Perl tries to make sense
of the situation by trying to downgrade (a copy of)
the string back to an eight-bit byte string before calling \fIcrypt()\fR
(on that copy).  If that works, good.  If not, \fIcrypt()\fR dies with
\&\f(CW\*(C`Wide character in crypt\*(C'\fR.

This binds a \fIdbm\fR\|(3), \fIndbm\fR\|(3), \fIsdbm\fR\|(3), \fIgdbm\fR\|(3), or Berkeley \s-1DB\s0 file to a
hash.  \s-1HASH\s0 is the name of the hash.  (Unlike normal \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR, the first
argument is \fInot\fR a filehandle, even though it looks like one).  \s-1DBNAME\s0
is the name of the database (without the \fI.dir\fR or \fI.pag\fR extension if
any).  If the database does not exist, it is created with protection
specified by \s-1MASK \s0(as modified by the \f(CW\*(C`umask\*(C'\fR).  To prevent creation of
the database if it doesn't exist, you may specify a \s-1MODE\s0
of 0, and the function will return a false value if it
can't find an existing database.  If your system supports
only the older \s-1DBM\s0 functions, you may make only one \f(CW\*(C`dbmopen\*(C'\fR call in your
program.  In older versions of Perl, if your system had neither \s-1DBM\s0 nor
ndbm, calling \f(CW\*(C`dbmopen\*(C'\fR produced a fatal error; it now falls back to
\&\fIsdbm\fR\|(3).
.Sp
If you don't have write access to the \s-1DBM\s0 file, you can only read hash
variables, not set them.  If you want to test whether you can write,
either use file tests or try setting a dummy hash entry inside an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR 
to trap the error.
.Sp
Note that functions such as \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR may return huge lists
when used on large \s-1DBM\s0 files.  You may prefer to use the \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR
function to iterate over large \s-1DBM\s0 files.  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    # print out history file offsets
\&    dbmopen(%HIST,\*(Aq/usr/lib/news/history\*(Aq,0666);
\&    while (($key,$val) = each %HIST) {
\&        print $key, \*(Aq = \*(Aq, unpack(\*(AqL\*(Aq,$val), "\en";

Returns a Boolean value telling whether \s-1EXPR\s0 has a value other than
the undefined value \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.  If \s-1EXPR\s0 is not present, \f(CW$_\fR is
checked.
.Sp
Many operations return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR to indicate failure, end of file,
system error, uninitialized variable, and other exceptional
conditions.  This function allows you to distinguish \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR from
other values.  (A simple Boolean test will not distinguish among
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, zero, the empty string, and \f(CW"0"\fR, which are all equally
false.)  Note that since \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is a valid scalar, its presence
doesn't \fInecessarily\fR indicate an exceptional condition: \f(CW\*(C`pop\*(C'\fR
returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR when its argument is an empty array, \fIor\fR when the
element to return happens to be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
You may also use \f(CW\*(C`defined(&func)\*(C'\fR to check whether subroutine \f(CW&func\fR
has ever been defined.  The return value is unaffected by any forward
declarations of \f(CW&func\fR.  A subroutine that is not defined
may still be callable: its package may have an \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR method that
makes it spring into existence the first time that it is called; see
perlsub.
.Sp
Use of \f(CW\*(C`defined\*(C'\fR on aggregates (hashes and arrays) is deprecated.  It
used to report whether memory for that aggregate had ever been
allocated.  This behavior may disappear in future versions of Perl.
You should instead use a simple test for size:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    if (@an_array) { print "has array elements\en" }
\&    if (%a_hash)   { print "has hash members\en"   }
.Ve
.Sp
When used on a hash element, it tells you whether the value is defined,
not whether the key exists in the hash.  Use \*(L"exists\*(R" for the latter
purpose.
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    print if defined $switch{D};
\&    print "$val\en" while defined($val = pop(@ary));
\&    die "Can\*(Aqt readlink $sym: $!"
\&        unless defined($value = readlink $sym);
\&    sub foo { defined &$bar ? &$bar(@_) : die "No bar"; }
\&    $debugging = 0 unless defined $debugging;
.Ve
.Sp
Note:  Many folks tend to overuse \f(CW\*(C`defined\*(C'\fR and are then surprised to
discover that the number \f(CW0\fR and \f(CW""\fR (the zero-length string) are, in fact,
defined values.  For example, if you say
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    "ab" =~ /a(.*)b/;
.Ve
.Sp
The pattern match succeeds and \f(CW$1\fR is defined, although it
matched \*(L"nothing\*(R".  It didn't really fail to match anything.  Rather, it
matched something that happened to be zero characters long.  This is all
very above-board and honest.  When a function returns an undefined value,
it's an admission that it couldn't give you an honest answer.  So you
should use \f(CW\*(C`defined\*(C'\fR only when questioning the integrity of what
you're trying to do.  At other times, a simple comparison to \f(CW0\fR or \f(CW""\fR is
what you want.
.Sp

.IP "delete \s-1EXPR \s0" 4
.IX Xref "delete"
.IX Item "delete EXPR "
Given an expression that specifies an element or slice of a hash, \f(CW\*(C`delete\*(C'\fR
deletes the specified elements from that hash so that \fIexists()\fR on that element
no longer returns true.  Setting a hash element to the undefined value does
not remove its key, but deleting it does; see \*(L"exists\*(R".
.Sp
In list context, returns the value or values deleted, or the last such
element in scalar context.  The return list's length always matches that of
the argument list: deleting non-existent elements returns the undefined value
in their corresponding positions.
.Sp
\&\fIdelete()\fR may also be used on arrays and array slices, but its behavior is less
straightforward.  Although \fIexists()\fR will return false for deleted entries,
deleting array elements never changes indices of existing values; use \fIshift()\fR
or \fIsplice()\fR for that.  However, if all deleted elements fall at the end of an
array, the array's size shrinks to the position of the highest element that
still tests true for \fIexists()\fR, or to 0 if none do.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1WARNING:\s0\fR Calling delete on array values is deprecated and likely to
be removed in a future version of Perl.
.Sp
Deleting from \f(CW%ENV\fR modifies the environment.  Deleting from a hash tied to
a \s-1DBM\s0 file deletes the entry from the \s-1DBM\s0 file.  Deleting from a \f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR hash
or array may not necessarily return anything; it depends on the implementation
of the \f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR package's \s-1DELETE\s0 method, which may do whatever it pleases.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`delete local EXPR\*(C'\fR construct localizes the deletion to the current
block at run time.  Until the block exits, elements locally deleted
temporarily no longer exist.  See \*(L"Localized deletion of elements
of composite types\*(R" in perlsub.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    %hash = (foo => 11, bar => 22, baz => 33);
\&    $scalar = delete $hash{foo};         # $scalar is 11

\&    @array  = delete @hash{qw(foo baz)}; # @array  is (undef,33)

\&    }
\&
\&    foreach $index (0 .. $#ARRAY) {

.Sp
And so do these:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    delete @HASH{keys %HASH};
\&
\&    delete @ARRAY[0 .. $#ARRAY];
.Ve
.Sp
But both are slower than assigning the empty list
or undefining \f(CW%HASH\fR or \f(CW@ARRAY\fR, which is the customary 
way to empty out an aggregate:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    %HASH = ();     # completely empty %HASH
\&    undef %HASH;    # forget %HASH ever existed
\&
\&    @ARRAY = ();    # completely empty @ARRAY

.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1EXPR\s0 can be arbitrarily complicated provided its
final operation is an element or slice of an aggregate:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    delete $ref\->[$x][$y]{$key};
\&    delete @{$ref\->[$x][$y]}{$key1, $key2, @morekeys};

\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR raises an exception.  Inside an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR the error message is stuffed

If the exception is outside of all enclosing \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fRs, then the uncaught
exception prints \s-1LIST\s0 to \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR and exits with a non-zero value.  If you
need to exit the process with a specific exit code, see \*(L"exit\*(R".

.Ve
.Sp
If the last element of \s-1LIST\s0 does not end in a newline, the current
script line number and input line number (if any) are also printed,
and a newline is supplied.  Note that the \*(L"input line number\*(R" (also
known as \*(L"chunk\*(R") is subject to whatever notion of \*(L"line\*(R" happens to
be currently in effect, and is also available as the special variable
\&\f(CW$.\fR.  See \*(L"$/\*(R" in perlvar and \*(L"$.\*(R" in perlvar.
.Sp
Hint: sometimes appending \f(CW", stopped"\fR to your message will cause it
to make better sense when the string \f(CW"at foo line 123"\fR is appended.
Suppose you are running script \*(L"canasta\*(R".

.Ve
.Sp
If the output is empty and \f(CW$@\fR already contains a value (typically from a
previous eval) that value is reused after appending \f(CW"\et...propagated"\fR.
This is useful for propagating exceptions:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    eval { ... };
\&    die unless $@ =~ /Expected exception/;
.Ve
.Sp
If the output is empty and \f(CW$@\fR contains an object reference that has a
\&\f(CW\*(C`PROPAGATE\*(C'\fR method, that method will be called with additional file
and line number parameters.  The return value replaces the value in
\&\f(CW$@\fR;  i.e., as if \f(CW\*(C`$@ = eval { $@\->PROPAGATE(_\|_FILE_\|_, _\|_LINE_\|_) };\*(C'\fR
were called.
.Sp
If \f(CW$@\fR is empty then the string \f(CW"Died"\fR is used.
.Sp
If an uncaught exception results in interpreter exit, the exit code is
determined from the values of \f(CW$!\fR and \f(CW$?\fR with this pseudocode:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    exit $! if $!;              # errno
\&    exit $? >> 8 if $? >> 8;    # child exit status
\&    exit 255;                   # last resort
.Ve
.Sp
The intent is to squeeze as much possible information about the likely cause
into the limited space of the system exit
code.  However, as \f(CW$!\fR is the value
of C's \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR, which can be set by any system call, this means that the value
of the exit code used by \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR can be non-predictable, so should not be relied
upon, other than to be non-zero.
.Sp
You can also call \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR with a reference argument, and if this is trapped
within an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR, \f(CW$@\fR contains that reference.  This permits more
elaborate exception handling using objects that maintain arbitrary state
about the exception.  Such a scheme is sometimes preferable to matching
particular string values of \f(CW$@\fR with regular expressions.  Because \f(CW$@\fR 
is a global variable and \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR may be used within object implementations,
be careful that analyzing the error object doesn't replace the reference in
the global variable.  It's easiest to make a local copy of the reference
before any manipulations.  Here's an example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use Scalar::Util "blessed";
\&
\&    eval { ... ; die Some::Module::Exception\->new( FOO => "bar" ) };
\&    if (my $ev_err = $@) {
\&        if (blessed($ev_err)
\&            && $ev_err\->isa("Some::Module::Exception")) {
\&            # handle Some::Module::Exception
\&        }
\&        else {
\&            # handle all other possible exceptions
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Because Perl stringifies uncaught exception messages before display,
you'll probably want to overload stringification operations on
exception objects.  See overload for details about that.
.Sp
You can arrange for a callback to be run just before the \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR
does its deed, by setting the \f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR hook.  The associated
handler is called with the error text and can change the error
message, if it sees fit, by calling \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR again.  See
\&\*(L"%SIG\*(R" in perlvar for details on setting \f(CW%SIG\fR entries, and
\&\*(L"eval \s-1BLOCK\*(R"\s0 for some examples.  Although this feature was 
to be run only right before your program was to exit, this is not
currently so: the \f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR hook is currently called
even inside \fIeval()\fRed blocks/strings!  If one wants the hook to do
nothing in such situations, put
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    die @_ if $^S;
.Ve
.Sp
as the first line of the handler (see \*(L"$^S\*(R" in perlvar).  Because
this promotes strange action at a distance, this counterintuitive
behavior may be fixed in a future release.

\&\f(CW%INC\fR if the file is found.  See \*(L"@INC\*(R" in perlvar and \*(L"%INC\*(R" in perlvar for
these variables.  It also differs in that code evaluated with \f(CW\*(C`do FILENAME\*(C'\fR
cannot see lexicals in the enclosing scope; \f(CW\*(C`eval STRING\*(C'\fR does.  It's the
same, however, in that it does reparse the file every time you call it,
so you probably don't want to do this inside a loop.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR can read the file but cannot compile it, it returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR and sets
an error message in \f(CW$@\fR.  If \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR cannot read the file, it returns undef
and sets \f(CW$!\fR to the error.  Always check \f(CW$@\fR first, as compilation
could fail in a way that also sets \f(CW$!\fR.  If the file is successfully
compiled, \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR returns the value of the last expression evaluated.
.Sp
Inclusion of library modules is better done with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR operators, which also do automatic error checking
and raise an exception if there's a problem.
.Sp
You might like to use \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR to read in a program configuration
file.  Manual error checking can be done this way:

This function causes an immediate core dump.  See also the \fB\-u\fR
command-line switch in perlrun, which does the same thing.
Primarily this is so that you can use the \fBundump\fR program (not
supplied) to turn your core dump into an executable binary after
having initialized all your variables at the beginning of the
program.  When the new binary is executed it will begin by executing
a \f(CW\*(C`goto LABEL\*(C'\fR (with all the restrictions that \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR suffers).
Think of it as a goto with an intervening core dump and reincarnation.
If \f(CW\*(C`LABEL\*(C'\fR is omitted, restarts the program from the top.  The
\&\f(CW\*(C`dump EXPR\*(C'\fR form, available starting in Perl 5.18.0, allows a name to be
computed at run time, being otherwise identical to \f(CW\*(C`dump LABEL\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: Any files opened at the time of the dump will \fInot\fR
be open any more when the program is reincarnated, with possible
resulting confusion by Perl.
.Sp
This function is now largely obsolete, mostly because it's very hard to
convert a core file into an executable.  That's why you should now invoke
it as \f(CW\*(C`CORE::dump()\*(C'\fR, if you don't want to be warned against a possible
typo.
.Sp
Unlike most named operators, this has the same precedence as assignment.
It is also exempt from the looks-like-a-function rule, so
\&\f(CW\*(C`dump ("foo")."bar"\*(C'\fR will cause \*(L"bar\*(R" to be part of the argument to
\&\f(CW\*(C`dump\*(C'\fR.

When called on a hash in list context, returns a 2\-element list
consisting of the key and value for the next element of a hash.  In Perl
5.12 and later only, it will also return the index and value for the next
element of an array so that you can iterate over it; older Perls consider
this a syntax error.  When called in scalar context, returns only the key
(not the value) in a hash, or the index in an array.
.Sp
Hash entries are returned in an apparently random order.  The actual random
order is specific to a given hash; the exact same series of operations
on two hashes may result in a different order for each hash. Any insertion
into the hash may change the order, as will any deletion, with the exception
that the most recent key returned by \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR may be deleted
without changing the order. So long as a given hash is unmodified you may
rely on \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR to repeatedly return the same order
as each other. See \*(L"Algorithmic Complexity Attacks\*(R" in perlsec for
details on why hash order is randomized. Aside from the guarantees
provided here the exact details of Perl's hash algorithm and the hash
traversal order are subject to change in any release of Perl.
.Sp
After \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR has returned all entries from the hash or array, the next
call to \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR returns the empty list in list context and \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR in
scalar context; the next call following \fIthat\fR one restarts iteration.
Each hash or array has its own internal iterator, accessed by \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR.  The iterator is implicitly reset when \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR has
reached the end as just described; it can be explicitly reset by calling
\&\f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR on the hash or array.  If you add or delete a hash's
elements while iterating over it, entries may be skipped or duplicated\*(--so
don't do that.  Exception: In the current implementation, it is always safe
to delete the item most recently returned by \f(CW\*(C`each()\*(C'\fR, so the following
code works properly:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        while (($key, $value) = each %hash) {
\&          print $key, "\en";
\&          delete $hash{$key};   # This is safe
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
This prints out your environment like the \fIprintenv\fR\|(1) program,
but in a different order:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    while (($key,$value) = each %ENV) {
\&        print "$key=$value\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Starting with Perl 5.14, \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR can take a scalar \s-1EXPR,\s0 which must hold
reference to an unblessed hash or array.  The argument will be dereferenced
automatically.  This aspect of \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR is considered highly experimental.
The exact behaviour may change in a future version of Perl.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    while (($key,$value) = each $hashref) { ... }
.Ve
.Sp
As of Perl 5.18 you can use a bare \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR in a \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR loop,
which will set \f(CW$_\fR on every iteration.

To avoid confusing would-be users of your code who are running earlier

Returns 1 if the next read on \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 will return end of file \fIor\fR if
\&\s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 is not open.  \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 may be an expression whose value
gives the real filehandle.  (Note that this function actually
reads a character and then \f(CW\*(C`ungetc\*(C'\fRs it, so isn't useful in an
interactive context.)  Do not read from a terminal file (or call
\&\f(CW\*(C`eof(FILEHANDLE)\*(C'\fR on it) after end-of-file is reached.  File types such
as terminals may lose the end-of-file condition if you do.
.Sp
An \f(CW\*(C`eof\*(C'\fR without an argument uses the last file read.  Using \f(CW\*(C`eof()\*(C'\fR
with empty parentheses is different.  It refers to the pseudo file
formed from the files listed on the command line and accessed via the
\&\f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR operator.  Since \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR isn't explicitly opened,
as a normal filehandle is, an \f(CW\*(C`eof()\*(C'\fR before \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR has been
used will cause \f(CW@ARGV\fR to be examined to determine if input is
available.   Similarly, an \f(CW\*(C`eof()\*(C'\fR after \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR has returned
end-of-file will assume you are processing another \f(CW@ARGV\fR list,
and if you haven't set \f(CW@ARGV\fR, will read input from \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR;
see \*(L"I/O Operators\*(R" in perlop.
.Sp
In a \f(CW\*(C`while (<>)\*(C'\fR loop, \f(CW\*(C`eof\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`eof(ARGV)\*(C'\fR can be used to
detect the end of each file, whereas \f(CW\*(C`eof()\*(C'\fR will detect the end 
of the very last file only.  Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    # reset line numbering on each input file
\&    while (<>) {
\&        next if /^\es*#/;  # skip comments
\&        print "$.\et$_";
\&    } continue {
\&        close ARGV if eof;  # Not eof()!
\&    }
\&
\&    # insert dashes just before last line of last file
\&    while (<>) {
\&        if (eof()) {  # check for end of last file
\&            print "\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\en";
\&        }
\&        print;
\&        last if eof();     # needed if we\*(Aqre reading from a terminal
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Practical hint: you almost never need to use \f(CW\*(C`eof\*(C'\fR in Perl, because the
input operators typically return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR when they run out of data or 
encounter an error.

.PD
In the first form, the return value of \s-1EXPR\s0 is parsed and executed as if it
were a little Perl program.  The value of the expression (which is itself
determined within scalar context) is first parsed, and if there were no
errors, executed as a block within the lexical context of the current Perl
program.  This means, that in particular, any outer lexical variables are
visible to it, and any package variable settings or subroutine and format
definitions remain afterwards.
.Sp
Note that the value is parsed every time the \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR executes.
If \s-1EXPR\s0 is omitted, evaluates \f(CW$_\fR.  This form is typically used to
delay parsing and subsequent execution of the text of \s-1EXPR\s0 until run time.
.Sp
If the \f(CW\*(C`unicode_eval\*(C'\fR feature is enabled (which is the default under a
\&\f(CW\*(C`use 5.16\*(C'\fR or higher declaration), \s-1EXPR\s0 or \f(CW$_\fR is treated as a string of
characters, so \f(CW\*(C`use utf8\*(C'\fR declarations have no effect, and source filters
are forbidden.  In the absence of the \f(CW\*(C`unicode_eval\*(C'\fR feature, the string
will sometimes be treated as characters and sometimes as bytes, depending
on the internal encoding, and source filters activated within the \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR
exhibit the erratic, but historical, behaviour of affecting some outer file
scope that is still compiling.  See also the \*(L"evalbytes\*(R" keyword, which
always treats its input as a byte stream and works properly with source
filters, and the feature pragma.
.Sp
In the second form, the code within the \s-1BLOCK\s0 is parsed only once\*(--at the
same time the code surrounding the \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR itself was parsed\*(--and executed
within the context of the current Perl program.  This form is typically
used to trap exceptions more efficiently than the first (see below), while
also providing the benefit of checking the code within \s-1BLOCK\s0 at compile
time.
.Sp
The final semicolon, if any, may be omitted from the value of \s-1EXPR\s0 or within
the \s-1BLOCK.\s0
.Sp
In both forms, the value returned is the value of the last expression
evaluated inside the mini-program; a return statement may be also used, just
as with subroutines.  The expression providing the return value is evaluated
in void, scalar, or list context, depending on the context of the \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR 
itself.  See \*(L"wantarray\*(R" for more on how the evaluation context can be 
determined.
.Sp
If there is a syntax error or runtime error, or a \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR statement is
executed, \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR in scalar context
or an empty list in list context, and \f(CW$@\fR is set to the error
message.  (Prior to 5.16, a bug caused \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR to be returned
in list context for syntax errors, but not for runtime errors.)
If there was no error, \f(CW$@\fR is set to the empty string.  A
control flow operator like \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR can bypass the setting of
\&\f(CW$@\fR.  Beware that using \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR neither silences Perl from printing
warnings to \s-1STDERR,\s0 nor does it stuff the text of warning messages into \f(CW$@\fR.
To do either of those, you have to use the \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR facility, or
turn off warnings inside the \s-1BLOCK\s0 or \s-1EXPR\s0 using \f(CW\*(C`no\ warnings\ \*(Aqall\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.
See \*(L"warn\*(R", perlvar, warnings and perllexwarn.
.Sp
Note that, because \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR traps otherwise-fatal errors, it is useful for
determining whether a particular feature (such as \f(CW\*(C`socket\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`symlink\*(C'\fR)
is implemented.  It is also Perl's exception-trapping mechanism, where
the die operator is used to raise exceptions.
.Sp
If you want to trap errors when loading an \s-1XS\s0 module, some problems with
the binary interface (such as Perl version skew) may be fatal even with
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR unless \f(CW$ENV{PERL_DL_NONLAZY}\fR is set.  See perlrun.
.Sp
If the code to be executed doesn't vary, you may use the eval-BLOCK
form to trap run-time errors without incurring the penalty of
recompiling each time.  The error, if any, is still returned in \f(CW$@\fR.
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # make divide\-by\-zero nonfatal
\&    eval { $answer = $a / $b; }; warn $@ if $@;
\&
\&    # same thing, but less efficient
\&    eval \*(Aq$answer = $a / $b\*(Aq; warn $@ if $@;
\&
\&    # a compile\-time error
\&    eval { $answer = }; # WRONG
\&
\&    # a run\-time error
\&    eval \*(Aq$answer =\*(Aq;   # sets $@
.Ve
.Sp
Using the \f(CW\*(C`eval{}\*(C'\fR form as an exception trap in libraries does have some
issues.  Due to the current arguably broken state of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR hooks, you
may wish not to trigger any \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR hooks that user code may have installed.
You can use the \f(CW\*(C`local $SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\*(C'\fR construct for this purpose,
as this example shows:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    # a private exception trap for divide\-by\-zero
\&    eval { local $SIG{\*(Aq_\|_DIE_\|_\*(Aq}; $answer = $a / $b; };
\&    warn $@ if $@;
.Ve
.Sp
This is especially significant, given that \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR hooks can call
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR again, which has the effect of changing their error messages:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    # _\|_DIE_\|_ hooks may modify error messages
\&    {
\&       local $SIG{\*(Aq_\|_DIE_\|_\*(Aq} =
\&              sub { (my $x = $_[0]) =~ s/foo/bar/g; die $x };
\&       eval { die "foo lives here" };
\&       print $@ if $@;                # prints "bar lives here"
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Because this promotes action at a distance, this counterintuitive behavior
may be fixed in a future release.
.Sp
With an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR, you should be especially careful to remember what's
being looked at when:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    eval $x;        # CASE 1
\&    eval "$x";      # CASE 2
\&
\&    eval \*(Aq$x\*(Aq;      # CASE 3
\&    eval { $x };    # CASE 4
\&
\&    eval "\e$$x++";  # CASE 5
\&    $$x++;          # CASE 6
.Ve
.Sp
Cases 1 and 2 above behave identically: they run the code contained in
the variable \f(CW$x\fR.  (Although case 2 has misleading double quotes making
the reader wonder what else might be happening (nothing is).)  Cases 3
and 4 likewise behave in the same way: they run the code \f(CW\*(Aq$x\*(Aq\fR, which
does nothing but return the value of \f(CW$x\fR.  (Case 4 is preferred for
purely visual reasons, but it also has the advantage of compiling at
compile-time instead of at run-time.)  Case 5 is a place where
normally you \fIwould\fR like to use double quotes, except that in this
particular situation, you can just use symbolic references instead, as
in case 6.
.Sp
Before Perl 5.14, the assignment to \f(CW$@\fR occurred before restoration 
of localized variables, which means that for your code to run on older
versions, a temporary is required if you want to mask some but not all
errors:
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&    # alter $@ on nefarious repugnancy only
\&    {
\&       my $e;
\&       {
\&         local $@; # protect existing $@
\&         eval { test_repugnancy() };
\&         # $@ =~ /nefarious/ and die $@; # Perl 5.14 and higher only
\&         $@ =~ /nefarious/ and $e = $@;
\&       }
\&       die $e if defined $e
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval BLOCK\*(C'\fR does \fInot\fR count as a loop, so the loop control statements
\&\f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`redo\*(C'\fR cannot be used to leave or restart the block.
.Sp
An \f(CW\*(C`eval \*(Aq\*(Aq\*(C'\fR executed within a subroutine defined
in the \f(CW\*(C`DB\*(C'\fR package doesn't see the usual
surrounding lexical scope, but rather the scope of the first non-DB piece
of code that called it.  You don't normally need to worry about this unless
you are writing a Perl debugger.

If there is more than one argument in \s-1LIST,\s0 or if \s-1LIST\s0 is an array
with more than one value, calls \fIexecvp\fR\|(3) with the arguments in \s-1LIST.\s0
If there is only one scalar argument or an array with one element in it,
the argument is checked for shell metacharacters, and if there are any,
the entire argument is passed to the system's command shell for parsing
(this is \f(CW\*(C`/bin/sh \-c\*(C'\fR on Unix platforms, but varies on other platforms).
If there are no shell metacharacters in the argument, it is split into
words and passed directly to \f(CW\*(C`execvp\*(C'\fR, which is more efficient.
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    exec \*(Aq/bin/echo\*(Aq, \*(AqYour arguments are: \*(Aq, @ARGV;
\&    exec "sort $outfile | uniq";
.Ve
.Sp
If you don't really want to execute the first argument, but want to lie
to the program you are executing about its own name, you can specify
the program you actually want to run as an \*(L"indirect object\*(R" (without a
comma) in front of the \s-1LIST.  \s0(This always forces interpretation of the
\&\s-1LIST\s0 as a multivalued list, even if there is only a single scalar in
the list.)  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $shell = \*(Aq/bin/csh\*(Aq;
\&    exec $shell \*(Aq\-sh\*(Aq;    # pretend it\*(Aqs a login shell

.Vb 1
\&    exec {\*(Aq/bin/csh\*(Aq} \*(Aq\-sh\*(Aq;  # pretend it\*(Aqs a login shell
.Ve
.Sp
When the arguments get executed via the system shell, results are
subject to its quirks and capabilities.  See \*(L"`STRING`\*(R" in perlop
for details.
.Sp
Using an indirect object with \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR is also more
secure.  This usage (which also works fine with \fIsystem()\fR) forces
interpretation of the arguments as a multivalued list, even if the
list had just one argument.  That way you're safe from the shell
expanding wildcards or splitting up words with whitespace in them.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @args = ( "echo surprise" );

A hash or array element can be true only if it's defined and defined only if
it exists, but the reverse doesn't necessarily hold true.
.Sp
Given an expression that specifies the name of a subroutine,
returns true if the specified subroutine has ever been declared, even
if it is undefined.  Mentioning a subroutine name for exists or defined
does not count as declaring it.  Note that a subroutine that does not
exist may still be callable: its package may have an \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR
method that makes it spring into existence the first time that it is
called; see perlsub.

Note that the \s-1EXPR\s0 can be arbitrarily complicated as long as the final

Although the most deeply nested array or hash element will not spring into
existence just because its existence was tested, any intervening ones will.
Thus \f(CW\*(C`$ref\->{"A"}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`$ref\->{"A"}\->{"B"}\*(C'\fR will spring
into existence due to the existence test for the \f(CW$key\fR element above.
This happens anywhere the arrow operator is used, including even here:
.Sp

universally recognized values for \s-1EXPR\s0 are \f(CW0\fR for success and \f(CW1\fR
for error; other values are subject to interpretation depending on the
environment in which the Perl program is running.  For example, exiting
69 (\s-1EX_UNAVAILABLE\s0) from a \fIsendmail\fR incoming-mail filter will cause
the mailer to return the item undelivered, but that's not true everywhere.
.Sp
Don't use \f(CW\*(C`exit\*(C'\fR to abort a subroutine if there's any chance that
someone might want to trap whatever error happened.  Use \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR instead,
which can be trapped by an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The \fIexit()\fR function does not always exit immediately.  It calls any
defined \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR routines first, but these \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR routines may not
themselves abort the exit.  Likewise any object destructors that need to
be called are called before the real exit.  \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR routines and destructors
can change the exit status by modifying \f(CW$?\fR.  If this is a problem, you
can call \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::_exit($status)\*(C'\fR to avoid \s-1END\s0 and destructor processing.

.Sp
Casefolding is the process of mapping strings to a form where case
differences are erased; comparing two strings in their casefolded
form is effectively a way of asking if two strings are equal,
regardless of case.
.Sp
Roughly, if you ever found yourself writing this
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    lc($this) eq lc($that)    # Wrong!
\&        # or
\&    uc($this) eq uc($that)    # Also wrong!
\&        # or
\&    $this =~ /^\eQ$that\eE\ez/i  # Right!
.Ve
.Sp
Now you can write
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    fc($this) eq fc($that)
.Ve
.Sp
And get the correct results.
.Sp
Perl only implements the full form of casefolding,
but you can access the simple folds using \*(L"\fIcasefold()\fR\*(R" in Unicode::UCD and
\&\*(L"\fIprop_invmap()\fR\*(R" in Unicode::UCD.
For further information on casefolding, refer to
the Unicode Standard, specifically sections 3.13 \f(CW\*(C`Default Case Operations\*(C'\fR,
4.2 \f(CW\*(C`Case\-Normative\*(C'\fR, and 5.18 \f(CW\*(C`Case Mappings\*(C'\fR,
available at <http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/>, as well as the
Case Charts available at <http://www.unicode.org/charts/case/>.
.Sp
If \s-1EXPR\s0 is omitted, uses \f(CW$_\fR.
.Sp
This function behaves the same way under various pragma, such as in a locale,
as \*(L"lc\*(R" does.
.Sp
While the Unicode Standard defines two additional forms of casefolding,
one for Turkic languages and one that never maps one character into multiple
characters, these are not provided by the Perl core; However, the \s-1CPAN\s0 module
\&\f(CW\*(C`Unicode::Casing\*(C'\fR may be used to provide an implementation.
.Sp
This keyword is available only when the \f(CW"fc"\fR feature is enabled,

You don't have to check for \f(CW\*(C`defined\*(C'\fR on the return from \f(CW\*(C`fcntl\*(C'\fR.
Like \f(CW\*(C`ioctl\*(C'\fR, it maps a \f(CW0\fR return from the system call into
\&\f(CW"0 but true"\fR in Perl.  This string is true in boolean context and \f(CW0\fR
in numeric context.  It is also exempt from the normal \fB\-w\fR warnings
on improper numeric conversions.
.Sp
Note that \f(CW\*(C`fcntl\*(C'\fR raises an exception if used on a machine that
doesn't implement \fIfcntl\fR\|(2).  See the Fcntl module or your \fIfcntl\fR\|(2)

.IX Item "flock FILEHANDLE,OPERATION "
Calls \fIflock\fR\|(2), or an emulation of it, on \s-1FILEHANDLE. \s0 Returns true
for success, false on failure.  Produces a fatal error if used on a
machine that doesn't implement \fIflock\fR\|(2), \fIfcntl\fR\|(2) locking, or \fIlockf\fR\|(3).
\&\f(CW\*(C`flock\*(C'\fR is Perl's portable file-locking interface, although it locks
entire files only, not records.
.Sp
Two potentially non-obvious but traditional \f(CW\*(C`flock\*(C'\fR semantics are
that it waits indefinitely until the lock is granted, and that its locks
are \fBmerely advisory\fR.  Such discretionary locks are more flexible, but
offer fewer guarantees.  This means that programs that do not also use
\&\f(CW\*(C`flock\*(C'\fR may modify files locked with \f(CW\*(C`flock\*(C'\fR.  See perlport, 
your port's specific documentation, and your system-specific local manpages
for details.  It's best to assume traditional behavior if you're writing
portable programs.  (But if you're not, you should as always feel perfectly
free to write for your own system's idiosyncrasies (sometimes called
\&\*(L"features\*(R").  Slavish adherence to portability concerns shouldn't get
in the way of your getting your job done.)
.Sp
\&\s-1OPERATION\s0 is one of \s-1LOCK_SH, LOCK_EX,\s0 or \s-1LOCK_UN,\s0 possibly combined with
\&\s-1LOCK_NB. \s0 These constants are traditionally valued 1, 2, 8 and 4, but
you can use the symbolic names if you import them from the Fcntl module,
either individually, or as a group using the \f(CW\*(C`:flock\*(C'\fR tag.  \s-1LOCK_SH\s0
requests a shared lock, \s-1LOCK_EX\s0 requests an exclusive lock, and \s-1LOCK_UN\s0
releases a previously requested lock.  If \s-1LOCK_NB\s0 is bitwise-or'ed with
\&\s-1LOCK_SH\s0 or \s-1LOCK_EX,\s0 then \f(CW\*(C`flock\*(C'\fR returns immediately rather than blocking
waiting for the lock; check the return status to see if you got it.
.Sp
To avoid the possibility of miscoordination, Perl now flushes \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0
before locking or unlocking it.
.Sp
Note that the emulation built with \fIlockf\fR\|(3) doesn't provide shared
locks, and it requires that \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 be open with write intent.  These
are the semantics that \fIlockf\fR\|(3) implements.  Most if not all systems
implement \fIlockf\fR\|(3) in terms of \fIfcntl\fR\|(2) locking, though, so the
differing semantics shouldn't bite too many people.
.Sp
Note that the \fIfcntl\fR\|(2) emulation of \fIflock\fR\|(3) requires that \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0
be open with read intent to use \s-1LOCK_SH\s0 and requires that it be open
with write intent to use \s-1LOCK_EX.\s0
.Sp
Note also that some versions of \f(CW\*(C`flock\*(C'\fR cannot lock things over the
network; you would need to use the more system-specific \f(CW\*(C`fcntl\*(C'\fR for
that.  If you like you can force Perl to ignore your system's \fIflock\fR\|(2)
function, and so provide its own \fIfcntl\fR\|(2)\-based emulation, by passing
the switch \f(CW\*(C`\-Ud_flock\*(C'\fR to the \fIConfigure\fR program when you configure
and build a new Perl.

On systems that support a real \fIflock\fR\|(2), locks are inherited across \fIfork()\fR

.IP "fork" 4
.IX Xref "fork child parent"

Does a \fIfork\fR\|(2) system call to create a new process running the
same program at the same point.  It returns the child pid to the
parent process, \f(CW0\fR to the child process, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the fork is
unsuccessful.  File descriptors (and sometimes locks on those descriptors)
are shared, while everything else is copied.  On most systems supporting
\&\fIfork()\fR, great care has gone into making it extremely efficient (for
example, using copy-on-write technology on data pages), making it the
dominant paradigm for multitasking over the last few decades.
.Sp
Perl attempts to flush all files opened for
output before forking the child process, but this may not be supported
on some platforms (see perlport).  To be safe, you may need to set
\&\f(CW$|\fR ($AUTOFLUSH in English) or call the \f(CW\*(C`autoflush()\*(C'\fR method of
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::Handle\*(C'\fR on any open handles to avoid duplicate output.
.Sp
If you \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR without ever waiting on your children, you will
accumulate zombies.  On some systems, you can avoid this by setting
\&\f(CW$SIG{CHLD}\fR to \f(CW"IGNORE"\fR.  See also perlipc for more examples of
forking and reaping moribund children.
.Sp
Note that if your forked child inherits system file descriptors like
\&\s-1STDIN\s0 and \s-1STDOUT\s0 that are actually connected by a pipe or socket, even
if you exit, then the remote server (such as, say, a \s-1CGI\s0 script or a
backgrounded job launched from a remote shell) won't think you're done.
You should reopen those to \fI/dev/null\fR if it's any issue.
.Sp
On some platforms such as Windows, where the \fIfork()\fR system call is not available,
Perl can be built to emulate \fIfork()\fR in the Perl interpreter.
The emulation is designed, at the level of the Perl program,
to be as compatible as possible with the \*(L"Unix\*(R" \fIfork()\fR.
However it has limitations that have to be considered in code intended to be portable.

.IP "formline \s-1PICTURE,LIST \s0" 4
.IX Xref "formline"
.IX Item "formline PICTURE,LIST "
This is an internal function used by \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fRs, though you may call it,
too.  It formats (see perlform) a list of values according to the
contents of \s-1PICTURE,\s0 placing the output into the format output
accumulator, \f(CW$^A\fR (or \f(CW$ACCUMULATOR\fR in English).
Eventually, when a \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR is done, the contents of
\&\f(CW$^A\fR are written to some filehandle.  You could also read \f(CW$^A\fR
and then set \f(CW$^A\fR back to \f(CW""\fR.  Note that a format typically
does one \f(CW\*(C`formline\*(C'\fR per line of form, but the \f(CW\*(C`formline\*(C'\fR function itself
doesn't care how many newlines are embedded in the \s-1PICTURE. \s0 This means
that the \f(CW\*(C`~\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR tokens treat the entire \s-1PICTURE\s0 as a single line.
You may therefore need to use multiple formlines to implement a single
record format, just like the \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR compiler.

Be careful if you put double quotes around the picture, because an \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR

\&\f(CW\*(C`formline\*(C'\fR always returns true.  See perlform for other examples.
.Sp
If you are trying to use this instead of \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR to capture the output,

These routines are the same as their counterparts in the
system C library.  In list context, the return values from the
various get routines are as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 7

\&       $quota,$comment,$gcos,$dir,$shell,$expire) = getpw*
\&    ($name,$passwd,$gid,$members) = getgr*

The exact meaning of the \f(CW$gcos\fR field varies but it usually contains
the real name of the user (as opposed to the login name) and other
information pertaining to the user.  Beware, however, that in many
system users are able to change this information and therefore it
cannot be trusted and therefore the \f(CW$gcos\fR is tainted (see
perlsec).  The \f(CW$passwd\fR and \f(CW$shell\fR, user's encrypted password and
login shell, are also tainted, for the same reason.
.Sp
In scalar context, you get the name, unless the function was a
lookup by name, in which case you get the other thing, whatever it is.
(If the entry doesn't exist you get the undefined value.)  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    $uid   = getpwnam($name);
\&    $name  = getpwuid($num);
\&    $name  = getpwent();
\&    $gid   = getgrnam($name);

\&    $name  = getgrent();
\&    #etc.
.Ve

In \fIgetpw*()\fR the fields \f(CW$quota\fR, \f(CW$comment\fR, and \f(CW$expire\fR are special
in that they are unsupported on many systems.  If the
\&\f(CW$quota\fR is unsupported, it is an empty scalar.  If it is supported, it
usually encodes the disk quota.  If the \f(CW$comment\fR field is unsupported,
it is an empty scalar.  If it is supported it usually encodes some
administrative comment about the user.  In some systems the \f(CW$quota\fR
field may be \f(CW$change\fR or \f(CW$age\fR, fields that have to do with password
aging.  In some systems the \f(CW$comment\fR field may be \f(CW$class\fR.  The \f(CW$expire\fR
field, if present, encodes the expiration period of the account or the
password.  For the availability and the exact meaning of these fields
in your system, please consult \fIgetpwnam\fR\|(3) and your system's 
\&\fIpwd.h\fR file.  You can also find out from within Perl what your
\&\f(CW$quota\fR and \f(CW$comment\fR fields mean and whether you have the \f(CW$expire\fR field
by using the \f(CW\*(C`Config\*(C'\fR module and the values \f(CW\*(C`d_pwquota\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`d_pwage\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`d_pwchange\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`d_pwcomment\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`d_pwexpire\*(C'\fR.  Shadow password
files are supported only if your vendor has implemented them in the
intuitive fashion that calling the regular C library routines gets the
shadow versions if you're running under privilege or if there exists
the \fIshadow\fR\|(3) functions as found in System V (this includes Solaris
and Linux).  Those systems that implement a proprietary shadow password
facility are unlikely to be supported.
.Sp
The \f(CW$members\fR value returned by \fIgetgr*()\fR is a space-separated list of
the login names of the members of the group.
.Sp
For the \fIgethost*()\fR functions, if the \f(CW\*(C`h_errno\*(C'\fR variable is supported in
C, it will be returned to you via \f(CW$?\fR if the function call fails.  The
\&\f(CW@addrs\fR value returned by a successful call is a list of raw
addresses returned by the corresponding library call.  In the
Internet domain, each address is four bytes long; you can unpack it
by saying something like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ($a,$b,$c,$d) = unpack(\*(AqW4\*(Aq,$addr[0]);
.Ve
.Sp
The Socket library makes this slightly easier:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    use Socket;
\&    $iaddr = inet_aton("127.1"); # or whatever address
\&    $name  = gethostbyaddr($iaddr, AF_INET);
\&
\&    # or going the other way
\&    $straddr = inet_ntoa($iaddr);
.Ve
.Sp
In the opposite way, to resolve a hostname to the \s-1IP\s0 address
you can write this:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    use Socket;
\&    $packed_ip = gethostbyname("www.perl.org");
\&    if (defined $packed_ip) {
\&        $ip_address = inet_ntoa($packed_ip);
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Make sure \f(CW\*(C`gethostbyname()\*(C'\fR is called in \s-1SCALAR\s0 context and that
its return value is checked for definedness.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`getprotobynumber\*(C'\fR function, even though it only takes one argument,
has the precedence of a list operator, so beware:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    getprotobynumber $number eq \*(Aqicmp\*(Aq   # WRONG
\&    getprotobynumber($number eq \*(Aqicmp\*(Aq)  # actually means this
\&    getprotobynumber($number) eq \*(Aqicmp\*(Aq  # better this way
.Ve
.Sp
If you get tired of remembering which element of the return list
contains which return value, by-name interfaces are provided
in standard modules: \f(CW\*(C`File::stat\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Net::hostent\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Net::netent\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::protoent\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Net::servent\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Time::gmtime\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Time::localtime\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`User::grent\*(C'\fR.  These override the normal built-ins, supplying
versions that return objects with the appropriate names
for each field.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   use File::stat;
\&   use User::pwent;
\&   $is_his = (stat($filename)\->uid == pwent($whoever)\->uid);
.Ve
.Sp
Even though it looks as though they're the same method calls (uid),
they aren't, because a \f(CW\*(C`File::stat\*(C'\fR object is different from
a \f(CW\*(C`User::pwent\*(C'\fR object.

.IP "getsockopt \s-1SOCKET,LEVEL,OPTNAME \s0" 4

.IX Item "getsockopt SOCKET,LEVEL,OPTNAME "
Queries the option named \s-1OPTNAME\s0 associated with \s-1SOCKET\s0 at a given \s-1LEVEL.\s0
Options may exist at multiple protocol levels depending on the socket
type, but at least the uppermost socket level \s-1SOL_SOCKET \s0(defined in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Socket\*(C'\fR module) will exist.  To query options at another level the
protocol number of the appropriate protocol controlling the option
should be supplied.  For example, to indicate that an option is to be
interpreted by the \s-1TCP\s0 protocol, \s-1LEVEL\s0 should be set to the protocol
number of \s-1TCP,\s0 which you can get using \f(CW\*(C`getprotobyname\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The function returns a packed string representing the requested socket
option, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on error, with the reason for the error placed in
\&\f(CW$!\fR.  Just what is in the packed string depends on \s-1LEVEL\s0 and \s-1OPTNAME\s0;
consult \fIgetsockopt\fR\|(2) for details.  A common case is that the option is an
integer, in which case the result is a packed integer, which you can decode
using \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR with the \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`I\*(C'\fR) format.

.IX Item "glob"
.PD
In list context, returns a (possibly empty) list of filename expansions on
the value of \s-1EXPR\s0 such as the standard Unix shell \fI/bin/csh\fR would do.  In
scalar context, glob iterates through such filename expansions, returning
undef when the list is exhausted.  This is the internal function
implementing the \f(CW\*(C`<*.c>\*(C'\fR operator, but you can use it directly.  If
\&\s-1EXPR\s0 is omitted, \f(CW$_\fR is used.  The \f(CW\*(C`<*.c>\*(C'\fR operator is discussed in
more detail in \*(L"I/O Operators\*(R" in perlop.
.Sp
Note that \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR splits its arguments on whitespace and treats
each segment as separate pattern.  As such, \f(CW\*(C`glob("*.c *.h")\*(C'\fR 
matches all files with a \fI.c\fR or \fI.h\fR extension.  The expression
\&\f(CW\*(C`glob(".* *")\*(C'\fR matches all files in the current working directory.
If you want to glob filenames that might contain whitespace, you'll
have to use extra quotes around the spacey filename to protect it.
For example, to glob filenames that have an \f(CW\*(C`e\*(C'\fR followed by a space
followed by an \f(CW\*(C`f\*(C'\fR, use either of:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    @spacies = <"*e f*">;
\&    @spacies = glob \*(Aq"*e f*"\*(Aq;
\&    @spacies = glob q("*e f*");
.Ve
.Sp
If you had to get a variable through, you could do this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    @spacies = glob "\*(Aq*${var}e f*\*(Aq";
\&    @spacies = glob qq("*${var}e f*");
.Ve
.Sp
If non-empty braces are the only wildcard characters used in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR, no filenames are matched, but potentially many strings
are returned.  For example, this produces nine strings, one for
each pairing of fruits and colors:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @many =  glob "{apple,tomato,cherry}={green,yellow,red}";
.Ve
.Sp
This operator is implemented using the standard
\&\f(CW\*(C`File::Glob\*(C'\fR extension.  See File::Glob for details, including
\&\f(CW\*(C`bsd_glob\*(C'\fR which does not treat whitespace as a pattern separator.

The \f(CW\*(C`goto\-LABEL\*(C'\fR form finds the statement labeled with \s-1LABEL\s0 and
resumes execution there.  It can't be used to get out of a block or
subroutine given to \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR.  It can be used to go almost anywhere
else within the dynamic scope, including out of subroutines, but it's
usually better to use some other construct such as \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.
The author of Perl has never felt the need to use this form of \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR
(in Perl, that is; C is another matter).  (The difference is that C
does not offer named loops combined with loop control.  Perl does, and
this replaces most structured uses of \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR in other languages.)
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`goto\-EXPR\*(C'\fR form expects a label name, whose scope will be resolved
dynamically.  This allows for computed \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fRs per \s-1FORTRAN,\s0 but isn't
necessarily recommended if you're optimizing for maintainability:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    goto ("FOO", "BAR", "GLARCH")[$i];
.Ve
.Sp
As shown in this example, \f(CW\*(C`goto\-EXPR\*(C'\fR is exempt from the \*(L"looks like a
function\*(R" rule.  A pair of parentheses following it does not (necessarily)
delimit its argument.  \f(CW\*(C`goto("NE")."XT"\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`goto NEXT\*(C'\fR.
Also, unlike most named operators, this has the same precedence as
assignment.
.Sp
Use of \f(CW\*(C`goto\-LABEL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`goto\-EXPR\*(C'\fR to jump into a construct is
deprecated and will issue a warning.  Even then, it may not be used to
go into any construct that requires initialization, such as a
subroutine or a \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR loop.  It also can't be used to go into a
construct that is optimized away.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`goto\-&NAME\*(C'\fR form is quite different from the other forms of
\&\f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR.  In fact, it isn't a goto in the normal sense at all, and
doesn't have the stigma associated with other gotos.  Instead, it
exits the current subroutine (losing any changes set by \fIlocal()\fR) and
immediately calls in its place the named subroutine using the current
value of \f(CW@_\fR.  This is used by \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR subroutines that wish to
load another subroutine and then pretend that the other subroutine had
been called in the first place (except that any modifications to \f(CW@_\fR
in the current subroutine are propagated to the other subroutine.)
After the \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR, not even \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR will be able to tell that this
routine was called first.

\&\s-1NAME\s0 needn't be the name of a subroutine; it can be a scalar variable

reference.

.Vb 1

Note that \f(CW$_\fR is an alias to the list value, so it can be used to
modify the elements of the \s-1LIST. \s0 While this is useful and supported,
it can cause bizarre results if the elements of \s-1LIST\s0 are not variables.
Similarly, grep returns aliases into the original list, much as a for
loop's index variable aliases the list elements.  That is, modifying an
element of a list returned by grep (for example, in a \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR
or another \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR) actually modifies the element in the original list.
This is usually something to be avoided when writing clear code.
.Sp
If \f(CW$_\fR is lexical in the scope where the \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR appears (because it has
been declared with the deprecated \f(CW\*(C`my $_\*(C'\fR construct)
then, in addition to being locally aliased to
the list elements, \f(CW$_\fR keeps being lexical inside the block; i.e., it
can't be seen from the outside, avoiding any potential side-effects.

true, add a \f(CW0\fR to the scalar before using it.)  The \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR
functions may be needed to manipulate the values of structures used by
\&\f(CW\*(C`ioctl\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The return value of \f(CW\*(C`ioctl\*(C'\fR (and \f(CW\*(C`fcntl\*(C'\fR) is as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    if OS returns:      then Perl returns:
\&        \-1               undefined value
\&         0              string "0 but true"
\&    anything else           that number
.Ve
.Sp
Thus Perl returns true on success and false on failure, yet you can
still easily determine the actual value returned by the operating
system:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $retval = ioctl(...) || \-1;
\&    printf "System returned %d\en", $retval;

Called in list context, returns a list consisting of all the keys of the
named hash, or in Perl 5.12 or later only, the indices of an array.  Perl
releases prior to 5.12 will produce a syntax error if you try to use an
array argument.  In scalar context, returns the number of keys or indices.
.Sp
Hash entries are returned in an apparently random order.  The actual random
order is specific to a given hash; the exact same series of operations
on two hashes may result in a different order for each hash. Any insertion
into the hash may change the order, as will any deletion, with the exception
that the most recent key returned by \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR may be deleted
without changing the order. So long as a given hash is unmodified you may
rely on \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR to repeatedly return the same order
as each other. See \*(L"Algorithmic Complexity Attacks\*(R" in perlsec for
details on why hash order is randomized. Aside from the guarantees
provided here the exact details of Perl's hash algorithm and the hash
traversal order are subject to change in any release of Perl.
.Sp
As a side effect, calling \fIkeys()\fR resets the internal iterator of the \s-1HASH\s0 or
\&\s-1ARRAY \s0(see \*(L"each\*(R").  In particular, calling \fIkeys()\fR in void context resets
the iterator with no other overhead.
.Sp
Here is yet another way to print your environment:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    @keys = keys %ENV;
\&    @values = values %ENV;
\&    while (@keys) {
\&        print pop(@keys), \*(Aq=\*(Aq, pop(@values), "\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
or how about sorted by key:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    foreach $key (sort(keys %ENV)) {
\&        print $key, \*(Aq=\*(Aq, $ENV{$key}, "\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
The returned values are copies of the original keys in the hash, so
modifying them will not affect the original hash.  Compare \*(L"values\*(R".
.Sp
To sort a hash by value, you'll need to use a \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR function.
Here's a descending numeric sort of a hash by its values:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    foreach $key (sort { $hash{$b} <=> $hash{$a} } keys %hash) {
\&        printf "%4d %s\en", $hash{$key}, $key;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Used as an lvalue, \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR allows you to increase the number of hash buckets
allocated for the given hash.  This can gain you a measure of efficiency if
you know the hash is going to get big.  (This is similar to pre-extending
an array by assigning a larger number to $#array.)  If you say
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    keys %hash = 200;
.Ve
.Sp
then \f(CW%hash\fR will have at least 200 buckets allocated for it\-\-256 of them,
in fact, since it rounds up to the next power of two.  These
buckets will be retained even if you do \f(CW\*(C`%hash = ()\*(C'\fR, use \f(CW\*(C`undef
%hash\*(C'\fR if you want to free the storage while \f(CW%hash\fR is still in scope.
You can't shrink the number of buckets allocated for the hash using
\&\f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR in this way (but you needn't worry about doing this by accident,
as trying has no effect).  \f(CW\*(C`keys @array\*(C'\fR in an lvalue context is a syntax
error.
.Sp
Starting with Perl 5.14, \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR can take a scalar \s-1EXPR,\s0 which must contain
a reference to an unblessed hash or array.  The argument will be
dereferenced automatically.  This aspect of \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR is considered highly
experimental.  The exact behaviour may change in a future version of Perl.
.Sp

\&    for (keys $hashref) { ... }

To avoid confusing would-be users of your code who are running earlier
versions of Perl with mysterious syntax errors, put this sort of thing at
the top of your file to signal that your code will work \fIonly\fR on Perls of
a recent vintage:
.Sp

Sends a signal to a list of processes.  Returns the number of

\&    kill \*(AqKILL\*(Aq, @goners;
.Ve
.Sp
\&\s-1SIGNAL\s0 may be either a signal name (a string) or a signal number.  A signal
name may start with a \f(CW\*(C`SIG\*(C'\fR prefix, thus \f(CW\*(C`FOO\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SIGFOO\*(C'\fR refer to the
same signal.  The string form of \s-1SIGNAL\s0 is recommended for portability because
the same signal may have different numbers in different operating systems.
.Sp
A list of signal names supported by the current platform can be found in
\&\f(CW$Config{sig_name}\fR, which is provided by the \f(CW\*(C`Config\*(C'\fR module. See Config
for more details.
.Sp
A negative signal name is the same as a negative signal number, killing process
groups instead of processes.  For example, \f(CW\*(C`kill \*(Aq\-KILL\*(Aq, $pgrp\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`kill \-9, $pgrp\*(C'\fR will send \f(CW\*(C`SIGKILL\*(C'\fR to the entire process group specified. That
means you usually want to use positive not negative signals.
.Sp
If \s-1SIGNAL\s0 is either the number 0 or the string \f(CW\*(C`ZERO\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`SIGZZERO\*(C'\fR),
no signal is sent to
the process, but \f(CW\*(C`kill\*(C'\fR checks whether it's \fIpossible\fR to send a signal to it
(that means, to be brief, that the process is owned by the same user, or we are
the super-user).  This is useful to check that a child process is still
alive (even if only as a zombie) and hasn't changed its \s-1UID. \s0 See
perlport for notes on the portability of this construct.
.Sp
The behavior of kill when a \fI\s-1PROCESS\s0\fR number is zero or negative depends on
the operating system.  For example, on POSIX-conforming systems, zero will
signal the current process group, \-1 will signal all processes, and any
other negative \s-1PROCESS\s0 number will act as a negative signal number and
kill the entire process group specified.
.Sp
If both the \s-1SIGNAL\s0 and the \s-1PROCESS\s0 are negative, the results are undefined.
A warning may be produced in a future version.
.Sp
See \*(L"Signals\*(R" in perlipc for more details.
.Sp
On some platforms such as Windows where the \fIfork()\fR system call is not available.
Perl can be built to emulate \fIfork()\fR at the interpreter level.
This emulation has limitations related to kill that have to be considered,
for code running on Windows and in code intended to be portable.
.Sp
See perlfork for more details.
.Sp
If there is no \fI\s-1LIST\s0\fR of processes, no signal is sent, and the return
value is 0.  This form is sometimes used, however, because it causes
tainting checks to be run.  But see

The \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR command is like the \f(CW\*(C`break\*(C'\fR statement in C (as used in
loops); it immediately exits the loop in question.  If the \s-1LABEL\s0 is
omitted, the command refers to the innermost enclosing
loop.  The \f(CW\*(C`last EXPR\*(C'\fR form, available starting in Perl
5.18.0, allows a label name to be computed at run time,
and is otherwise identical to \f(CW\*(C`last LABEL\*(C'\fR.  The
\&\f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR block, if any, is not executed:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    LINE: while (<STDIN>) {
\&        last LINE if /^$/;  # exit when done with header
\&        #...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR cannot be used to exit a block that returns a value such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval {}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sub {}\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`do {}\*(C'\fR, and should not be used to exit
a \fIgrep()\fR or \fImap()\fR operation.
.Sp
Note that a block by itself is semantically identical to a loop
that executes once.  Thus \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR can be used to effect an early
exit out of such a block.
.Sp
See also \*(L"continue\*(R" for an illustration of how \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`redo\*(C'\fR work.
.Sp
Unlike most named operators, this has the same precedence as assignment.
It is also exempt from the looks-like-a-function rule, so
\&\f(CW\*(C`last ("foo")."bar"\*(C'\fR will cause \*(L"bar\*(R" to be part of the argument to

If \s-1EXPR\s0 is omitted, uses \f(CW$_\fR.

What gets returned depends on several factors:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP "If ""use bytes"" is in effect:" 4
.el .IP "If \f(CWuse bytes\fR is in effect:" 4
.IX Item "If use bytes is in effect:"
The results follow \s-1ASCII\s0 semantics.  Only characters \f(CW\*(C`A\-Z\*(C'\fR change, to \f(CW\*(C`a\-z\*(C'\fR
respectively.
.ie n .IP "Otherwise, if ""use locale"" (but not ""use locale \*(Aq:not_characters\*(Aq"") is in effect:" 4
.el .IP "Otherwise, if \f(CWuse locale\fR (but not \f(CWuse locale \*(Aq:not_characters\*(Aq\fR) is in effect:" 4
.IX Item "Otherwise, if use locale (but not use locale :not_characters) is in effect:"
Respects current \s-1LC_CTYPE\s0 locale for code points < 256; and uses Unicode
semantics for the remaining code points (this last can only happen if
the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag is also set).  See perllocale.
.Sp
A deficiency in this is that case changes that cross the 255/256
boundary are not well-defined.  For example, the lower case of \s-1LATIN CAPITAL
LETTER SHARP S \s0(U+1E9E) in Unicode semantics is U+00DF (on \s-1ASCII\s0
platforms).   But under \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR, the lower case of U+1E9E is
itself, because 0xDF may not be \s-1LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S\s0 in the
current locale, and Perl has no way of knowing if that character even
exists in the locale, much less what code point it is.  Perl returns
the input character unchanged, for all instances (and there aren't
many) where the 255/256 boundary would otherwise be crossed.

Note that \f(CW$_\fR is an alias to the list value, so it can be used to
modify the elements of the \s-1LIST. \s0 While this is useful and supported,
it can cause bizarre results if the elements of \s-1LIST\s0 are not variables.
Using a regular \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR loop for this purpose would be clearer in
most cases.  See also \*(L"grep\*(R" for an array composed of those items of
the original list for which the \s-1BLOCK\s0 or \s-1EXPR\s0 evaluates to true.
.Sp
If \f(CW$_\fR is lexical in the scope where the \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR appears (because it has
been declared with the deprecated \f(CW\*(C`my $_\*(C'\fR construct),
then, in addition to being locally aliased to
the list elements, \f(CW$_\fR keeps being lexical inside the block; that is, it
can't be seen from the outside, avoiding any potential side-effects.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR starts both hash references and blocks, so \f(CW\*(C`map { ...\*(C'\fR could be either
the start of map \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0 or map \s-1EXPR, LIST. \s0 Because Perl doesn't look
ahead for the closing \f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR it has to take a guess at which it's dealing with
based on what it finds just after the
\&\f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR.  Usually it gets it right, but if it
doesn't it won't realize something is wrong until it gets to the \f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR and
encounters the missing (or unexpected) comma.  The syntax error will be
reported close to the \f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR, but you'll need to change something near the \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR
such as using a unary \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR to give Perl some help:
.Sp

Creates the directory specified by \s-1FILENAME,\s0 with permissions
specified by \s-1MASK \s0(as modified by \f(CW\*(C`umask\*(C'\fR).  If it succeeds it
returns true; otherwise it returns false and sets \f(CW$!\fR (errno).
\&\s-1MASK\s0 defaults to 0777 if omitted, and \s-1FILENAME\s0 defaults
to \f(CW$_\fR if omitted.
.Sp
In general, it is better to create directories with a permissive \s-1MASK\s0
and let the user modify that with their \f(CW\*(C`umask\*(C'\fR than it is to supply
a restrictive \s-1MASK\s0 and give the user no way to be more permissive.
The exceptions to this rule are when the file or directory should be
kept private (mail files, for instance).  The \fIperlfunc\fR\|(1) entry on
\&\f(CW\*(C`umask\*(C'\fR discusses the choice of \s-1MASK\s0 in more detail.
.Sp
Note that according to the \s-1POSIX 1003.1\-1996\s0 the \s-1FILENAME\s0 may have any
number of trailing slashes.  Some operating and filesystems do not get
this right, so Perl automatically removes all trailing slashes to keep
everyone happy.

The \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR command is like the \f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR statement in C; it starts
the next iteration of the loop:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    LINE: while (<STDIN>) {
\&        next LINE if /^#/;  # discard comments
\&        #...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Note that if there were a \f(CW\*(C`continue\*(C'\fR block on the above, it would get
executed even on discarded lines.  If \s-1LABEL\s0 is omitted, the command
refers to the innermost enclosing loop.  The \f(CW\*(C`next EXPR\*(C'\fR form, available
as of Perl 5.18.0, allows a label name to be computed at run time, being
otherwise identical to \f(CW\*(C`next LABEL\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR cannot be used to exit a block which returns a value such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval {}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sub {}\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`do {}\*(C'\fR, and should not be used to exit
a \fIgrep()\fR or \fImap()\fR operation.
.Sp
Note that a block by itself is semantically identical to a loop
that executes once.  Thus \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR will exit such a block early.

See also \*(L"continue\*(R" for an illustration of how \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR, and

Unlike most named operators, this has the same precedence as assignment.
It is also exempt from the looks-like-a-function rule, so

hex string.  If \s-1EXPR\s0 starts off with \f(CW\*(C`0b\*(C'\fR, it is interpreted as a
binary string.  Leading whitespace is ignored in all three cases.)
The following will handle decimal, binary, octal, and hex in standard
Perl notation:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $val = oct($val) if $val =~ /^0/;
.Ve
.Sp
If \s-1EXPR\s0 is omitted, uses \f(CW$_\fR.   To go the other way (produce a number
in octal), use \fIsprintf()\fR or \fIprintf()\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $dec_perms = (stat("filename"))[2] & 07777;

.Ve

The \fIoct()\fR function is commonly used when a string such as \f(CW644\fR needs
to be converted into a file mode, for example.  Although Perl 
automatically converts strings into numbers as needed, this automatic
conversion assumes base 10.
.Sp
Leading white space is ignored without warning, as too are any trailing 
non-digits, such as a decimal point (\f(CW\*(C`oct\*(C'\fR only handles non-negative
integers, not negative integers or floating point).

Opens the file whose filename is given by \s-1EXPR,\s0 and associates it with
\&\s-1FILEHANDLE.\s0
.Sp
Simple examples to open a file for reading:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    open(my $fh, "<", "input.txt") 
\&        or die "cannot open < input.txt: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
and for writing:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    open(my $fh, ">", "output.txt") 
\&        or die "cannot open > output.txt: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
(The following is a comprehensive reference to \fIopen()\fR: for a gentler
introduction you may consider perlopentut.)
.Sp
If \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 is an undefined scalar variable (or array or hash element), a
new filehandle is autovivified, meaning that the variable is assigned a
reference to a newly allocated anonymous filehandle.  Otherwise if
\&\s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 is an expression, its value is the real filehandle.  (This is
considered a symbolic reference, so \f(CW\*(C`use strict "refs"\*(C'\fR should \fInot\fR be
in effect.)
.Sp
If \s-1EXPR\s0 is omitted, the global (package) scalar variable of the same
name as the \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 contains the filename.  (Note that lexical 
variables\*(--those declared with \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR\-\-will not work for this
purpose; so if you're using \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR, specify \s-1EXPR\s0 in your
call to open.)
.Sp
If three (or more) arguments are specified, the open mode (including
optional encoding) in the second argument are distinct from the filename in
the third.  If \s-1MODE\s0 is \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR or nothing, the file is opened for input.
If \s-1MODE\s0 is \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR, the file is opened for output, with existing files
first being truncated (\*(L"clobbered\*(R") and nonexisting files newly created.
If \s-1MODE\s0 is \f(CW\*(C`>>\*(C'\fR, the file is opened for appending, again being
created if necessary.
.Sp
You can put a \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR in front of the \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR to
indicate that you want both read and write access to the file; thus
\&\f(CW\*(C`+<\*(C'\fR is almost always preferred for read/write updates\*(--the 
\&\f(CW\*(C`+>\*(C'\fR mode would clobber the file first.  You can't usually use
either read-write mode for updating textfiles, since they have
variable-length records.  See the \fB\-i\fR switch in perlrun for a
better approach.  The file is created with permissions of \f(CW0666\fR
modified by the process's \f(CW\*(C`umask\*(C'\fR value.
.Sp
These various prefixes correspond to the \fIfopen\fR\|(3) modes of \f(CW\*(C`r\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`r+\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`w\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`w+\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`a+\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
In the one\- and two-argument forms of the call, the mode and filename
should be concatenated (in that order), preferably separated by white
space.  You can\*(--but shouldn't\*(--omit the mode in these forms when that mode
is \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR.  It is always safe to use the two-argument form of \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR if
the filename argument is a known literal.
.Sp
For three or more arguments if \s-1MODE\s0 is \f(CW\*(C`|\-\*(C'\fR, the filename is
interpreted as a command to which output is to be piped, and if \s-1MODE\s0
is \f(CW\*(C`\-|\*(C'\fR, the filename is interpreted as a command that pipes
output to us.  In the two-argument (and one-argument) form, one should
replace dash (\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR) with the command.
See \*(L"Using \fIopen()\fR for \s-1IPC\*(R"\s0 in perlipc for more examples of this.
(You are not allowed to \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR to a command that pipes both in \fIand\fR
out, but see IPC::Open2, IPC::Open3, and
\&\*(L"Bidirectional Communication with Another Process\*(R" in perlipc for
alternatives.)
.Sp
In the form of pipe opens taking three or more arguments, if \s-1LIST\s0 is specified
(extra arguments after the command name) then \s-1LIST\s0 becomes arguments
to the command invoked if the platform supports it.  The meaning of
\&\f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR with more than three arguments for non-pipe modes is not yet
defined, but experimental \*(L"layers\*(R" may give extra \s-1LIST\s0 arguments
meaning.
.Sp
In the two-argument (and one-argument) form, opening \f(CW\*(C`<\-\*(C'\fR 
or \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR opens \s-1STDIN\s0 and opening \f(CW\*(C`>\-\*(C'\fR opens \s-1STDOUT.\s0
.Sp
You may (and usually should) use the three-argument form of open to specify
I/O layers (sometimes referred to as \*(L"disciplines\*(R") to apply to the handle
that affect how the input and output are processed (see open and
PerlIO for more details).  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  open(my $fh, "<:encoding(UTF\-8)", "filename")
\&    || die "can\*(Aqt open UTF\-8 encoded filename: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
opens the UTF8\-encoded file containing Unicode characters;
see perluniintro.  Note that if layers are specified in the
three-argument form, then default layers stored in ${^OPEN} (see perlvar;
usually set by the \fBopen\fR pragma or the switch \fB\-CioD\fR) are ignored.
Those layers will also be ignored if you specifying a colon with no name
following it.  In that case the default layer for the operating system
(:raw on Unix, :crlf on Windows) is used.
.Sp
Open returns nonzero on success, the undefined value otherwise.  If
the \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR involved a pipe, the return value happens to be the pid of
the subprocess.
.Sp
If you're running Perl on a system that distinguishes between text
files and binary files, then you should check out \*(L"binmode\*(R" for tips
for dealing with this.  The key distinction between systems that need
\&\f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR and those that don't is their text file formats.  Systems
like Unix, Mac \s-1OS,\s0 and Plan 9, that end lines with a single
character and encode that character in C as \f(CW"\en"\fR do not
need \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR.  The rest need it.
.Sp
When opening a file, it's seldom a good idea to continue 
if the request failed, so \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR is frequently used with
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.  Even if \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR won't do what you want (say, in a \s-1CGI\s0 script,
where you want to format a suitable error message (but there are
modules that can help with that problem)) always check
the return value from opening a file.
.Sp
As a special case the three-argument form with a read/write mode and the third
argument being \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    open(my $tmp, "+>", undef) or die ...
.Ve
.Sp
opens a filehandle to an anonymous temporary file.  Also using \f(CW\*(C`+<\*(C'\fR
works for symmetry, but you really should consider writing something
to the temporary file first.  You will need to \fIseek()\fR to do the
reading.
.Sp
Perl is built using PerlIO by default; Unless you've
changed this (such as building Perl with \f(CW\*(C`Configure \-Uuseperlio\*(C'\fR), you can
open filehandles directly to Perl scalars via:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    open($fh, ">", \e$variable) || ..
.Ve
.Sp

You may also, in the Bourne shell tradition, specify an \s-1EXPR\s0 beginning
with \f(CW\*(C`>&\*(C'\fR, in which case the rest of the string is interpreted
as the name of a filehandle (or file descriptor, if numeric) to be
duped (as \f(CWdup(2)\fR) and opened.  You may use \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR after \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`>>\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`+>\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`+>>\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`+<\*(C'\fR.
The mode you specify should match the mode of the original filehandle.
(Duping a filehandle does not take into account any existing contents
of \s-1IO\s0 buffers.)  If you use the three-argument
form, then you can pass either a
number, the name of a filehandle, or the normal \*(L"reference to a glob\*(R".
.Sp
Here is a script that saves, redirects, and restores \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR using various methods:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
\&    open(my $oldout, ">&STDOUT")     or die "Can\*(Aqt dup STDOUT: $!";
\&    open(OLDERR,     ">&", \e*STDERR) or die "Can\*(Aqt dup STDERR: $!";
\&
\&    open(STDOUT, \*(Aq>\*(Aq, "foo.out") or die "Can\*(Aqt redirect STDOUT: $!";
\&    open(STDERR, ">&STDOUT")     or die "Can\*(Aqt dup STDOUT: $!";
\&
\&    select STDERR; $| = 1;  # make unbuffered
\&    select STDOUT; $| = 1;  # make unbuffered
\&
\&    print STDOUT "stdout 1\en";  # this works for
\&    print STDERR "stderr 1\en";  # subprocesses too
\&
\&    open(STDOUT, ">&", $oldout) or die "Can\*(Aqt dup \e$oldout: $!";
\&    open(STDERR, ">&OLDERR")    or die "Can\*(Aqt dup OLDERR: $!";
\&
\&    print STDOUT "stdout 2\en";
\&    print STDERR "stderr 2\en";
.Ve
.Sp
If you specify \f(CW\*(Aq<&=X\*(Aq\fR, where \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR is a file descriptor number
or a filehandle, then Perl will do an equivalent of C's \f(CW\*(C`fdopen\*(C'\fR of
that file descriptor (and not call \f(CWdup(2)\fR); this is more
parsimonious of file descriptors.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # open for input, reusing the fileno of $fd
\&    open(FILEHANDLE, "<&=$fd")
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    open(FILEHANDLE, "<&=", $fd)
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # open for append, using the fileno of OLDFH
\&    open(FH, ">>&=", OLDFH)
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    open(FH, ">>&=OLDFH")
.Ve
.Sp
Being parsimonious on filehandles is also useful (besides being
parsimonious) for example when something is dependent on file
descriptors, like for example locking using \fIflock()\fR.  If you do just
\&\f(CW\*(C`open(A, ">>&B")\*(C'\fR, the filehandle A will not have the same file
descriptor as B, and therefore flock(A) will not flock(B) nor vice
versa.  But with \f(CW\*(C`open(A, ">>&=B")\*(C'\fR, the filehandles will share
the same underlying system file descriptor.
.Sp
Note that under Perls older than 5.8.0, Perl uses the standard C library's'
\&\fIfdopen()\fR to implement the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR functionality.  On many Unix systems,
\&\fIfdopen()\fR fails when file descriptors exceed a certain value, typically 255.
For Perls 5.8.0 and later, PerlIO is (most often) the default.
.Sp
You can see whether your Perl was built with PerlIO by running \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR
and looking for the \f(CW\*(C`useperlio=\*(C'\fR line.  If \f(CW\*(C`useperlio\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`define\*(C'\fR, you
have PerlIO; otherwise you don't.
.Sp
If you open a pipe on the command \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR (that is, specify either \f(CW\*(C`|\-\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-|\*(C'\fR
with the one\- or two-argument forms of \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR), 
an implicit \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR is done, so \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR returns twice: in the parent
process it returns the pid
of the child process, and in the child process it returns (a defined) \f(CW0\fR.
Use \f(CW\*(C`defined($pid)\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR to determine whether the open was successful.
.Sp
For example, use either
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $child_pid = open(FROM_KID, "\-|")   // die "can\*(Aqt fork: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $child_pid = open(TO_KID,   "|\-")   // die "can\*(Aqt fork: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
followed by
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    if ($child_pid) {
\&        # am the parent:
\&        # either write TO_KID or else read FROM_KID
\&        ...
\&       waitpid $child_pid, 0;
\&    } else {
\&        # am the child; use STDIN/STDOUT normally
\&        ...
\&        exit;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
The filehandle behaves normally for the parent, but I/O to that
filehandle is piped from/to the \s-1STDOUT/STDIN\s0 of the child process.
In the child process, the filehandle isn't opened\*(--I/O happens from/to
the new \s-1STDOUT/STDIN. \s0 Typically this is used like the normal
piped open when you want to exercise more control over just how the
pipe command gets executed, such as when running setuid and
you don't want to have to scan shell commands for metacharacters.
.Sp
The following blocks are more or less equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    open(FOO, "|tr \*(Aq[a\-z]\*(Aq \*(Aq[A\-Z]\*(Aq");
\&    open(FOO, "|\-", "tr \*(Aq[a\-z]\*(Aq \*(Aq[A\-Z]\*(Aq");
\&    open(FOO, "|\-") || exec \*(Aqtr\*(Aq, \*(Aq[a\-z]\*(Aq, \*(Aq[A\-Z]\*(Aq;
\&    open(FOO, "|\-", "tr", \*(Aq[a\-z]\*(Aq, \*(Aq[A\-Z]\*(Aq);
\&
\&    open(FOO, "cat \-n \*(Aq$file\*(Aq|");
\&    open(FOO, "\-|", "cat \-n \*(Aq$file\*(Aq");
\&    open(FOO, "\-|") || exec "cat", "\-n", $file;
\&    open(FOO, "\-|", "cat", "\-n", $file);
.Ve
.Sp
The last two examples in each block show the pipe as \*(L"list form\*(R", which is
not yet supported on all platforms.  A good rule of thumb is that if
your platform has a real \f(CW\*(C`fork()\*(C'\fR (in other words, if your platform is
Unix, including Linux and MacOS X), you can use the list form.  You would 
want to use the list form of the pipe so you can pass literal arguments
to the command without risk of the shell interpreting any shell metacharacters
in them.  However, this also bars you from opening pipes to commands
that intentionally contain shell metacharacters, such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    open(FOO, "|cat \-n | expand \-4 | lpr")
\&        // die "Can\*(Aqt open pipeline to lpr: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
See \*(L"Safe Pipe Opens\*(R" in perlipc for more examples of this.
.Sp
Perl will attempt to flush all files opened for
output before any operation that may do a fork, but this may not be
supported on some platforms (see perlport).  To be safe, you may need
to set \f(CW$|\fR ($AUTOFLUSH in English) or call the \f(CW\*(C`autoflush()\*(C'\fR method
of \f(CW\*(C`IO::Handle\*(C'\fR on any open handles.
.Sp
On systems that support a close-on-exec flag on files, the flag will
be set for the newly opened file descriptor as determined by the value
of \f(CW$^F\fR.  See \*(L"$^F\*(R" in perlvar.
.Sp
Closing any piped filehandle causes the parent process to wait for the
child to finish, then returns the status value in \f(CW$?\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The filename passed to the one\- and two-argument forms of \fIopen()\fR will
have leading and trailing whitespace deleted and normal
redirection characters honored.  This property, known as \*(L"magic open\*(R",
can often be used to good effect.  A user could specify a filename of
\&\fI\*(L"rsh cat file |\*(R"\fR, or you could change certain filenames as needed:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $filename =~ s/(.*\e.gz)\es*$/gzip \-dc < $1|/;
\&    open(FH, $filename) or die "Can\*(Aqt open $filename: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
Use the three-argument form to open a file with arbitrary weird characters in it,
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    open(FOO, "<", $file)
\&        || die "can\*(Aqt open < $file: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
otherwise it's necessary to protect any leading and trailing whitespace:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $file =~ s#^(\es)#./$1#;
\&    open(FOO, "< $file\e0")
\&        || die "open failed: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
(this may not work on some bizarre filesystems).  One should
conscientiously choose between the \fImagic\fR and \fIthree-argument\fR form
of \fIopen()\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    open(IN, $ARGV[0]) || die "can\*(Aqt open $ARGV[0]: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
will allow the user to specify an argument of the form \f(CW"rsh cat file |"\fR,
but will not work on a filename that happens to have a trailing space, while
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    open(IN, "<", $ARGV[0])
\&        || die "can\*(Aqt open < $ARGV[0]: $!";
.Ve
.Sp
will have exactly the opposite restrictions.
.Sp
If you want a \*(L"real\*(R" C \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR (see \fIopen\fR\|(2) on your system), then you
should use the \f(CW\*(C`sysopen\*(C'\fR function, which involves no such magic (but may
use subtly different filemodes than Perl \fIopen()\fR, which is mapped to C
\&\fIfopen()\fR).  This is another way to protect your filenames from
interpretation.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    use IO::Handle;
\&    sysopen(HANDLE, $path, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL)
\&        or die "sysopen $path: $!";
\&    $oldfh = select(HANDLE); $| = 1; select($oldfh);
\&    print HANDLE "stuff $$\en";
\&    seek(HANDLE, 0, 0);
\&    print "File contains: ", <HANDLE>;
.Ve
.Sp
Using the constructor from the \f(CW\*(C`IO::Handle\*(C'\fR package (or one of its
subclasses, such as \f(CW\*(C`IO::File\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`IO::Socket\*(C'\fR), you can generate anonymous
filehandles that have the scope of the variables used to hold them, then
automatically (but silently) close once their reference counts become
zero, typically at scope exit:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    use IO::File;
\&    #...
\&    sub read_myfile_munged {
\&        my $ALL = shift;
\&        # or just leave it undef to autoviv
\&        my $handle = IO::File\->new;
\&        open($handle, "<", "myfile") or die "myfile: $!";
\&        $first = <$handle>
\&            or return ();     # Automatically closed here.
\&        mung($first) or die "mung failed";  # Or here.
\&        return (first, <$handle>) if $ALL;  # Or here.
\&        return $first;                      # Or here.
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1WARNING:\s0\fR The previous example has a bug because the automatic

\&\f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR makes a lexical alias to a package variable of the same name in the current
package for use within the current lexical scope.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR has the same scoping rules as \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR, but \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR only
declares an alias, whereas \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR both declare a variable name and
allocate storage for that name within the current scope.
.Sp
This means that when \f(CW\*(C`use strict \*(Aqvars\*(Aq\*(C'\fR is in effect, \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR lets you use
a package variable without qualifying it with the package name, but only within
the lexical scope of the \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR declaration.  In this way, \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR differs from
\&\f(CW\*(C`use vars\*(C'\fR, which allows use of an unqualified name \fIonly\fR within the
affected package, but across scopes.

An \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR declaration declares an alias for a package variable that will be visible
across its entire lexical scope, even across package boundaries.  The
package in which the variable is entered is determined at the point
of the declaration, not at the point of use.  This means the following
behavior holds:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    package Foo;
\&    our $bar;      # declares $Foo::bar for rest of lexical scope
\&    $bar = 20;

.Ve
.Sp
Multiple \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR declarations with the same name in the same lexical
scope are allowed if they are in different packages.  If they happen
to be in the same package, Perl will emit warnings if you have asked
for them, just like multiple \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR declarations.  Unlike a second
\&\f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR declaration, which will bind the name to a fresh variable, a
second \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR declaration in the same package, in the same scope, is
merely redundant.

from Perl 5.8.0, also via the \f(CW\*(C`Attribute::Handlers\*(C'\fR module.  See

One can replace a numeric repeat count with a template letter enclosed in
brackets to use the packed byte length of the bracketed template for the
repeat count.
.Sp
For example, the template \f(CW\*(C`x[L]\*(C'\fR skips as many bytes as in a packed long,
and the template \f(CW"$t X[$t] $t"\fR unpacks twice whatever \f(CW$t\fR (when
variable-expanded) unpacks.  If the template in brackets contains alignment
commands (such as \f(CW\*(C`x![d]\*(C'\fR), its packed length is calculated as if the
start of the template had the maximal possible alignment.
.Sp
When used with \f(CW\*(C`Z\*(C'\fR, a \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR as the repeat count is guaranteed to add a
trailing null byte, so the resulting string is always one byte longer than
the byte length of the item itself.
.Sp
When used with \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR, the repeat count represents an offset from the start
of the innermost \f(CW\*(C`()\*(C'\fR group.
.Sp
When used with \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR, the repeat count determines the starting position to
calculate the value offset as follows:
.IP "\(bu" 4
If the repeat count is \f(CW0\fR, it's relative to the current position.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If the repeat count is \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR, the offset is relative to the start of the

.IP "\(bu" 4
And if it's an integer \fIn\fR, the offset is relative to the start of the

bigger then the group level.

The repeat count for \f(CW\*(C`u\*(C'\fR is interpreted as the maximal number of bytes

The \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`Z\*(C'\fR types gobble just one value, but pack it as a
string of length count, padding with nulls or spaces as needed.  When
unpacking, \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR strips trailing whitespace and nulls, \f(CW\*(C`Z\*(C'\fR strips everything
after the first null, and \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR returns data with no stripping at all.
.Sp
If the value to pack is too long, the result is truncated.  If it's too
long and an explicit count is provided, \f(CW\*(C`Z\*(C'\fR packs only \f(CW\*(C`$count\-1\*(C'\fR bytes,
followed by a null byte.  Thus \f(CW\*(C`Z\*(C'\fR always packs a trailing null, except
when the count is 0.

Likewise, the \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR formats pack a string that's that many bits long.
Each such format generates 1 bit of the result.  These are typically followed
by a repeat count like \f(CW\*(C`B8\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`B64\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Each result bit is based on the least-significant bit of the corresponding
input character, i.e., on \f(CW\*(C`ord($char)%2\*(C'\fR.  In particular, characters \f(CW"0"\fR
and \f(CW"1"\fR generate bits 0 and 1, as do characters \f(CW"\e000"\fR and \f(CW"\e001"\fR.
.Sp
Starting from the beginning of the input string, each 8\-tuple
of characters is converted to 1 character of output.  With format \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR,
the first character of the 8\-tuple determines the least-significant bit of a
character; with format \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR, it determines the most-significant bit of
a character.
.Sp
If the length of the input string is not evenly divisible by 8, the
remainder is packed as if the input string were padded by null characters
at the end.  Similarly during unpacking, \*(L"extra\*(R" bits are ignored.
.Sp
If the input string is longer than needed, remaining characters are ignored.
.Sp
A \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR for the repeat count uses all characters of the input field.

The \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`H\*(C'\fR formats pack a string that many nybbles (4\-bit groups,

.Sp
For each such format, \fIpack()\fR generates 4 bits of result.
With non-alphabetical characters, the result is based on the 4 least-significant
bits of the input character, i.e., on \f(CW\*(C`ord($char)%16\*(C'\fR.  In particular,
characters \f(CW"0"\fR and \f(CW"1"\fR generate nybbles 0 and 1, as do bytes
\&\f(CW"\e000"\fR and \f(CW"\e001"\fR.  For characters \f(CW"a".."f"\fR and \f(CW"A".."F"\fR, the result
is compatible with the usual hexadecimal digits, so that \f(CW"a"\fR and
\&\f(CW"A"\fR both generate the nybble \f(CW\*(C`0xA==10\*(C'\fR.  Use only these specific hex 
characters with this format.
.Sp
Starting from the beginning of the template to \fIpack()\fR, each pair
of characters is converted to 1 character of output.  With format \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR, the
first character of the pair determines the least-significant nybble of the
output character; with format \f(CW\*(C`H\*(C'\fR, it determines the most-significant
nybble.
.Sp
If the length of the input string is not even, it behaves as if padded by
a null character at the end.  Similarly, \*(L"extra\*(R" nybbles are ignored during
unpacking.

The \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR format packs a pointer to a null-terminated string.  You are
responsible for ensuring that the string is not a temporary value, as that
could potentially get deallocated before you got around to using the packed
result.  The \f(CW\*(C`P\*(C'\fR format packs a pointer to a structure of the size indicated
by the length.  A null pointer is created if the corresponding value for
\&\f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`P\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR; similarly with \fIunpack()\fR, where a null pointer
unpacks into \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If your system has a strange pointer size\*(--meaning a pointer is neither as
big as an int nor as big as a long\*(--it may not be possible to pack or
unpack pointers in big\- or little-endian byte order.  Attempting to do
so raises an exception.

The \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR template character allows packing and unpacking of a sequence of
items where the packed structure contains a packed item count followed by
the packed items themselves.  This is useful when the structure you're

within the structure itself as separate fields.
.Sp
For \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR, you write \fIlength-item\fR\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR\fIsequence-item\fR, and the
\&\fIlength-item\fR describes how the length value is packed.  Formats likely
to be of most use are integer-packing ones like \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR for Java strings,
\&\f(CW\*(C`w\*(C'\fR for \s-1ASN.1\s0 or \s-1SNMP,\s0 and \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR for Sun \s-1XDR.\s0
.Sp
For \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR, \fIsequence-item\fR may have a repeat count, in which case
the minimum of that and the number of available items is used as the argument
for \fIlength-item\fR.  If it has no repeat count or uses a '*', the number
of available items is used.
.Sp
For \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR, an internal stack of integer arguments unpacked so far is
used.  You write \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR\fIsequence-item\fR and the repeat count is obtained by
popping off the last element from the stack.  The \fIsequence-item\fR must not
have a repeat count.
.Sp
If \fIsequence-item\fR refers to a string type (\f(CW"A"\fR, \f(CW"a"\fR, or \f(CW"Z"\fR),
the \fIlength-item\fR is the string length, not the number of strings.  With
an explicit repeat count for pack, the packed string is adjusted to that
length.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1

Declares the \s-1BLOCK\s0 or the rest of the compilation unit as being in the
given namespace.  The scope of the package declaration is either the
supplied code \s-1BLOCK\s0 or, in the absence of a \s-1BLOCK,\s0 from the declaration
itself through the end of current scope (the enclosing block, file, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR).  That is, the forms without a \s-1BLOCK\s0 are operative through the end
of the current scope, just like the \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR operators.
All unqualified dynamic identifiers in this scope will be in the given
namespace, except where overridden by another \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR declaration or
when they're one of the special identifiers that qualify into \f(CW\*(C`main::\*(C'\fR,
like \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ARGV\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ENV\*(C'\fR, and the punctuation variables.

A package statement affects dynamic variables only, including those
you've used \f(CW\*(C`local\*(C'\fR on, but \fInot\fR lexically-scoped variables, which are created
with \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR.  Typically it would be the first 
declaration in a file included by \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR.  You can switch into a
package in more than one place, since this only determines which default 
symbol table the compiler uses for the rest of that block.  You can refer to
identifiers in other packages than the current one by prefixing the identifier
with the package name and a double colon, as in \f(CW$SomePack::var\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`ThatPack::INPUT_HANDLE\*(C'\fR.  If package name is omitted, the \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR
package as assumed.  That is, \f(CW$::sail\fR is equivalent to
\&\f(CW$main::sail\fR (as well as to \f(CW\*(C`$main\*(Aqsail\*(C'\fR, still seen in ancient

If \s-1VERSION\s0 is provided, \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR sets the \f(CW$VERSION\fR variable in the given

To avoid confusing would-be users of your code who are running earlier

Returns the offset of where the last \f(CW\*(C`m//g\*(C'\fR search left off for the
variable in question (\f(CW$_\fR is used when the variable is not
specified).  Note that 0 is a valid match offset.  \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR indicates
that the search position is reset (usually due to match failure, but
can also be because no match has yet been run on the scalar).
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`pos\*(C'\fR directly accesses the location used by the regexp engine to
store the offset, so assigning to \f(CW\*(C`pos\*(C'\fR will change that offset, and
so will also influence the \f(CW\*(C`\eG\*(C'\fR zero-width assertion in regular
expressions.  Both of these effects take place for the next match, so
you can't affect the position with \f(CW\*(C`pos\*(C'\fR during the current match,
such as in \f(CW\*(C`(?{pos() = 5})\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`s//pos() = 5/e\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Setting \f(CW\*(C`pos\*(C'\fR also resets the \fImatched with zero-length\fR flag, described
under \*(L"Repeated Patterns Matching a Zero-length Substring\*(R" in perlre.
.Sp
Because a failed \f(CW\*(C`m//gc\*(C'\fR match doesn't reset the offset, the return

\&\s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 is a variable and the next token is a term, it may be
misinterpreted as an operator unless you interpose a \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR or put
parentheses around the arguments.)  If \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 is omitted, prints to the
last selected (see \*(L"select\*(R") output handle.  If \s-1LIST\s0 is omitted, prints
\&\f(CW$_\fR to the currently selected output handle.  To use \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 alone to
print the content of \f(CW$_\fR to it, you must use a real filehandle like
\&\f(CW\*(C`FH\*(C'\fR, not an indirect one like \f(CW$fh\fR.  To set the default output handle
to something other than \s-1STDOUT,\s0 use the select operation.
.Sp
The current value of \f(CW$,\fR (if any) is printed between each \s-1LIST\s0 item.  The
current value of \f(CW\*(C`$\e\*(C'\fR (if any) is printed after the entire \s-1LIST\s0 has been
printed.  Because print takes a \s-1LIST,\s0 anything in the \s-1LIST\s0 is evaluated in
list context, including any subroutines whose return lists you pass to
\&\f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR.  Be careful not to follow the print keyword with a left
parenthesis unless you want the corresponding right parenthesis to
terminate the arguments to the print; put parentheses around all arguments
(or interpose a \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR, but that doesn't look as good).
.Sp
If you're storing handles in an array or hash, or in general whenever
you're using any expression more complex than a bareword handle or a plain,
unsubscripted scalar variable to retrieve it, you will have to use a block
returning the filehandle value instead, in which case the \s-1LIST\s0 may not be
omitted:

\&\s-1LIST\s0 are actually parsed as a single list.  The first argument
of the list will be interpreted as the \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR format.  This
means that \f(CW\*(C`printf(@_)\*(C'\fR will use \f(CW$_[0]\fR as the format.  See
sprintf for an
explanation of the format argument.  If \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR (including

separator in formatted floating-point numbers is affected by the \s-1LC_NUMERIC\s0
locale setting.  See perllocale and \s-1POSIX\s0.
.Sp
For historical reasons, if you omit the list, \f(CW$_\fR is used as the format;
to use \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 without a list, you must use a real filehandle like
\&\f(CW\*(C`FH\*(C'\fR, not an indirect one like \f(CW$fh\fR.  However, this will rarely do what
you want; if \f(CW$_\fR contains formatting codes, they will be replaced with the
empty string and a warning will be emitted if warnings are enabled.  Just
use \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR if you want to print the contents of \f(CW$_\fR.
.Sp
Don't fall into the trap of using a \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR when a simple

.Sp
In Perl v5.14, all non-ASCII characters are quoted in non\-UTF\-8\-encoded
strings, but not quoted in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 strings.
.Sp
Starting in Perl v5.16, Perl adopted a Unicode-defined strategy for
quoting non-ASCII characters; the quoting of \s-1ASCII\s0 characters is
unchanged.
.Sp
Also unchanged is the quoting of non\-UTF\-8 strings when outside the
scope of a \f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq\*(C'\fR, which is to quote all
characters in the upper Latin1 range.  This provides complete backwards
compatibility for old programs which do not use Unicode.  (Note that
\&\f(CW\*(C`unicode_strings\*(C'\fR is automatically enabled within the scope of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`use\ v5.12\*(C'\fR or greater.)
.Sp
Within the scope of \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR, all non-ASCII Latin1 code points
are quoted whether the string is encoded as \s-1UTF\-8\s0 or not.  As mentioned
above, locale does not affect the quoting of ASCII-range characters.
This protects against those locales where characters such as \f(CW"|"\fR are
considered to be word characters.
.Sp
Otherwise, Perl quotes non-ASCII characters using an adaptation from
Unicode (see <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/>).
The only code points that are quoted are those that have any of the
Unicode properties:  Pattern_Syntax, Pattern_White_Space, White_Space,
Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, or General_Category=Control.
.Sp
Of these properties, the two important ones are Pattern_Syntax and
Pattern_White_Space.  They have been set up by Unicode for exactly this
purpose of deciding which characters in a regular expression pattern
should be quoted.  No character that can be in an identifier has these
properties.
.Sp
Perl promises, that if we ever add regular expression pattern
metacharacters to the dozen already defined
(\f(CW\*(C`\e | ( ) [ { ^ $ * + ? .\*(C'\fR), that we will only use ones that have the
Pattern_Syntax property.  Perl also promises, that if we ever add
characters that are considered to be white space in regular expressions
(currently mostly affected by \f(CW\*(C`/x\*(C'\fR), they will all have the
Pattern_White_Space property.
.Sp
Unicode promises that the set of code points that have these two
properties will never change, so something that is not quoted in v5.16
will never need to be quoted in any future Perl release.  (Not all the
code points that match Pattern_Syntax have actually had characters
assigned to them; so there is room to grow, but they are quoted
whether assigned or not.  Perl, of course, would never use an
unassigned code point as an actual metacharacter.)
.Sp
Quoting characters that have the other 3 properties is done to enhance
the readability of the regular expression and not because they actually
need to be quoted for regular expression purposes (characters with the
White_Space property are likely to be indistinguishable on the page or
screen from those with the Pattern_White_Space property; and the other
two properties contain non-printing characters).

Reads from the filehandle whose typeglob is contained in \s-1EXPR \s0(or from

returns the next line until end-of-file is reached, whereupon the

\&\s-1VERSION\s0 may be either a numeric argument such as 5.006, which will be

Otherwise, \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR demands that a library file be included if it

mechanism, which is essentially just a variety of \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR with the
caveat that lexical variables in the invoking script will be invisible
to the included code.  Has semantics similar to the following subroutine:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    sub require {
\&       my ($filename) = @_;
\&       if (exists $INC{$filename}) {
\&           return 1 if $INC{$filename};

\&                   $INC{$filename} = $realfilename;

\&                   last ITER;

\&           }

\&       } elsif (!$result) {
\&           delete $INC{$filename};
\&           die "$filename did not return true value";
\&       } else {
\&           return $result;
\&       }
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Note that the file will not be included twice under the same specified
name.
.Sp
The file must return true as the last statement to indicate
successful execution of any initialization code, so it's customary to
end such a file with \f(CW\*(C`1;\*(C'\fR unless you're sure it'll return true
otherwise.  But it's better just to put the \f(CW\*(C`1;\*(C'\fR, in case you add more
statements.
.Sp
If \s-1EXPR\s0 is a bareword, the require assumes a "\fI.pm\fR\*(L" extension and
replaces \*(R"\fI::\fR\*(L" with \*(R"\fI/\fR" in the filename for you,
to make it easy to load standard modules.  This form of loading of
modules does not risk altering your namespace.
.Sp
In other words, if you try this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        require Foo::Bar;     # a splendid bareword
.Ve
.Sp
The require function will actually look for the "\fIFoo/Bar.pm\fR" file in the
directories specified in the \f(CW@INC\fR array.
.Sp
But if you try this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        $class = \*(AqFoo::Bar\*(Aq;
\&        require $class;       # $class is not a bareword
\&    #or
\&        require "Foo::Bar";   # not a bareword because of the ""
.Ve
.Sp
The require function will look for the "\fIFoo::Bar\fR\*(L" file in the \f(CW@INC\fR array and
will complain about not finding \*(R"\fIFoo::Bar\fR" there.  In this case you can do:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        eval "require $class";
.Ve
.Sp
Now that you understand how \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR looks for files with a
bareword argument, there is a little extra functionality going on behind
the scenes.  Before \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR looks for a "\fI.pm\fR\*(L" extension, it will
first look for a similar filename with a \*(R"\fI.pmc\fR\*(L" extension.  If this file
is found, it will be loaded in place of any file ending in a \*(R"\fI.pm\fR"
extension.
.Sp
You can also insert hooks into the import facility by putting Perl code
directly into the \f(CW@INC\fR array.  There are three forms of hooks: subroutine
references, array references, and blessed objects.
.Sp
Subroutine references are the simplest case.  When the inclusion system
walks through \f(CW@INC\fR and encounters a subroutine, this subroutine gets
called with two parameters, the first a reference to itself, and the
second the name of the file to be included (e.g., "\fIFoo/Bar.pm\fR").  The
subroutine should return either nothing or else a list of up to three 
values in the following order:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
A filehandle, from which the file will be read.
.IP "2." 4
A reference to a subroutine.  If there is no filehandle (previous item),
then this subroutine is expected to generate one line of source code per
call, writing the line into \f(CW$_\fR and returning 1, then finally at end of
file returning 0.  If there is a filehandle, then the subroutine will be
called to act as a simple source filter, with the line as read in \f(CW$_\fR.
Again, return 1 for each valid line, and 0 after all lines have been
returned.
.IP "3." 4
Optional state for the subroutine.  The state is passed in as \f(CW$_[1]\fR.  A
reference to the subroutine itself is passed in as \f(CW$_[0]\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If an empty list, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, or nothing that matches the first 3 values above
is returned, then \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR looks at the remaining elements of \f(CW@INC\fR.
Note that this filehandle must be a real filehandle (strictly a typeglob
or reference to a typeglob, whether blessed or unblessed); tied filehandles 
will be ignored and processing will stop there.
.Sp
If the hook is an array reference, its first element must be a subroutine
reference.  This subroutine is called as above, but the first parameter is
the array reference.  This lets you indirectly pass arguments to
the subroutine.
.Sp
In other words, you can write:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    push @INC, \e&my_sub;
\&    sub my_sub {
\&        my ($coderef, $filename) = @_;  # $coderef is \e&my_sub
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
or:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    push @INC, [ \e&my_sub, $x, $y, ... ];
\&    sub my_sub {
\&        my ($arrayref, $filename) = @_;
\&        # Retrieve $x, $y, ...
\&        my @parameters = @$arrayref[1..$#$arrayref];
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
If the hook is an object, it must provide an \s-1INC\s0 method that will be
called as above, the first parameter being the object itself.  (Note that
you must fully qualify the sub's name, as unqualified \f(CW\*(C`INC\*(C'\fR is always forced
into package \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR.)  Here is a typical code layout:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    # In Foo.pm
\&    package Foo;
\&    sub new { ... }
\&    sub Foo::INC {
\&        my ($self, $filename) = @_;
\&        ...
\&    }
\&
\&    # In the main program
\&    push @INC, Foo\->new(...);

corresponding to the files they have loaded.  See \*(L"%INC\*(R" in perlvar.

.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @counts = ( scalar @a, scalar @b, scalar @c );
.Ve
.Sp
There is no equivalent operator to force an expression to
be interpolated in list context because in practice, this is never
needed.  If you really wanted to do so, however, you could use
the construction \f(CW\*(C`@{[ (some expression) ]}\*(C'\fR, but usually a simple
\&\f(CW\*(C`(some expression)\*(C'\fR suffices.
.Sp
Because \f(CW\*(C`scalar\*(C'\fR is a unary operator, if you accidentally use a
parenthesized list for the \s-1EXPR,\s0 this behaves as a scalar comma expression,
evaluating all but the last element in void context and returning the final
element evaluated in scalar context.  This is seldom what you want.
.Sp
The following single statement:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print uc(scalar(&foo,$bar)),$baz;
.Ve

is the moral equivalent of these two:

.IP "seek \s-1FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE \s0" 4
.IX Xref "seek fseek filehandle, position"
.IX Item "seek FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE "
Sets \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0's position, just like the \f(CW\*(C`fseek\*(C'\fR call of \f(CW\*(C`stdio\*(C'\fR.
\&\s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 may be an expression whose value gives the name of the
filehandle.  The values for \s-1WHENCE\s0 are \f(CW0\fR to set the new position
\&\fIin bytes\fR to \s-1POSITION\s0; \f(CW1\fR to set it to the current position plus
\&\s-1POSITION\s0; and \f(CW2\fR to set it to \s-1EOF\s0 plus \s-1POSITION,\s0 typically
negative.  For \s-1WHENCE\s0 you may use the constants \f(CW\*(C`SEEK_SET\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`SEEK_CUR\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`SEEK_END\*(C'\fR (start of the file, current position, end
of the file) from the Fcntl module.  Returns \f(CW1\fR on success, false
otherwise.
.Sp
Note the \fIin bytes\fR: even if the filehandle has been set to
operate on characters (for example by using the \f(CW\*(C`:encoding(utf8)\*(C'\fR open
layer), \fItell()\fR will return byte offsets, not character offsets
(because implementing that would render \fIseek()\fR and \fItell()\fR rather slow).
.Sp
If you want to position the file for \f(CW\*(C`sysread\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`syswrite\*(C'\fR, don't use
\&\f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR, because buffering makes its effect on the file's read-write position
unpredictable and non-portable.  Use \f(CW\*(C`sysseek\*(C'\fR instead.
.Sp
Due to the rules and rigors of \s-1ANSI C,\s0 on some systems you have to do a
seek whenever you switch between reading and writing.  Amongst other
things, this may have the effect of calling stdio's \fIclearerr\fR\|(3).
A \s-1WHENCE\s0 of \f(CW1\fR (\f(CW\*(C`SEEK_CUR\*(C'\fR) is useful for not moving the file position:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    seek(TEST,0,1);
.Ve
.Sp
This is also useful for applications emulating \f(CW\*(C`tail \-f\*(C'\fR.  Once you hit
\&\s-1EOF\s0 on your read and then sleep for a while, you (probably) have to stick in a
dummy \fIseek()\fR to reset things.  The \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR doesn't change the position,
but it \fIdoes\fR clear the end-of-file condition on the handle, so that the
next \f(CW\*(C`<FILE>\*(C'\fR makes Perl try again to read something.  (We hope.)
.Sp
If that doesn't work (some I/O implementations are particularly
cantankerous), you might need something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    for (;;) {
\&        for ($curpos = tell(FILE); $_ = <FILE>;
\&             $curpos = tell(FILE)) {
\&            # search for some stuff and put it into files
\&        }

.IP "seekdir \s-1DIRHANDLE,POS \s0" 4
.IX Xref "seekdir"
.IX Item "seekdir DIRHANDLE,POS "
Sets the current position for the \f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR routine on \s-1DIRHANDLE.  POS\s0
must be a value returned by \f(CW\*(C`telldir\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`seekdir\*(C'\fR also has the same caveats
about possible directory compaction as the corresponding system library
routine.

.PD 0
.IP "select" 4
.IX Item "select"
.PD
Returns the currently selected filehandle.  If \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 is supplied,
sets the new current default filehandle for output.  This has two
effects: first, a \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR without a filehandle 
default to this \s-1FILEHANDLE. \s0 Second, references to variables related to
output will refer to this output channel.
.Sp
For example, to set the top-of-form format for more than one
output channel, you might do the following:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    select(REPORT1);
\&    $^ = \*(Aqreport1_top\*(Aq;
\&    select(REPORT2);
\&    $^ = \*(Aqreport2_top\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
\&\s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 may be an expression whose value gives the name of the
actual filehandle.  Thus:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $oldfh = select(STDERR); $| = 1; select($oldfh);
.Ve
.Sp
Some programmers may prefer to think of filehandles as objects with
methods, preferring to write the last example as:

This calls the \fIselect\fR\|(2) syscall with the bit masks specified, which
can be constructed using \f(CW\*(C`fileno\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vec\*(C'\fR, along these lines:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    $rin = $win = $ein = \*(Aq\*(Aq;
\&    vec($rin, fileno(STDIN),  1) = 1;
\&    vec($win, fileno(STDOUT), 1) = 1;
\&    $ein = $rin | $win;
.Ve
.Sp
If you want to select on many filehandles, you may wish to write a
subroutine like this:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    sub fhbits {
\&        my @fhlist = @_;
\&        my $bits = "";
\&        for my $fh (@fhlist) {
\&            vec($bits, fileno($fh), 1) = 1;
\&        }
\&        return $bits;
\&    }
\&    $rin = fhbits(*STDIN, *TTY, *MYSOCK);
.Ve
.Sp
The usual idiom is:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    ($nfound,$timeleft) =
\&      select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win, $eout=$ein, $timeout);
.Ve
.Sp
or to block until something becomes ready just do this
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $nfound = select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win, $eout=$ein, undef);
.Ve
.Sp
Most systems do not bother to return anything useful in \f(CW$timeleft\fR, so
calling \fIselect()\fR in scalar context just returns \f(CW$nfound\fR.
.Sp
Any of the bit masks can also be undef.  The timeout, if specified, is
in seconds, which may be fractional.  Note: not all implementations are
capable of returning the \f(CW$timeleft\fR.  If not, they always return
\&\f(CW$timeleft\fR equal to the supplied \f(CW$timeout\fR.
.Sp
You can effect a sleep of 250 milliseconds this way:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    select(undef, undef, undef, 0.25);
.Ve
.Sp
Note that whether \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR gets restarted after signals (say, \s-1SIGALRM\s0)
is implementation-dependent.  See also perlport for notes on the
portability of \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
On error, \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR behaves just like \fIselect\fR\|(2): it returns
\&\-1 and sets \f(CW$!\fR.
.Sp
On some Unixes, \fIselect\fR\|(2) may report a socket file descriptor as \*(L"ready for
reading\*(R" even when no data is available, and thus any subsequent \f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR
would block.  This can be avoided if you always use O_NONBLOCK on the
socket.  See \fIselect\fR\|(2) and \fIfcntl\fR\|(2) for further details.
.Sp
The standard \f(CW\*(C`IO::Select\*(C'\fR module provides a user-friendlier interface
to \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR, mostly because it does all the bit-mask work for you.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: One should not attempt to mix buffered I/O (like \f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR
or <\s-1FH\s0>) with \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR, except as permitted by \s-1POSIX,\s0 and even

You probably cannot mix \f(CW\*(C`alarm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`sleep\*(C'\fR calls, because \f(CW\*(C`sleep\*(C'\fR

On some older systems, it may sleep up to a full second less than what
you requested, depending on how it counts seconds.  Most modern systems
always sleep the full amount.  They may appear to sleep longer than that,
however, because your process might not be scheduled right away in a
busy multitasking system.

For delays of finer granularity than one second, the Time::HiRes module

In list context, this sorts the \s-1LIST\s0 and returns the sorted list value.
In scalar context, the behaviour of \f(CW\*(C`sort()\*(C'\fR is undefined.
.Sp
If \s-1SUBNAME\s0 or \s-1BLOCK\s0 is omitted, \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fRs in standard string comparison
order.  If \s-1SUBNAME\s0 is specified, it gives the name of a subroutine
that returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than \f(CW0\fR,
depending on how the elements of the list are to be ordered.  (The 
\&\f(CW\*(C`<=>\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`cmp\*(C'\fR operators are extremely useful in such routines.)
\&\s-1SUBNAME\s0 may be a scalar variable name (unsubscripted), in which case
the value provides the name of (or a reference to) the actual
subroutine to use.  In place of a \s-1SUBNAME,\s0 you can provide a \s-1BLOCK\s0 as
an anonymous, in-line sort subroutine.
.Sp
If the subroutine's prototype is \f(CW\*(C`($$)\*(C'\fR, the elements to be compared are
passed by reference in \f(CW@_\fR, as for a normal subroutine.  This is slower
than unprototyped subroutines, where the elements to be compared are passed
into the subroutine as the package global variables \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR (see example
below).  Note that in the latter case, it is usually highly counter-productive
to declare \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR as lexicals.
.Sp
If the subroutine is an \s-1XSUB,\s0 the elements to be compared are pushed on to
the stack, the way arguments are usually passed to XSUBs.  \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR are
not set.
.Sp
The values to be compared are always passed by reference and should not
be modified.
.Sp
You also cannot exit out of the sort block or subroutine using any of the
loop control operators described in perlsyn or with \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
When \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR (but not \f(CW\*(C`use locale \*(Aqnot_characters\*(Aq\*(C'\fR) is in
effect, \f(CW\*(C`sort LIST\*(C'\fR sorts \s-1LIST\s0 according to the
current collation locale.  See perllocale.
.Sp
\&\fIsort()\fR returns aliases into the original list, much as a for loop's index
variable aliases the list elements.  That is, modifying an element of a
list returned by \fIsort()\fR (for example, in a \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR)
actually modifies the element in the original list.  This is usually
something to be avoided when writing clear code.
.Sp
Perl 5.6 and earlier used a quicksort algorithm to implement sort.
That algorithm was not stable, so \fIcould\fR go quadratic.  (A \fIstable\fR sort
preserves the input order of elements that compare equal.  Although
quicksort's run time is O(NlogN) when averaged over all arrays of
length N, the time can be O(N**2), \fIquadratic\fR behavior, for some
inputs.)  In 5.7, the quicksort implementation was replaced with
a stable mergesort algorithm whose worst-case behavior is O(NlogN).
But benchmarks indicated that for some inputs, on some platforms,
the original quicksort was faster.  5.8 has a sort pragma for
limited control of the sort.  Its rather blunt control of the
underlying algorithm may not persist into future Perls, but the
ability to characterize the input or output in implementation
independent ways quite probably will.  See the sort pragma.

If you're using strict, you \fImust not\fR declare \f(CW$a\fR

.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @articles = sort {$b <=> $a} @files;

.Sp
then \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR are \f(CW$main::a\fR and \f(CW$main::b\fR (or \f(CW$::a\fR and \f(CW$::b\fR),
but if you're in the \f(CW\*(C`FooPack\*(C'\fR package, it's the same as typing

The comparison function is required to behave.  If it returns
inconsistent results (sometimes saying \f(CW$x[1]\fR is less than \f(CW$x[2]\fR and

comparison function like \f(CW\*(C`$a <=> $b\*(C'\fR any lists that might contain a
\&\f(CW\*(C`NaN\*(C'\fR.  The following example takes advantage that \f(CW\*(C`NaN != NaN\*(C'\fR to

Splits the string \s-1EXPR\s0 into a list of strings and returns the
list in list context, or the size of the list in scalar context.
.Sp
If only \s-1PATTERN\s0 is given, \s-1EXPR\s0 defaults to \f(CW$_\fR.
.Sp
Anything in \s-1EXPR\s0 that matches \s-1PATTERN\s0 is taken to be a separator
that separates the \s-1EXPR\s0 into substrings (called "\fIfields\fR") that
do \fBnot\fR include the separator.  Note that a separator may be
longer than one character or even have no characters at all (the
empty string, which is a zero-width match).
.Sp
The \s-1PATTERN\s0 need not be constant; an expression may be used
to specify a pattern that varies at runtime.
.Sp
If \s-1PATTERN\s0 matches the empty string, the \s-1EXPR\s0 is split at the match
position (between characters).  As an example, the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(\*(Aqb\*(Aq, \*(Aqabc\*(Aq)), "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
uses the 'b' in 'abc' as a separator to produce the output 'a:c'.
However, this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(\*(Aq\*(Aq, \*(Aqabc\*(Aq)), "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
uses empty string matches as separators to produce the output
\&'a:b:c'; thus, the empty string may be used to split \s-1EXPR\s0 into a
list of its component characters.
.Sp
As a special case for \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR, the empty pattern given in
match operator syntax (\f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR) specifically matches the empty string, which is contrary to its usual
interpretation as the last successful match.
.Sp
If \s-1PATTERN\s0 is \f(CW\*(C`/^/\*(C'\fR, then it is treated as if it used the
multiline modifier (\f(CW\*(C`/^/m\*(C'\fR), since it
isn't much use otherwise.
.Sp
As another special case, \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR emulates the default behavior of the
command line tool \fBawk\fR when the \s-1PATTERN\s0 is either omitted or a \fIliteral
string\fR composed of a single space character (such as \f(CW\*(Aq\ \*(Aq\fR or
\&\f(CW"\ex20"\fR, but not e.g. \f(CW\*(C`/\ /\*(C'\fR).  In this case, any leading
whitespace in \s-1EXPR\s0 is removed before splitting occurs, and the \s-1PATTERN\s0 is
instead treated as if it were \f(CW\*(C`/\es+/\*(C'\fR; in particular, this means that
\&\fIany\fR contiguous whitespace (not just a single space character) is used as
a separator.  However, this special treatment can be avoided by specifying
the pattern \f(CW\*(C`/\ /\*(C'\fR instead of the string \f(CW"\ "\fR, thereby allowing
only a single space character to be a separator. In earlier Perl's this
special case was restricted to the use of a plain \f(CW"\ "\fR as the
pattern argument to split, in Perl 5.18.0 and later this special case is
triggered by any expression which evaluates as the simple string \f(CW"\ "\fR.
.Sp
If omitted, \s-1PATTERN\s0 defaults to a single space, \f(CW"\ "\fR, triggering
the previously described \fIawk\fR emulation.
.Sp
If \s-1LIMIT\s0 is specified and positive, it represents the maximum number
of fields into which the \s-1EXPR\s0 may be split; in other words, \s-1LIMIT\s0 is
one greater than the maximum number of times \s-1EXPR\s0 may be split.  Thus,
the \s-1LIMIT\s0 value \f(CW1\fR means that \s-1EXPR\s0 may be split a maximum of zero
times, producing a maximum of one field (namely, the entire value of
\&\s-1EXPR\s0).  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(//, \*(Aqabc\*(Aq, 1)), "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
produces the output 'abc', and this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(//, \*(Aqabc\*(Aq, 2)), "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
produces the output 'a:bc', and each of these:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(//, \*(Aqabc\*(Aq, 3)), "\en";
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(//, \*(Aqabc\*(Aq, 4)), "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
produces the output 'a:b:c'.
.Sp
If \s-1LIMIT\s0 is negative, it is treated as if it were instead arbitrarily
large; as many fields as possible are produced.
.Sp
If \s-1LIMIT\s0 is omitted (or, equivalently, zero), then it is usually
treated as if it were instead negative but with the exception that
trailing empty fields are stripped (empty leading fields are always
preserved); if all fields are empty, then all fields are considered to
be trailing (and are thus stripped in this case).  Thus, the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(\*(Aq,\*(Aq, \*(Aqa,b,c,,,\*(Aq)), "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
produces the output 'a:b:c', but the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(\*(Aq,\*(Aq, \*(Aqa,b,c,,,\*(Aq, \-1)), "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
produces the output 'a:b:c:::'.
.Sp
In time-critical applications, it is worthwhile to avoid splitting
into more fields than necessary.  Thus, when assigning to a list,
if \s-1LIMIT\s0 is omitted (or zero), then \s-1LIMIT\s0 is treated as though it
were one larger than the number of variables in the list; for the
following, \s-1LIMIT\s0 is implicitly 3:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ($login, $passwd) = split(/:/);
.Ve
.Sp
Note that splitting an \s-1EXPR\s0 that evaluates to the empty string always
produces zero fields, regardless of the \s-1LIMIT\s0 specified.
.Sp
An empty leading field is produced when there is a positive-width
match at the beginning of \s-1EXPR. \s0 For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(/ /, \*(Aq abc\*(Aq)), "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
produces the output ':abc'.  However, a zero-width match at the
beginning of \s-1EXPR\s0 never produces an empty field, so that:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(//, \*(Aq abc\*(Aq));
.Ve
.Sp
produces the output '\ :a:b:c' (rather than ':\ :a:b:c').
.Sp
An empty trailing field, on the other hand, is produced when there is a
match at the end of \s-1EXPR,\s0 regardless of the length of the match
(of course, unless a non-zero \s-1LIMIT\s0 is given explicitly, such fields are
removed, as in the last example).  Thus:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print join(\*(Aq:\*(Aq, split(//, \*(Aq abc\*(Aq, \-1)), "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
produces the output '\ :a:b:c:'.
.Sp
If the \s-1PATTERN\s0 contains
capturing groups,
then for each separator, an additional field is produced for each substring
captured by a group (in the order in which the groups are specified,
as per backreferences); if any group does not
match, then it captures the \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR value instead of a substring.  Also,

.IP "sprintf \s-1FORMAT, LIST \s0" 4
.IX Xref "sprintf"
.IX Item "sprintf FORMAT, LIST "
Returns a string formatted by the usual \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR conventions of the C
library function \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR.  See below for more details
and see \fIsprintf\fR\|(3) or \fIprintf\fR\|(3) on your system for an explanation of
the general principles.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # Format number with up to 8 leading zeroes
\&        $result = sprintf("%08d", $number);
\&
\&        # Round number to 3 digits after decimal point
\&        $rounded = sprintf("%.3f", $number);
.Ve
.Sp
Perl does its own \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR formatting: it emulates the C
function \fIsprintf\fR\|(3), but doesn't use it except for floating-point
numbers, and even then only standard modifiers are allowed.  
Non-standard extensions in your local \fIsprintf\fR\|(3) are 
therefore unavailable from Perl.
.Sp
Unlike \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR does not do what you probably mean when you
pass it an array as your first argument. 
The array is given scalar context,
and instead of using the 0th element of the array as the format, Perl will
use the count of elements in the array as the format, which is almost never
useful.
.Sp
Perl's \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR permits the following universally-known conversions:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&   %%    a percent sign
\&   %c    a character with the given number
\&   %s    a string
\&   %d    a signed integer, in decimal
\&   %u    an unsigned integer, in decimal
\&   %o    an unsigned integer, in octal
\&   %x    an unsigned integer, in hexadecimal
\&   %e    a floating\-point number, in scientific notation
\&   %f    a floating\-point number, in fixed decimal notation
\&   %g    a floating\-point number, in %e or %f notation
.Ve
.Sp
In addition, Perl permits the following widely-supported conversions:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&   %X    like %x, but using upper\-case letters
\&   %E    like %e, but using an upper\-case "E"
\&   %G    like %g, but with an upper\-case "E" (if applicable)
\&   %b    an unsigned integer, in binary
\&   %B    like %b, but using an upper\-case "B" with the # flag
\&   %p    a pointer (outputs the Perl value\*(Aqs address in hexadecimal)
\&   %n    special: *stores* the number of characters output so far
\&         into the next argument in the parameter list
.Ve
.Sp
Finally, for backward (and we do mean \*(L"backward\*(R") compatibility, Perl
permits these unnecessary but widely-supported conversions:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&   %i    a synonym for %d
\&   %D    a synonym for %ld
\&   %U    a synonym for %lu
\&   %O    a synonym for %lo
\&   %F    a synonym for %f
.Ve
.Sp
Note that the number of exponent digits in the scientific notation produced
by \f(CW%e\fR, \f(CW%E\fR, \f(CW%g\fR and \f(CW%G\fR for numbers with the modulus of the
exponent less than 100 is system-dependent: it may be three or less
(zero-padded as necessary).  In other words, 1.23 times ten to the
99th may be either \*(L"1.23e99\*(R" or \*(L"1.23e099\*(R".
.Sp
Between the \f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR and the format letter, you may specify several
additional attributes controlling the interpretation of the format.
In order, these are:
.RS 4
.IP "format parameter index" 4
.IX Item "format parameter index"
An explicit format parameter index, such as \f(CW\*(C`2$\*(C'\fR.  By default sprintf
will format the next unused argument in the list, but this allows you
to take the arguments out of order:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf \*(Aq%2$d %1$d\*(Aq, 12, 34;      # prints "34 12"
\&  printf \*(Aq%3$d %d %1$d\*(Aq, 1, 2, 3;  # prints "3 1 1"
.Ve
.IP "flags" 4
.IX Item "flags"
one or more of:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&   space   prefix non\-negative number with a space
\&   +       prefix non\-negative number with a plus sign
\&   \-       left\-justify within the field
\&   0       use zeros, not spaces, to right\-justify
\&   #       ensure the leading "0" for any octal,
\&           prefix non\-zero hexadecimal with "0x" or "0X",
\&           prefix non\-zero binary with "0b" or "0B"
.Ve
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&  printf \*(Aq<% d>\*(Aq,  12;   # prints "< 12>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%+d>\*(Aq,  12;   # prints "<+12>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%6s>\*(Aq,  12;   # prints "<    12>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%\-6s>\*(Aq, 12;   # prints "<12    >"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%06s>\*(Aq, 12;   # prints "<000012>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%#o>\*(Aq,  12;   # prints "<014>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%#x>\*(Aq,  12;   # prints "<0xc>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%#X>\*(Aq,  12;   # prints "<0XC>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%#b>\*(Aq,  12;   # prints "<0b1100>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%#B>\*(Aq,  12;   # prints "<0B1100>"
.Ve
.Sp
When a space and a plus sign are given as the flags at once,
a plus sign is used to prefix a positive number.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf \*(Aq<%+ d>\*(Aq, 12;   # prints "<+12>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<% +d>\*(Aq, 12;   # prints "<+12>"
.Ve
.Sp
When the # flag and a precision are given in the \f(CW%o\fR conversion,
the precision is incremented if it's necessary for the leading \*(L"0\*(R".
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  printf \*(Aq<%#.5o>\*(Aq, 012;      # prints "<00012>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%#.5o>\*(Aq, 012345;   # prints "<012345>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%#.0o>\*(Aq, 0;        # prints "<0>"
.Ve
.IP "vector flag" 4
.IX Item "vector flag"
This flag tells Perl to interpret the supplied string as a vector of
integers, one for each character in the string.  Perl applies the format to
each integer in turn, then joins the resulting strings with a separator (a
dot \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR by default).  This can be useful for displaying ordinal values of
characters in arbitrary strings:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf "%vd", "AB\ex{100}";           # prints "65.66.256"
\&  printf "version is v%vd\en", $^V;     # Perl\*(Aqs version
.Ve
.Sp
Put an asterisk \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR before the \f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR to override the string to
use to separate the numbers:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf "address is %*vX\en", ":", $addr;   # IPv6 address
\&  printf "bits are %0*v8b\en", " ", $bits;   # random bitstring
.Ve
.Sp
You can also explicitly specify the argument number to use for
the join string using something like \f(CW\*(C`*2$v\*(C'\fR; for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf \*(Aq%*4$vX %*4$vX %*4$vX\*(Aq,       # 3 IPv6 addresses
\&          @addr[1..3], ":";
.Ve
.IP "(minimum) width" 4
.IX Item "(minimum) width"
Arguments are usually formatted to be only as wide as required to
display the given value.  You can override the width by putting
a number here, or get the width from the next argument (with \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR)
or from a specified argument (e.g., with \f(CW\*(C`*2$\*(C'\fR):
.Sp
.Vb 5
\& printf "<%s>", "a";       # prints "<a>"
\& printf "<%6s>", "a";      # prints "<     a>"
\& printf "<%*s>", 6, "a";   # prints "<     a>"
\& printf \*(Aq<%*2$s>\*(Aq, "a", 6; # prints "<     a>"
\& printf "<%2s>", "long";   # prints "<long>" (does not truncate)
.Ve
.Sp
If a field width obtained through \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR is negative, it has the same
effect as the \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR flag: left-justification.
.IP "precision, or maximum width" 4
.IX Xref "precision"
.IX Item "precision, or maximum width"
You can specify a precision (for numeric conversions) or a maximum
width (for string conversions) by specifying a \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR followed by a number.
For floating-point formats except \f(CW\*(C`g\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`G\*(C'\fR, this specifies
how many places right of the decimal point to show (the default being 6).
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  # these examples are subject to system\-specific variation
\&  printf \*(Aq<%f>\*(Aq, 1;    # prints "<1.000000>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.1f>\*(Aq, 1;  # prints "<1.0>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.0f>\*(Aq, 1;  # prints "<1>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%e>\*(Aq, 10;   # prints "<1.000000e+01>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.1e>\*(Aq, 10; # prints "<1.0e+01>"
.Ve
.Sp
For \*(L"g\*(R" and \*(L"G\*(R", this specifies the maximum number of digits to show,
including those prior to the decimal point and those after it; for 
example:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&  # These examples are subject to system\-specific variation.
\&  printf \*(Aq<%g>\*(Aq, 1;        # prints "<1>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.10g>\*(Aq, 1;     # prints "<1>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%g>\*(Aq, 100;      # prints "<100>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.1g>\*(Aq, 100;    # prints "<1e+02>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.2g>\*(Aq, 100.01; # prints "<1e+02>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.5g>\*(Aq, 100.01; # prints "<100.01>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.4g>\*(Aq, 100.01; # prints "<100>"
.Ve
.Sp
For integer conversions, specifying a precision implies that the
output of the number itself should be zero-padded to this width,
where the 0 flag is ignored:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.6d>\*(Aq, 1;      # prints "<000001>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%+.6d>\*(Aq, 1;     # prints "<+000001>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%\-10.6d>\*(Aq, 1;   # prints "<000001    >"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%10.6d>\*(Aq, 1;    # prints "<    000001>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%010.6d>\*(Aq, 1;   # prints "<    000001>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%+10.6d>\*(Aq, 1;   # prints "<   +000001>"
\&
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.6x>\*(Aq, 1;      # prints "<000001>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%#.6x>\*(Aq, 1;     # prints "<0x000001>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%\-10.6x>\*(Aq, 1;   # prints "<000001    >"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%10.6x>\*(Aq, 1;    # prints "<    000001>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%010.6x>\*(Aq, 1;   # prints "<    000001>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%#10.6x>\*(Aq, 1;   # prints "<  0x000001>"
.Ve
.Sp
For string conversions, specifying a precision truncates the string
to fit the specified width:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.5s>\*(Aq, "truncated";   # prints "<trunc>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%10.5s>\*(Aq, "truncated"; # prints "<     trunc>"
.Ve
.Sp
You can also get the precision from the next argument using \f(CW\*(C`.*\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.6x>\*(Aq, 1;       # prints "<000001>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.*x>\*(Aq, 6, 1;    # prints "<000001>"
.Ve
.Sp
If a precision obtained through \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR is negative, it counts
as having no precision at all.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.*s>\*(Aq,  7, "string";   # prints "<string>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.*s>\*(Aq,  3, "string";   # prints "<str>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.*s>\*(Aq,  0, "string";   # prints "<>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.*s>\*(Aq, \-1, "string";   # prints "<string>"
\&
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.*d>\*(Aq,  1, 0;   # prints "<0>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.*d>\*(Aq,  0, 0;   # prints "<>"
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.*d>\*(Aq, \-1, 0;   # prints "<0>"
.Ve
.Sp
You cannot currently get the precision from a specified number,
but it is intended that this will be possible in the future, for
example using \f(CW\*(C`.*2$\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf \*(Aq<%.*2$x>\*(Aq, 1, 6;   # INVALID, but in future will print
\&                             # "<000001>"
.Ve
.IP "size" 4
.IX Item "size"
For numeric conversions, you can specify the size to interpret the
number as using \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`V\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`q\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`L\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`ll\*(C'\fR.  For integer
conversions (\f(CW\*(C`d u o x X b i D U O\*(C'\fR), numbers are usually assumed to be
whatever the default integer size is on your platform (usually 32 or 64
bits), but you can override this to use instead one of the standard C types,
as supported by the compiler used to build Perl:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&   hh          interpret integer as C type "char" or "unsigned
\&               char" on Perl 5.14 or later
\&   h           interpret integer as C type "short" or
\&               "unsigned short"
\&   j           interpret integer as C type "intmax_t" on Perl
\&               5.14 or later, and only with a C99 compiler
\&               (unportable)
\&   l           interpret integer as C type "long" or
\&               "unsigned long"
\&   q, L, or ll interpret integer as C type "long long",
\&               "unsigned long long", or "quad" (typically
\&               64\-bit integers)
\&   t           interpret integer as C type "ptrdiff_t" on Perl
\&               5.14 or later
\&   z           interpret integer as C type "size_t" on Perl 5.14
\&               or later
.Ve
.Sp
As of 5.14, none of these raises an exception if they are not supported on
your platform.  However, if warnings are enabled, a warning of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR warning class is issued on an unsupported conversion flag.  
Should you instead prefer an exception, do this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use warnings FATAL => "printf";
.Ve
.Sp
If you would like to know about a version dependency before you
start running the program, put something like this at its top:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use 5.014;  # for hh/j/t/z/ printf modifiers
.Ve
.Sp
You can find out whether your Perl supports quads via Config:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    use Config;
\&    if ($Config{use64bitint} eq "define"
\&        || $Config{longsize} >= 8) {
\&        print "Nice quads!\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
For floating-point conversions (\f(CW\*(C`e f g E F G\*(C'\fR), numbers are usually assumed
to be the default floating-point size on your platform (double or long double),
but you can force \*(L"long double\*(R" with \f(CW\*(C`q\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`L\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`ll\*(C'\fR if your
platform supports them.  You can find out whether your Perl supports long
doubles via Config:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use Config;
\&    print "long doubles\en" if $Config{d_longdbl} eq "define";
.Ve
.Sp
You can find out whether Perl considers \*(L"long double\*(R" to be the default
floating-point size to use on your platform via Config:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    use Config;
\&    if ($Config{uselongdouble} eq "define") {
\&        print "long doubles by default\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
It can also be that long doubles and doubles are the same thing:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        use Config;
\&        ($Config{doublesize} == $Config{longdblsize}) &&
\&                print "doubles are long doubles\en";
.Ve
.Sp
The size specifier \f(CW\*(C`V\*(C'\fR has no effect for Perl code, but is supported for
compatibility with \s-1XS\s0 code.  It means \*(L"use the standard size for a Perl
integer or floating-point number\*(R", which is the default.
.IP "order of arguments" 4
.IX Item "order of arguments"
Normally, \fIsprintf()\fR takes the next unused argument as the value to
format for each format specification.  If the format specification
uses \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR to require additional arguments, these are consumed from
the argument list in the order they appear in the format
specification \fIbefore\fR the value to format.  Where an argument is
specified by an explicit index, this does not affect the normal
order for the arguments, even when the explicitly specified index
would have been the next argument.
.Sp
So:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    printf "<%*.*s>", $a, $b, $c;
.Ve
.Sp
uses \f(CW$a\fR for the width, \f(CW$b\fR for the precision, and \f(CW$c\fR
as the value to format; while:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  printf \*(Aq<%*1$.*s>\*(Aq, $a, $b;
.Ve
.Sp
would use \f(CW$a\fR for the width and precision, and \f(CW$b\fR as the
value to format.
.Sp
Here are some more examples; be aware that when using an explicit
index, the \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR may need escaping:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  printf "%2\e$d %d\en",    12, 34;      # will print "34 12\en"
\&  printf "%2\e$d %d %d\en", 12, 34;      # will print "34 12 34\en"
\&  printf "%3\e$d %d %d\en", 12, 34, 56;  # will print "56 12 34\en"

Sets and returns the random number seed for the \f(CW\*(C`rand\*(C'\fR operator.
.Sp
The point of the function is to \*(L"seed\*(R" the \f(CW\*(C`rand\*(C'\fR function so that \f(CW\*(C`rand\*(C'\fR
can produce a different sequence each time you run your program.  When
called with a parameter, \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR uses that for the seed; otherwise it
(semi\-)randomly chooses a seed.  In either case, starting with Perl 5.14,
it returns the seed.  To signal that your code will work \fIonly\fR on Perls
of a recent vintage:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use 5.014;  # so srand returns the seed
.Ve
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`srand()\*(C'\fR is not called explicitly, it is called implicitly without a
parameter at the first use of the \f(CW\*(C`rand\*(C'\fR operator.
However, there are a few situations where programs are likely to
want to call \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR.  One is for generating predictable results, generally for
testing or debugging.  There, you use \f(CW\*(C`srand($seed)\*(C'\fR, with the same \f(CW$seed\fR
each time.  Another case is that you may want to call \f(CW\*(C`srand()\*(C'\fR
after a \f(CW\*(C`fork()\*(C'\fR to avoid child processes sharing the same seed value as the
parent (and consequently each other).
.Sp
Do \fBnot\fR call \f(CW\*(C`srand()\*(C'\fR (i.e., without an argument) more than once per
process.  The internal state of the random number generator should
contain more entropy than can be provided by any seed, so calling
\&\f(CW\*(C`srand()\*(C'\fR again actually \fIloses\fR randomness.
.Sp
Most implementations of \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR take an integer and will silently
truncate decimal numbers.  This means \f(CW\*(C`srand(42)\*(C'\fR will usually
produce the same results as \f(CW\*(C`srand(42.1)\*(C'\fR.  To be safe, always pass
\&\f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR an integer.
.Sp
A typical use of the returned seed is for a test program which has too many
combinations to test comprehensively in the time available to it each run.  It
can test a random subset each time, and should there be a failure, log the seed
used for that run so that it can later be used to reproduce the same results.
.Sp

If \f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fR is passed the special filehandle consisting of an underline, no
stat is done, but the current contents of the stat structure from the
last \f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`lstat\*(C'\fR, or filetest are returned.  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    if (\-x $file && (($d) = stat(_)) && $d < 0) {
\&        print "$file is executable NFS file\en";
\&    }

(This works on machines only for which the device number is negative

Because the mode contains both the file type and its permissions, you
should mask off the file type portion and (s)printf using a \f(CW"%o"\fR
if you want to see the real permissions.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $mode = (stat($filename))[2];
\&    printf "Permissions are %04o\en", $mode & 07777;
.Ve
.Sp
In scalar context, \f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fR returns a boolean value indicating success
or failure, and, if successful, sets the information associated with
the special filehandle \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The File::stat module provides a convenient, by-name access mechanism:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    use File::stat;
\&    $sb = stat($filename);
\&    printf "File is %s, size is %s, perm %04o, mtime %s\en",
\&           $filename, $sb\->size, $sb\->mode & 07777,
\&           scalar localtime $sb\->mtime;
.Ve
.Sp
You can import symbolic mode constants (\f(CW\*(C`S_IF*\*(C'\fR) and functions
(\f(CW\*(C`S_IS*\*(C'\fR) from the Fcntl module:
.Sp

Takes extra time to study \s-1SCALAR \s0(\f(CW$_\fR if unspecified) in anticipation of
doing many pattern matches on the string before it is next modified.
This may or may not save time, depending on the nature and number of
patterns you are searching and the distribution of character
frequencies in the string to be searched; you probably want to compare
run times with and without it to see which is faster.  Those loops
that scan for many short constant strings (including the constant
parts of more complex patterns) will benefit most.
(The way \f(CW\*(C`study\*(C'\fR works is this: a linked list of every
character in the string to be searched is made, so we know, for
example, where all the \f(CW\*(Aqk\*(Aq\fR characters are.  From each search string,
the rarest character is selected, based on some static frequency tables
constructed from some C programs and English text.  Only those places
that contain this \*(L"rarest\*(R" character are examined.)
.Sp
For example, here is a loop that inserts index producing entries
before any line containing a certain pattern:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    while (<>) {
\&        study;
\&        print ".IX foo\en"    if /\ebfoo\eb/;
\&        print ".IX bar\en"    if /\ebbar\eb/;
\&        print ".IX blurfl\en" if /\ebblurfl\eb/;
\&        # ...
\&        print;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
In searching for \f(CW\*(C`/\ebfoo\eb/\*(C'\fR, only locations in \f(CW$_\fR that contain \f(CW\*(C`f\*(C'\fR
will be looked at, because \f(CW\*(C`f\*(C'\fR is rarer than \f(CW\*(C`o\*(C'\fR.  In general, this is
a big win except in pathological cases.  The only question is whether
it saves you more time than it took to build the linked list in the
first place.
.Sp
Note that if you have to look for strings that you don't know till
runtime, you can build an entire loop as a string and \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR that to
avoid recompiling all your patterns all the time.  Together with
undefining \f(CW$/\fR to input entire files as one record, this can be quite
fast, often faster than specialized programs like \fIfgrep\fR\|(1).  The following
scans a list of files (\f(CW@files\fR) for a list of words (\f(CW@words\fR), and prints
out the names of those files that contain a match:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&    $search = \*(Aqwhile (<>) { study;\*(Aq;

You can use the \fIsubstr()\fR function as an lvalue, in which case \s-1EXPR\s0
must itself be an lvalue.  If you assign something shorter than \s-1LENGTH,\s0
the string will shrink, and if you assign something longer than \s-1LENGTH,\s0
the string will grow to accommodate it.  To keep the string the same
length, you may need to pad or chop your value using \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \s-1OFFSET\s0 and \s-1LENGTH\s0 specify a substring that is partly outside the
string, only the part within the string is returned.  If the substring
is beyond either end of the string, \fIsubstr()\fR returns the undefined
value and produces a warning.  When used as an lvalue, specifying a
substring that is entirely outside the string raises an exception.
Here's an example showing the behavior for boundary cases:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    my $name = \*(Aqfred\*(Aq;
\&    substr($name, 4) = \*(Aqdy\*(Aq;         # $name is now \*(Aqfreddy\*(Aq
\&    my $null = substr $name, 6, 2;   # returns "" (no warning)
\&    my $oops = substr $name, 7;      # returns undef, with warning
\&    substr($name, 7) = \*(Aqgap\*(Aq;        # raises an exception
.Ve
.Sp
An alternative to using \fIsubstr()\fR as an lvalue is to specify the
replacement string as the 4th argument.  This allows you to replace
parts of the \s-1EXPR\s0 and return what was there before in one operation,
just as you can with \fIsplice()\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    my $s = "The black cat climbed the green tree";
\&    my $z = substr $s, 14, 7, "jumped from";    # climbed
\&    # $s is now "The black cat jumped from the green tree"
.Ve
.Sp
Note that the lvalue returned by the three-argument version of \fIsubstr()\fR acts as
a 'magic bullet'; each time it is assigned to, it remembers which part
of the original string is being modified; for example:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    $x = \*(Aq1234\*(Aq;
\&    for (substr($x,1,2)) {
\&        $_ = \*(Aqa\*(Aq;   print $x,"\en";    # prints 1a4
\&        $_ = \*(Aqxyz\*(Aq; print $x,"\en";    # prints 1xyz4
\&        $x = \*(Aq56789\*(Aq;
\&        $_ = \*(Aqpq\*(Aq;  print $x,"\en";    # prints 5pq9
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
With negative offsets, it remembers its position from the end of the string
when the target string is modified:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    $x = \*(Aq1234\*(Aq;
\&    for (substr($x, \-3, 2)) {
\&        $_ = \*(Aqa\*(Aq;   print $x,"\en";    # prints 1a4, as above
\&        $x = \*(Aqabcdefg\*(Aq;
\&        print $_,"\en";                # prints f
\&    }

Prior to Perl version 5.10, the result of using an lvalue multiple times was
unspecified.  Prior to 5.16, the result with negative offsets was
unspecified.

Calls the system call specified as the first element of the list,
passing the remaining elements as arguments to the system call.  If
unimplemented, raises an exception.  The arguments are interpreted
as follows: if a given argument is numeric, the argument is passed as
an int.  If not, the pointer to the string value is passed.  You are
responsible to make sure a string is pre-extended long enough to
receive any result that might be written into a string.  You can't use a
string literal (or other read-only string) as an argument to \f(CW\*(C`syscall\*(C'\fR
because Perl has to assume that any string pointer might be written
through.  If your
integer arguments are not literals and have never been interpreted in a
numeric context, you may need to add \f(CW0\fR to them to force them to look
like numbers.  This emulates the \f(CW\*(C`syswrite\*(C'\fR function (or vice versa):
.Sp

Note that Perl supports passing of up to only 14 arguments to your syscall,

Syscall returns whatever value returned by the system call it calls.
If the system call fails, \f(CW\*(C`syscall\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR and sets \f(CW$!\fR (errno).
Note that some system calls \fIcan\fR legitimately return \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR.  The proper
way to handle such calls is to assign \f(CW\*(C`$!=0\*(C'\fR before the call, then
check the value of \f(CW$!\fR if \f(CW\*(C`syscall\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR.

There's a problem with \f(CW\*(C`syscall(&SYS_pipe)\*(C'\fR: it returns the file

If the file named by \s-1FILENAME\s0 does not exist and the \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR call creates
it (typically because \s-1MODE\s0 includes the \f(CW\*(C`O_CREAT\*(C'\fR flag), then the value of
\&\s-1PERMS\s0 specifies the permissions of the newly created file.  If you omit
the \s-1PERMS\s0 argument to \f(CW\*(C`sysopen\*(C'\fR, Perl uses the octal value \f(CW0666\fR.
These permission values need to be in octal, and are modified by your

In many systems the \f(CW\*(C`O_EXCL\*(C'\fR flag is available for opening files in

on network filesystems, and has no effect unless the \f(CW\*(C`O_CREAT\*(C'\fR flag
is set as well.  Setting \f(CW\*(C`O_CREAT|O_EXCL\*(C'\fR prevents the file from
being opened if it is a symbolic link.  It does not protect against

You should seldom if ever use \f(CW0644\fR as argument to \f(CW\*(C`sysopen\*(C'\fR, because

buffered \s-1IO,\s0 so mixing this with other kinds of reads, \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`eof\*(C'\fR can cause confusion because the
perlio or stdio layers usually buffers data.  Returns the number of
bytes actually read, \f(CW0\fR at end of file, or undef if there was an
error (in the latter case \f(CW$!\fR is also set).  \s-1SCALAR\s0 will be grown or
shrunk so that the last byte actually read is the last byte of the
scalar after the read.
.Sp
An \s-1OFFSET\s0 may be specified to place the read data at some place in the
string other than the beginning.  A negative \s-1OFFSET\s0 specifies
placement at that many characters counting backwards from the end of
the string.  A positive \s-1OFFSET\s0 greater than the length of \s-1SCALAR\s0
results in the string being padded to the required size with \f(CW"\e0"\fR
bytes before the result of the read is appended.
.Sp
There is no \fIsyseof()\fR function, which is ok, since \fIeof()\fR doesn't work
well on device files (like ttys) anyway.  Use \fIsysread()\fR and check
for a return value for 0 to decide whether you're done.
.Sp
Note that if the filehandle has been marked as \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR Unicode
characters are read instead of bytes (the \s-1LENGTH, OFFSET,\s0 and the
return value of \fIsysread()\fR are in Unicode characters).
The \f(CW\*(C`:encoding(...)\*(C'\fR layer implicitly introduces the \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR layer.

.IX Item "sysseek FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE "
Sets \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0's system position in bytes using \fIlseek\fR\|(2).  \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 may
be an expression whose value gives the name of the filehandle.  The values
for \s-1WHENCE\s0 are \f(CW0\fR to set the new position to \s-1POSITION\s0; \f(CW1\fR to set the it
to the current position plus \s-1POSITION\s0; and \f(CW2\fR to set it to \s-1EOF\s0 plus
\&\s-1POSITION,\s0 typically negative.
.Sp
Note the \fIin bytes\fR: even if the filehandle has been set to operate
on characters (for example by using the \f(CW\*(C`:encoding(utf8)\*(C'\fR I/O layer),
\&\fItell()\fR will return byte offsets, not character offsets (because
implementing that would render \fIsysseek()\fR unacceptably slow).
.Sp
\&\fIsysseek()\fR bypasses normal buffered \s-1IO,\s0 so mixing it with reads other
than \f(CW\*(C`sysread\*(C'\fR (for example \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR or \fIread()\fR) \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`eof\*(C'\fR may cause confusion.
.Sp
For \s-1WHENCE,\s0 you may also use the constants \f(CW\*(C`SEEK_SET\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`SEEK_CUR\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`SEEK_END\*(C'\fR (start of the file, current position, end of the file)
from the Fcntl module.  Use of the constants is also more portable
than relying on 0, 1, and 2.  For example to define a \*(L"systell\*(R" function:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use Fcntl \*(AqSEEK_CUR\*(Aq;
\&    sub systell { sysseek($_[0], 0, SEEK_CUR) }
.Ve
.Sp
Returns the new position, or the undefined value on failure.  A position
of zero is returned as the string \f(CW"0 but true"\fR; thus \f(CW\*(C`sysseek\*(C'\fR returns
true on success and false on failure, yet you can still easily determine
the new position.

Does exactly the same thing as \f(CW\*(C`exec LIST\*(C'\fR, except that a fork is
done first and the parent process waits for the child process to
exit.  Note that argument processing varies depending on the
number of arguments.  If there is more than one argument in \s-1LIST,\s0
or if \s-1LIST\s0 is an array with more than one value, starts the program
given by the first element of the list with arguments given by the
rest of the list.  If there is only one scalar argument, the argument
is checked for shell metacharacters, and if there are any, the
entire argument is passed to the system's command shell for parsing
(this is \f(CW\*(C`/bin/sh \-c\*(C'\fR on Unix platforms, but varies on other
platforms).  If there are no shell metacharacters in the argument,
it is split into words and passed directly to \f(CW\*(C`execvp\*(C'\fR, which is
more efficient.
.Sp
Perl will attempt to flush all files opened for
output before any operation that may do a fork, but this may not be
supported on some platforms (see perlport).  To be safe, you may need
to set \f(CW$|\fR ($AUTOFLUSH in English) or call the \f(CW\*(C`autoflush()\*(C'\fR method
of \f(CW\*(C`IO::Handle\*(C'\fR on any open handles.
.Sp
The return value is the exit status of the program as returned by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`wait\*(C'\fR call.  To get the actual exit value, shift right by eight (see
below).  See also \*(L"exec\*(R".  This is \fInot\fR what you want to use to capture
the output from a command; for that you should use merely backticks or
\&\f(CW\*(C`qx//\*(C'\fR, as described in \*(L"`STRING`\*(R" in perlop.  Return value of \-1
indicates a failure to start the program or an error of the \fIwait\fR\|(2) system
call (inspect $! for the reason).
.Sp
If you'd like to make \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR (and many other bits of Perl) die on error,
have a look at the autodie pragma.
.Sp
Like \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR allows you to lie to a program about its name if
you use the \f(CW\*(C`system PROGRAM LIST\*(C'\fR syntax.  Again, see \*(L"exec\*(R".
.Sp
Since \f(CW\*(C`SIGINT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SIGQUIT\*(C'\fR are ignored during the execution of
\&\f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR, if you expect your program to terminate on receipt of these
signals you will need to arrange to do so yourself based on the return
value.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    @args = ("command", "arg1", "arg2");
\&    system(@args) == 0
\&        or die "system @args failed: $?"
.Ve
.Sp
If you'd like to manually inspect \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR's failure, you can check all
possible failure modes by inspecting \f(CW$?\fR like this:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    if ($? == \-1) {
\&        print "failed to execute: $!\en";
\&    }
\&    elsif ($? & 127) {
\&        printf "child died with signal %d, %s coredump\en",
\&            ($? & 127),  ($? & 128) ? \*(Aqwith\*(Aq : \*(Aqwithout\*(Aq;
\&    }
\&    else {
\&        printf "child exited with value %d\en", $? >> 8;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Alternatively, you may inspect the value of \f(CW\*(C`${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}\*(C'\fR
with the \f(CW\*(C`W*()\*(C'\fR calls from the \s-1POSIX\s0 module.
.Sp
When \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR's arguments are executed indirectly by the shell, 
results and return codes are subject to its quirks.
See \*(L"`STRING`\*(R" in perlop and \*(L"exec\*(R" for details.
.Sp
Since \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR does a \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`wait\*(C'\fR it may affect a \f(CW\*(C`SIGCHLD\*(C'\fR

An \s-1OFFSET\s0 may be specified to write the data from some part of the

Note the \fIin bytes\fR: even if the filehandle has been set to

The return value of \fItell()\fR for the standard streams like the \s-1STDIN\s0

\&\f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR does the reverse of \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR: it takes a string
and expands it out into a list of values.
(In scalar context, it returns merely the first value produced.)
.Sp
If \s-1EXPR\s0 is omitted, unpacks the \f(CW$_\fR string.
See perlpacktut for an introduction to this function.
.Sp
The string is broken into chunks described by the \s-1TEMPLATE. \s0 Each chunk
is converted separately to a value.  Typically, either the string is a result
of \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR, or the characters of the string represent a C structure of some
kind.
.Sp
The \s-1TEMPLATE\s0 has the same format as in the \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR function.
Here's a subroutine that does substring:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    sub substr {
\&        my($what,$where,$howmuch) = @_;
\&        unpack("x$where a$howmuch", $what);
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
and then there's
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub ordinal { unpack("W",$_[0]); } # same as ord()
.Ve
.Sp
In addition to fields allowed in \fIpack()\fR, you may prefix a field with
a %<number> to indicate that
you want a <number>\-bit checksum of the items instead of the items
themselves.  Default is a 16\-bit checksum.  Checksum is calculated by
summing numeric values of expanded values (for string fields the sum of
\&\f(CW\*(C`ord($char)\*(C'\fR is taken; for bit fields the sum of zeroes and ones).
.Sp
For example, the following
computes the same number as the System V sum program:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    $checksum = do {
\&        local $/;  # slurp!
\&        unpack("%32W*",<>) % 65535;
\&    };
.Ve
.Sp
The following efficiently counts the number of set bits in a bit vector:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $setbits = unpack("%32b*", $selectmask);
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`P\*(C'\fR formats should be used with care.  Since Perl
has no way of checking whether the value passed to \f(CW\*(C`unpack()\*(C'\fR
corresponds to a valid memory location, passing a pointer value that's
not known to be valid is likely to have disastrous consequences.
.Sp
If there are more pack codes or if the repeat count of a field or a group
is larger than what the remainder of the input string allows, the result
is not well defined: the repeat count may be decreased, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`unpack()\*(C'\fR may produce empty strings or zeros, or it may raise an exception.
If the input string is longer than one described by the \s-1TEMPLATE,\s0
the remainder of that input string is ignored.
.Sp

Imports some semantics into the current package from the named module,
generally by aliasing certain subroutine or variable names into your
package.  It is exactly equivalent to
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Sp
except that Module \fImust\fR be a bareword.
The importation can be made conditional by using the if module.
.Sp
In the peculiar \f(CW\*(C`use VERSION\*(C'\fR form, \s-1VERSION\s0 may be either a positive
decimal fraction such as 5.006, which will be compared to \f(CW$]\fR, or a v\-string
of the form v5.6.1, which will be compared to \f(CW$^V\fR (aka \f(CW$PERL_VERSION\fR).  An
exception is raised if \s-1VERSION\s0 is greater than the version of the
current Perl interpreter; Perl will not attempt to parse the rest of the
file.  Compare with \*(L"require\*(R", which can do a similar check at run time.
Symmetrically, \f(CW\*(C`no VERSION\*(C'\fR allows you to specify that you want a version
of Perl older than the specified one.
.Sp
Specifying \s-1VERSION\s0 as a literal of the form v5.6.1 should generally be
avoided, because it leads to misleading error messages under earlier
versions of Perl (that is, prior to 5.6.0) that do not support this
syntax.  The equivalent numeric version should be used instead.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    use v5.6.1;     # compile time version check
\&    use 5.6.1;      # ditto
\&    use 5.006_001;  # ditto; preferred for backwards compatibility
.Ve
.Sp
This is often useful if you need to check the current Perl version before
\&\f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fRing library modules that won't work with older versions of Perl.
(We try not to do this more than we have to.)
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`use VERSION\*(C'\fR also enables all features available in the requested
version as defined by the \f(CW\*(C`feature\*(C'\fR pragma, disabling any features
not in the requested version's feature bundle.  See feature.
Similarly, if the specified Perl version is greater than or equal to
5.12.0, strictures are enabled lexically as
with \f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR.  Any explicit use of
\&\f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`no strict\*(C'\fR overrides \f(CW\*(C`use VERSION\*(C'\fR, even if it comes
before it.  In both cases, the \fIfeature.pm\fR and \fIstrict.pm\fR files are
not actually loaded.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR forces the \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR to happen at compile time.  The
\&\f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR makes sure the module is loaded into memory if it hasn't been
yet.  The \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR is not a builtin; it's just an ordinary static method
call into the \f(CW\*(C`Module\*(C'\fR package to tell the module to import the list of
features back into the current package.  The module can implement its
\&\f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR method any way it likes, though most modules just choose to
derive their \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR method via inheritance from the \f(CW\*(C`Exporter\*(C'\fR class that
is defined in the \f(CW\*(C`Exporter\*(C'\fR module.  See Exporter.  If no \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR
method can be found then the call is skipped, even if there is an \s-1AUTOLOAD\s0
method.
.Sp
If you do not want to call the package's \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR method (for instance,
to stop your namespace from being altered), explicitly supply the empty list:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use Module ();
.Ve
.Sp
That is exactly equivalent to
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    BEGIN { require Module }
.Ve
.Sp
If the \s-1VERSION\s0 argument is present between Module and \s-1LIST,\s0 then the
\&\f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR will call the \s-1VERSION\s0 method in class Module with the given
version as an argument.  The default \s-1VERSION\s0 method, inherited from
the \s-1UNIVERSAL\s0 class, croaks if the given version is larger than the
value of the variable \f(CW$Module::VERSION\fR.
.Sp
Again, there is a distinction between omitting \s-1LIST \s0(\f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR called
with no arguments) and an explicit empty \s-1LIST \s0\f(CW\*(C`()\*(C'\fR (\f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR not
called).  Note that there is no comma after \s-1VERSION\s0!
.Sp
Because this is a wide-open interface, pragmas (compiler directives)
are also implemented this way.  Currently implemented pragmas are:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    use constant;
\&    use diagnostics;
\&    use integer;
\&    use sigtrap  qw(SEGV BUS);
\&    use strict   qw(subs vars refs);
\&    use subs     qw(afunc blurfl);
\&    use warnings qw(all);
\&    use sort     qw(stable _quicksort _mergesort);
.Ve
.Sp
Some of these pseudo-modules import semantics into the current
block scope (like \f(CW\*(C`strict\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`integer\*(C'\fR, unlike ordinary modules,
which import symbols into the current package (which are effective
through the end of the file).
.Sp
Because \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR takes effect at compile time, it doesn't respect the
ordinary flow control of the code being compiled.  In particular, putting
a \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR inside the false branch of a conditional doesn't prevent it
from being processed.  If a module or pragma only needs to be loaded 
conditionally, this can be done using the if pragma:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use if $] < 5.008, "utf8";
\&    use if WANT_WARNINGS, warnings => qw(all);
.Ve
.Sp
There's a corresponding \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR declaration that unimports meanings imported
by \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR, i.e., it calls \f(CW\*(C`unimport Module LIST\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR.
It behaves just as \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR does with \s-1VERSION,\s0 an omitted or empty \s-1LIST, \s0
or no unimport method being found.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    no integer;
\&    no strict \*(Aqrefs\*(Aq;
\&    no warnings;
.Ve
.Sp
Care should be taken when using the \f(CW\*(C`no VERSION\*(C'\fR form of \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR.  It is
\&\fIonly\fR meant to be used to assert that the running Perl is of a earlier
version than its argument and \fInot\fR to undo the feature-enabling side effects
of \f(CW\*(C`use VERSION\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
See perlmodlib for a list of standard modules and pragmas.  See perlrun
for the \f(CW\*(C`\-M\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-m\*(C'\fR command-line options to Perl that give \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR
functionality from the command-line.
.IP "utime \s-1LIST \s0" 4
.IX Xref "utime"
.IX Item "utime LIST "
Changes the access and modification times on each file of a list of
files.  The first two elements of the list must be the \s-1NUMERIC\s0 access
and modification times, in that order.  Returns the number of files
successfully changed.  The inode change time of each file is set
to the current time.  For example, this code has the same effect as the
Unix \fItouch\fR\|(1) command when the files \fIalready exist\fR and belong to
the user running the program:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
\&    $atime = $mtime = time;
\&    utime $atime, $mtime, @ARGV;
.Ve
.Sp
Since Perl 5.8.0, if the first two elements of the list are \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, 
the \fIutime\fR\|(2) syscall from your C library is called with a null second
argument.  On most systems, this will set the file's access and
modification times to the current time (i.e., equivalent to the example
above) and will work even on files you don't own provided you have write
permission:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    for $file (@ARGV) {
\&        utime(undef, undef, $file) 
\&            || warn "couldn\*(Aqt touch $file: $!";
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Under \s-1NFS\s0 this will use the time of the \s-1NFS\s0 server, not the time of
the local machine.  If there is a time synchronization problem, the
\&\s-1NFS\s0 server and local machine will have different times.  The Unix
\&\fItouch\fR\|(1) command will in fact normally use this form instead of the
one shown in the first example.
.Sp
Passing only one of the first two elements as \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is
equivalent to passing a 0 and will not have the effect 
described when both are \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.  This also triggers an
uninitialized warning.
.Sp
On systems that support \fIfutimes\fR\|(2), you may pass filehandles among the
files.  On systems that don't support \fIfutimes\fR\|(2), passing filehandles raises
an exception.  Filehandles must be passed as globs or glob references to be
recognized; barewords are considered filenames.

In list context, returns a list consisting of all the values of the named
hash.  In Perl 5.12 or later only, will also return a list of the values of
an array; prior to that release, attempting to use an array argument will
produce a syntax error.  In scalar context, returns the number of values.
.Sp
Hash entries are returned in an apparently random order.  The actual random
order is specific to a given hash; the exact same series of operations
on two hashes may result in a different order for each hash. Any insertion
into the hash may change the order, as will any deletion, with the exception
that the most recent key returned by \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR may be deleted
without changing the order. So long as a given hash is unmodified you may
rely on \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR to repeatedly return the same order
as each other. See \*(L"Algorithmic Complexity Attacks\*(R" in perlsec for
details on why hash order is randomized. Aside from the guarantees
provided here the exact details of Perl's hash algorithm and the hash
traversal order are subject to change in any release of Perl.
.Sp
As a side effect, calling \fIvalues()\fR resets the \s-1HASH\s0 or \s-1ARRAY\s0's internal
iterator, see \*(L"each\*(R".  (In particular, calling \fIvalues()\fR in void context
resets the iterator with no other overhead.  Apart from resetting the
iterator, \f(CW\*(C`values @array\*(C'\fR in list context is the same as plain \f(CW@array\fR.
(We recommend that you use void context \f(CW\*(C`keys @array\*(C'\fR for this, but
reasoned that taking \f(CW\*(C`values @array\*(C'\fR out would require more

.IP "vec \s-1EXPR,OFFSET,BITS \s0" 4
.IX Xref "vec bit bit vector"
.IX Item "vec EXPR,OFFSET,BITS "
Treats the string in \s-1EXPR\s0 as a bit vector made up of elements of
width \s-1BITS\s0 and returns the value of the element specified by \s-1OFFSET\s0
as an unsigned integer.  \s-1BITS\s0 therefore specifies the number of bits
that are reserved for each element in the bit vector.  This must
be a power of two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports
that).
.Sp
If \s-1BITS\s0 is 8, \*(L"elements\*(R" coincide with bytes of the input string.
.Sp
If \s-1BITS\s0 is 16 or more, bytes of the input string are grouped into chunks
of size \s-1BITS/8,\s0 and each group is converted to a number as with
\&\fIpack()\fR/\fIunpack()\fR with big-endian formats \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR (and analogously
for BITS==64).  See \*(L"pack\*(R" for details.
.Sp
If bits is 4 or less, the string is broken into bytes, then the bits
of each byte are broken into 8/BITS groups.  Bits of a byte are
numbered in a little-endian-ish way, as in \f(CW0x01\fR, \f(CW0x02\fR,
\&\f(CW0x04\fR, \f(CW0x08\fR, \f(CW0x10\fR, \f(CW0x20\fR, \f(CW0x40\fR, \f(CW0x80\fR.  For example,
breaking the single input byte \f(CW\*(C`chr(0x36)\*(C'\fR into two groups gives a list
\&\f(CW\*(C`(0x6, 0x3)\*(C'\fR; breaking it into 4 groups gives \f(CW\*(C`(0x2, 0x1, 0x3, 0x0)\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`vec\*(C'\fR may also be assigned to, in which case parentheses are needed
to give the expression the correct precedence as in
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    vec($image, $max_x * $x + $y, 8) = 3;
.Ve
.Sp
If the selected element is outside the string, the value 0 is returned.
If an element off the end of the string is written to, Perl will first
extend the string with sufficiently many zero bytes.   It is an error
to try to write off the beginning of the string (i.e., negative \s-1OFFSET\s0).
.Sp
If the string happens to be encoded as \s-1UTF\-8\s0 internally (and thus has
the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag set), this is ignored by \f(CW\*(C`vec\*(C'\fR, and it operates on the
internal byte string, not the conceptual character string, even if you
only have characters with values less than 256.
.Sp
Strings created with \f(CW\*(C`vec\*(C'\fR can also be manipulated with the logical
operators \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`~\*(C'\fR.  These operators will assume a bit
vector operation is desired when both operands are strings.

.IP "wait" 4
.IX Xref "wait"
.IX Item "wait"
Behaves like \fIwait\fR\|(2) on your system: it waits for a child
process to terminate and returns the pid of the deceased process, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR if there are no child processes.  The status is returned in \f(CW$?\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}\*(C'\fR.
Note that a return value of \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR could mean that child processes are
being automatically reaped, as described in perlipc.
.Sp
If you use wait in your handler for \f(CW$SIG\fR{\s-1CHLD\s0} it may accidentally for the
child created by \fIqx()\fR or \fIsystem()\fR.  See perlipc for details.

.IP "waitpid \s-1PID,FLAGS \s0" 4
.IX Xref "waitpid"
.IX Item "waitpid PID,FLAGS "
Waits for a particular child process to terminate and returns the pid of
the deceased process, or \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR if there is no such child process.  On some
systems, a value of 0 indicates that there are processes still running.
The status is returned in \f(CW$?\fR and \f(CW\*(C`${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}\*(C'\fR.  If you say
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    use POSIX ":sys_wait_h";
\&    #...
\&    do {
\&        $kid = waitpid(\-1, WNOHANG);
\&    } while $kid > 0;
.Ve
.Sp
then you can do a non-blocking wait for all pending zombie processes.
Non-blocking wait is available on machines supporting either the
\&\fIwaitpid\fR\|(2) or \fIwait4\fR\|(2) syscalls.  However, waiting for a particular
pid with \s-1FLAGS\s0 of \f(CW0\fR is implemented everywhere.  (Perl emulates the
system call by remembering the status values of processes that have
exited but have not been harvested by the Perl script yet.)
.Sp
Note that on some systems, a return value of \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR could mean that child
processes are being automatically reaped.  See perlipc for details,
and for other examples.

.IP "wantarray" 4
.IX Xref "wantarray context"
.IX Item "wantarray"
Returns true if the context of the currently executing subroutine or
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR is looking for a list value.  Returns false if the context is
looking for a scalar.  Returns the undefined value if the context is
looking for no value (void context).
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    return unless defined wantarray; # don\*(Aqt bother doing more
\&    my @a = complex_calculation();
\&    return wantarray ? @a : "@a";
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`wantarray()\*(C'\fR's result is unspecified in the top level of a file,
in a \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`UNITCHECK\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`CHECK\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`INIT\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR block, or
in a \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR method.
.Sp
This function should have been named \fIwantlist()\fR instead.
.IP "warn \s-1LIST \s0" 4
.IX Xref "warn warning STDERR"
.IX Item "warn LIST "
Prints the value of \s-1LIST\s0 to \s-1STDERR. \s0 If the last element of \s-1LIST\s0 does
not end in a newline, it appends the same file/line number text as \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR
does.
.Sp
If the output is empty and \f(CW$@\fR already contains a value (typically from a
previous eval) that value is used after appending \f(CW"\et...caught"\fR
to \f(CW$@\fR.  This is useful for staying almost, but not entirely similar to
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \f(CW$@\fR is empty then the string \f(CW"Warning: Something\*(Aqs wrong"\fR is used.
.Sp
No message is printed if there is a \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR handler
installed.  It is the handler's responsibility to deal with the message
as it sees fit (like, for instance, converting it into a \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR).  Most
handlers must therefore arrange to actually display the
warnings that they are not prepared to deal with, by calling \f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR
again in the handler.  Note that this is quite safe and will not
produce an endless loop, since \f(CW\*(C`_\|_WARN_\|_\*(C'\fR hooks are not called from
inside one.
.Sp
You will find this behavior is slightly different from that of
\&\f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR handlers (which don't suppress the error text, but can
instead call \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR again to change it).
.Sp
Using a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_WARN_\|_\*(C'\fR handler provides a powerful way to silence all
warnings (even the so-called mandatory ones).  An example:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    # wipe out *all* compile\-time warnings
\&    BEGIN { $SIG{\*(Aq_\|_WARN_\|_\*(Aq} = sub { warn $_[0] if $DOWARN } }
\&    my $foo = 10;
\&    my $foo = 20;          # no warning about duplicate my $foo,
\&                           # but hey, you asked for it!
\&    # no compile\-time or run\-time warnings before here
\&    $DOWARN = 1;
\&
\&    # run\-time warnings enabled after here
\&    warn "\e$foo is alive and $foo!";     # does show up
.Ve
.Sp
See perlvar for details on setting \f(CW%SIG\fR entries and for more
examples.  See the Carp module for other kinds of warnings using its
\&\fIcarp()\fR and \fIcluck()\fR functions.

.IX Item "write EXPR"
.IP "write" 4
.IX Item "write"
.PD
Writes a formatted record (possibly multi-line) to the specified \s-1FILEHANDLE,\s0
using the format associated with that file.  By default the format for
a file is the one having the same name as the filehandle, but the
format for the current output channel (see the \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR function) may be set
explicitly by assigning the name of the format to the \f(CW$~\fR variable.
.Sp
Top of form processing is handled automatically:  if there is insufficient
room on the current page for the formatted record, the page is advanced by
writing a form feed, a special top-of-page format is used to format the new
page header before the record is written.  By default, the top-of-page
format is the name of the filehandle with \*(L"_TOP\*(R" appended.  This would be a
problem with autovivified filehandles, but it may be dynamically set to the
format of your choice by assigning the name to the \f(CW$^\fR variable while
that filehandle is selected.  The number of lines remaining on the current
page is in variable \f(CW\*(C`$\-\*(C'\fR, which can be set to \f(CW0\fR to force a new page.
.Sp
If \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 is unspecified, output goes to the current default output
channel, which starts out as \s-1STDOUT\s0 but may be changed by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR operator.  If the \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 is an \s-1EXPR,\s0 then the expression
is evaluated and the resulting string is used to look up the name of
the \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 at run time.  For more on formats, see perlform.

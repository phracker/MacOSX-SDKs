B::Deparse has been upgraded from version 1.03 to 1.04, to address two
regressions in Perl 5.14.0:
.Sp
Deparsing of the \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR operator and its diamond (\f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR) form now
works again. [perl #90898]
.Sp
The presence of subroutines named \f(CW\*(C`::::\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`::::::\*(C'\fR no longer causes
B::Deparse to hang.
.IP "\(bu" 4

The compiled representation of formats is now stored via the mg_ptr of
their PERL_MAGIC_fm. Previously it was stored in the string buffer,
beyond \fISvLEN()\fR, the regular end of the string. \fISvCOMPILED()\fR and
SvCOMPILED_{on,off}() now exist solely for compatibility for \s-1XS\s0 code.
The first is always 0, the other two now no-ops.
.SH "Bug Fixes"
.IX Header "Bug Fixes"
.IP "\(bu" 4
A bug has been fixed that would cause a \*(L"Use of freed value in iteration\*(R"
error if the next two hash elements that would be iterated over are
deleted. [perl #85026]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Passing the same constant subroutine to both \f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`formline\*(C'\fR no
longer causes one or the other to fail. [perl #89218]
.IP "\(bu" 4
5.14.0 introduced some memory leaks in regular expression character
classes such as \f(CW\*(C`[\ew\es]\*(C'\fR, which have now been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
An edge case in regular expression matching could potentially loop.
This happened only under \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR in bracketed character classes that have
characters with multi-character folds, and the target string to match
against includes the first portion of the fold, followed by another
character that has a multi-character fold that begins with the remaining
portion of the fold, plus some more.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& "s\eN{U+DF}" =~ /[\ex{DF}foo]/i
.Ve
.Sp
is one such case.  \f(CW\*(C`\exDF\*(C'\fR folds to \f(CW"ss"\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Several Unicode case-folding bugs have been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The new (in 5.14.0) regular expression modifier \f(CW\*(C`/a\*(C'\fR when repeated like
\&\f(CW\*(C`/aa\*(C'\fR forbids the characters outside the \s-1ASCII\s0 range that match
characters inside that range from matching under \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR.  This did not
work under some circumstances, all involving alternation, such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& "\eN{KELVIN SIGN}" =~ /k|foo/iaa;
.Ve
.Sp
succeeded inappropriately.  This is now fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have been read
from when parsing a here document.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on \s-1CPAN.\s0

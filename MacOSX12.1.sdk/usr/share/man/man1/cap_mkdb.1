.Sh NAME
.Nm cap_mkdb
.Nd create capability database
.Pp
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cap_mkdb
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl f Ar outfile
.Ar file1
.Op Ar file2 ...
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Cap_mkdb 
builds a hashed database out of the
.Xr getcap 3 
logical database constructed by the concatenation of the specified
files .
.Pp
The database is named by the basename of the first file argument and
the string
.Dq .db .  
The
.Xr getcap 3
routines can access the database in this form much more quickly
than they can the original text file(s).
.Pp
The ``tc'' capabilities of the records are expanded before the
record is stored into the database.
.Pp
The options as as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX
.It Fl f Ar outfile
Specify a different database basename.
.It Fl v
Print out the number of capability records in the database.
.El
.Pp
.Sh FORMAT
Each record is stored in the database using two different types of keys.
.Pp
The first type is a key which consists of the first capability of
the record (not including the trailing colon (``:'')) with a data
field consisting of a special byte followed by the rest of the record.
The special byte is either a 0 or 1, where a 0 means that the record
is okay, and a 1 means that there was a ``tc'' capability in the record
that couldn't be expanded.
.Pp
The second type is a key which consists of one of the names from the
first capability of the record with a data field consisting a special
byte followed by the the first capability of the record.
The special byte is a 2.
.Pp
In normal operation names are looked up in the database, resulting
in a key/data pair of the second type.
The data field of this key/data pair is used to look up a key/data
pair of the first type which has the real data associated with the
name.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
The
.Nm cap_mkdb 
utility exits 0 on success and >0 if an error occurs.

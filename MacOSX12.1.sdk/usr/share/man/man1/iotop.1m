.SH NAME
iotop \- display top disk I/O events by process. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iotop
[\-C] [\-D|\-o|\-P] [\-j|\-Z] [\-d device] [\-f filename]
[\-m mount_point] [\-t top] [interval [count]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
iotop tracks disk I/O by process, and prints a summary report that
is refreshed every interval.

This is measuring disk events that have made it past system caches.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

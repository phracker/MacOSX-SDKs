.Sh NAME
.Nm ipcs
.Nd report System V interprocess communication facilities status
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ipcs
.Op Fl abcMmopQqSsTt
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ipcs
utility provides information on System V interprocess communication
(IPC) facilities on the system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Show the maximum amount of information possible when
displaying active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
(This is shorthand for specifying the
.Fl b ,
.Fl c ,
.Fl o ,
.Fl p ,
and
.Fl t
options.)
.It Fl b
Show the maximum allowed sizes for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.  The
.Dq maximum allowed size
is the maximum number of bytes in a message on a message queue,
the size of a shared memory segment,
or the number of semaphores in a set of semaphores.
.It Fl c
Show the creator's name and group for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
.It Fl M
Display system information about shared memory.
.It Fl m
Display information about active shared memory segments.
.It Fl o
Show outstanding usage for active message queues,
and shared memory segments.  The
.Dq outstanding usage
is the number of messages in a message queue, or the number
of processes attached to a shared memory segment.
.It Fl p
Show the process ID information for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.  The
.Dq process ID information
is the last process to send a message to or receive a message from
a message queue,
the process that created a semaphore, or the last process to attach
or detach a shared memory segment.
.It Fl Q
Display system information about messages queues.
.It Fl q
Display information about active message queues.
.It Fl S
Display system information about semaphores.
.It Fl s
Display information about active semaphores.
.It Fl T
Display system information about shared memory, message queues
and semaphores.
.It Fl t
Show access times for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.  The access times is the time
of the last control operation on an IPC object,
the last send or receive of a message,
the last attach or detach of a shared memory segment,
or the last operation on a semaphore.
.El
.Pp
If none of the
.Fl M ,
.Fl m ,
.Fl Q ,
.Fl q ,
.Fl S ,
or
.Fl s
options are specified, information about all active IPC facilities is
listed.
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
System data structures may change while
.Nm ipcs
is running; the output of
.Nm ipcs
is not guaranteed to be consistent.
.Sh BUGS
This manual page is woefully incomplete, because it does not
at all attempt to explain the information printed by
.Nm ipcs .

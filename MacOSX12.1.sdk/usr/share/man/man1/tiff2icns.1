.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
can be used to convert TIFF images to 'icns' files used by Icon Services.
.Pp
Searches for 48, 32, 16, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 wide images (in that order) and converts
them to icons. Doesn't do any scaling, doesn't generate mini (12x12) icons.
If no 32x32 image was found, and the \fB-noLarge\fR flag was not passed, one is generated by scaling the image. 
.Pp
If no output file is specified, output is written to a file whose name is the 
input file name, with the original extension replaced by '.icns'.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-noLarge"
.It Fl noLarge
.Nm 
always creates a large 32x32 icon unless the \fB-noLarge\fR flag is passed.

.TH iosnoop 1m  "Jul 25, 2005" "version 1.50" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
iosnoop \- snoop I/O events as they occur. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iosnoop
[\-a|\-A|\-Deghinostv] [\-d device] [\-f filename] [\-m mount_point]
[\-n name] [\-p PID]
.SH DESCRIPTION
iosnoop prints I/O events as they happen, with useful details such
as UID, PID, block number, size, filename, etc.

This is useful to determine the process responsible for 
using the disks, as well as details on what activity the process
is requesting. Behaviour such as random or sequential I/O can
be observed by reading the block numbers.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

.SH FIELDS
.TP
UID
User ID
.TP
PID
Process ID
.TP
PPID
Parent Process ID
.TP
COMM
command name for the process
.TP
ARGS
argument listing for the process
.TP
SIZE
size of the operation, bytes
.TP
BLOCK
disk block for the operation (location. relative to this filesystem.
more useful with the -N option to print major and minor numbers)
.TP
STIME
timestamp for the disk request, us
.TP
TIME
timestamp for the disk completion, us
.TP
DELTA
elapsed time from request to completion, us (this is the elapsed 
time from the disk request (strategy) to the disk completion (iodone))
.TP
DTIME
time for disk to complete request, us (this is the time for the 
disk to complete that event since it's last event (time between iodones),
or, the time to the strategy if the disk had been idle)
.TP
STRTIME
timestamp for the disk completion, string
.TP
DEVICE
device name
.TP
INS
device instance number
.TP
D
direction, Read or Write
.TP
MOUNT
mount point
.TP
FILE
filename (basename) for I/O operation
.PP
.SH NOTES
When filtering on PID or process name, be aware that poor disk event
times may be due to events that have been filtered away, for example
another process that may be seeking the disk heads elsewhere.

Docs directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked

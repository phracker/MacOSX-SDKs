.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tfmtodit
creates a font file for use with
.B
groff \-Tdvi\fR.
.I tfm_file
is the name of the \*(tx font metric file for the font.
.I map_file
is a file giving the groff names for characters in the font;
this file should consist of a sequence of lines of the form:
.IP
.I
n c1 c2 \fR.\|.\|.
.LP
where
.I n
is a decimal integer giving the position of the character in the font,
and
.IR c1 ,
.IR c2 ,.\|.\|.
are the groff names of the character.
If a character has no groff names but exists in the tfm file,
then it will be put in the groff font file as an unnamed character.
.I font
is the name of the groff font file.
The groff font file is written to
.IR font .
.LP
The
.B \-s
option should be given if the font is special
(a font is
.I special
if
.B troff
should search it whenever
a character is not found in the current font.)
If the font is special,
it should be listed in the
.B fonts
command in the DESC file;
if it is not special, there is no need to list it, since
.B troff
can automatically mount it when it's first used.
.LP
To do a good job of math typesetting, groff requires
font metric information not present in the tfm file.
The reason for this is that \*(tx has separate math italic fonts
whereas groff uses normal italic fonts for math.
The additional information required by groff is given by the
two arguments to the
.B math_fit
macro in the Metafont programs for the Computer Modern fonts.
In a text font (a font for which
.B math_fitting
is false), Metafont normally ignores these two arguments.
Metafont can be made to put this information in the gf file
by loading the following definition after
.B cmbase
when creating
.BR cm.base :
.IP
.nf
.ft B
def ignore_math_fit(expr left_adjustment,right_adjustment) =
    special "adjustment";
    numspecial left_adjustment*16/designsize;
    numspecial right_adjustment*16/designsize;
    enddef;
.fi
.ft R
.LP
For the EC font family, load the following definition after
.B exbase
(it is probably easiest to patch
.B exbase.mf
locally):
.IP
.nf
.ft B
def ignore_math_fit(expr left_adjustment,right_adjustment) =
    ori_special "adjustment";
    ori_numspecial left_adjustment*16/designsize;
    ori_numspecial right_adjustment*16/designsize;
    enddef;
.fi
.ft R
.LP
The gf file created using this modified
.B cm.base
or
.B exbase
should be specified with the
.B \-g
option.
The
.B \-g
option should not be given for a font for which
.B math_fitting
is true.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.TP
.B \-s
The font is special.
The effect of this option is to add the
.B special
command to the font file.
.TP
.BI \-k n
The skewchar of this font is at position
.IR n .
.I n
should be an integer;
it may be given in decimal,
or with a leading 
.B 0
in octal,
or with a leading
.B 0x
in hexadecimal.
The effect of this option is to ignore any kerns whose second component
is the specified character.
.TP
.BI \-g gf_file
.I gf_file
is a gf file produced by Metafont containing special and numspecial
commands giving additional font metric information.

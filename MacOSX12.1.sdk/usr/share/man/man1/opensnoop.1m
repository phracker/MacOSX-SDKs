.TH opensnoop 1m  "Jan 12, 2006" "version 1.60" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
opensnoop \- snoop file opens as they occur. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opensnoop
[\-a|\-A|\-ceFghstvxZ] [\-f pathname] [\-n name] [\-p PID]
.SH DESCRIPTION
opensnoop tracks file opens. As a process issues a file open, details
such as UID, PID and pathname are printed out. 

The returned file descriptor is printed,
a value of -1 indicates an error. This can be useful
for troubleshooting to determine if applications are attempting to
open files that do not exist.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

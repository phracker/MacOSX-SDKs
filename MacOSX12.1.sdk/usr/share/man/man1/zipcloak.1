Note:
The encryption code of this program is not copyrighted and is put in
the public domain.  It was originally written in Europe and can be freely
distributed from any country including the U.S.A.  (Previously if this
program was imported into the U.S.A, it could not be re-exported from
the U.S.A to another country.)  See the file README.CR included in the
source distribution for more on this.  Otherwise, the Info-ZIP license
applies.

.SH EXAMPLES
To be added.

.SH BUGS
Large files (> 2 GB) and large archives not yet supported.

Split archives not yet supported.  A work around is to convert the
split archive to a single-file archive using \fIzip\fP and then
use \fIzipcloak\fP on the single-file archive.  If needed, the
resulting archive can then be split again using \fIzip\fP.

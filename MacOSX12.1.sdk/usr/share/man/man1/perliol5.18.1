.SH "NAME"
perliol \- C API for Perl's implementation of IO in Layers.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&    /* Defining a layer ... */
\&    #include <perliol.h>
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes the behavior and implementation of the PerlIO
abstraction described in perlapio when \f(CW\*(C`USE_PERLIO\*(C'\fR is defined (and
\&\f(CW\*(C`USE_SFIO\*(C'\fR is not).
.SS "History and Background"
.IX Subsection "History and Background"
The PerlIO abstraction was introduced in perl5.003_02 but languished as
just an abstraction until perl5.7.0. However during that time a number
of perl extensions switched to using it, so the \s-1API\s0 is mostly fixed to
maintain (source) compatibility.
.PP
The aim of the implementation is to provide the PerlIO \s-1API\s0 in a flexible
and platform neutral manner. It is also a trial of an \*(L"Object Oriented
C, with vtables\*(R" approach which may be applied to Perl 6.
.SS "Basic Structure"
.IX Subsection "Basic Structure"
PerlIO is a stack of layers.
.PP
The low levels of the stack work with the low-level operating system
calls (file descriptors in C) getting bytes in and out, the higher
layers of the stack buffer, filter, and otherwise manipulate the I/O,
and return characters (or bytes) to Perl.  Terms \fIabove\fR and \fIbelow\fR
are used to refer to the relative positioning of the stack layers.
.PP
A layer contains a \*(L"vtable\*(R", the table of I/O operations (at C level
a table of function pointers), and status flags.  The functions in the
vtable implement operations like \*(L"open\*(R", \*(L"read\*(R", and \*(L"write\*(R".
.PP
When I/O, for example \*(L"read\*(R", is requested, the request goes from Perl
first down the stack using \*(L"read\*(R" functions of each layer, then at the
bottom the input is requested from the operating system services, then
the result is returned up the stack, finally being interpreted as Perl
data.
.PP
The requests do not necessarily go always all the way down to the
operating system: that's where PerlIO buffering comes into play.
.PP
When you do an \fIopen()\fR and specify extra PerlIO layers to be deployed,
the layers you specify are \*(L"pushed\*(R" on top of the already existing
default stack.  One way to see it is that \*(L"operating system is
on the left\*(R" and \*(L"Perl is on the right\*(R".
.PP
What exact layers are in this default stack depends on a lot of
things: your operating system, Perl version, Perl compile time
configuration, and Perl runtime configuration.  See PerlIO,
\&\*(L"\s-1PERLIO\*(R"\s0 in perlrun, and open for more information.
.PP
\&\fIbinmode()\fR operates similarly to \fIopen()\fR: by default the specified
layers are pushed on top of the existing stack.
.PP
However, note that even as the specified layers are \*(L"pushed on top\*(R"
for \fIopen()\fR and \fIbinmode()\fR, this doesn't mean that the effects are
limited to the \*(L"top\*(R": PerlIO layers can be very 'active' and inspect
and affect layers also deeper in the stack.  As an example there
is a layer called \*(L"raw\*(R" which repeatedly \*(L"pops\*(R" layers until
it reaches the first layer that has declared itself capable of
handling binary data.  The \*(L"pushed\*(R" layers are processed in left-to-right
order.
.PP
\&\fIsysopen()\fR operates (unsurprisingly) at a lower level in the stack than
\&\fIopen()\fR.  For example in Unix or Unix-like systems \fIsysopen()\fR operates
directly at the level of file descriptors: in the terms of PerlIO
layers, it uses only the \*(L"unix\*(R" layer, which is a rather thin wrapper
on top of the Unix file descriptors.
.SS "Layers vs Disciplines"
.IX Subsection "Layers vs Disciplines"
Initial discussion of the ability to modify \s-1IO\s0 streams behaviour used
the term \*(L"discipline\*(R" for the entities which were added. This came (I
believe) from the use of the term in \*(L"sfio\*(R", which in turn borrowed it
from \*(L"line disciplines\*(R" on Unix terminals. However, this document (and
the C code) uses the term \*(L"layer\*(R".
.PP
This is, I hope, a natural term given the implementation, and should
avoid connotations that are inherent in earlier uses of \*(L"discipline\*(R"
for things which are rather different.
.SS "Data Structures"
.IX Subsection "Data Structures"
The basic data structure is a PerlIOl:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        typedef struct _PerlIO PerlIOl;
\&        typedef struct _PerlIO_funcs PerlIO_funcs;
\&        typedef PerlIOl *PerlIO;
\&
\&        struct _PerlIO
\&        {
\&         PerlIOl *      next;       /* Lower layer */
\&         PerlIO_funcs * tab;        /* Functions for this layer */
\&         IV             flags;      /* Various flags for state */
\&        };
.Ve
.PP
A \f(CW\*(C`PerlIOl *\*(C'\fR is a pointer to the struct, and the \fIapplication\fR
level \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR is a pointer to a \f(CW\*(C`PerlIOl *\*(C'\fR \- i.e. a pointer
to a pointer to the struct. This allows the application level \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR
to remain constant while the actual \f(CW\*(C`PerlIOl *\*(C'\fR underneath
changes. (Compare perl's \f(CW\*(C`SV *\*(C'\fR which remains constant while its
\&\f(CW\*(C`sv_any\*(C'\fR field changes as the scalar's type changes.) An \s-1IO\s0 stream is
then in general represented as a pointer to this linked-list of
\&\*(L"layers\*(R".
.PP
It should be noted that because of the double indirection in a \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR,
a \f(CW\*(C`&(perlio\->next)\*(C'\fR \*(L"is\*(R" a \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR, and so to some degree
at least one layer can use the \*(L"standard\*(R" \s-1API\s0 on the next layer down.
.PP
A \*(L"layer\*(R" is composed of two parts:
.IP "1." 4
The functions and attributes of the \*(L"layer class\*(R".
.IP "2." 4
The per-instance data for a particular handle.
.SS "Functions and Attributes"
.IX Subsection "Functions and Attributes"
The functions and attributes are accessed via the \*(L"tab\*(R" (for table)
member of \f(CW\*(C`PerlIOl\*(C'\fR. The functions (methods of the layer \*(L"class\*(R") are
fixed, and are defined by the \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_funcs\*(C'\fR type. They are broadly the
same as the public \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_xxxxx\*(C'\fR functions:
.PP

\&  };
.Ve
.PP
The first few members of the struct give a function table size for
compatibility check \*(L"name\*(R" for the layer, the  size to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR for the per-instance data,
and some flags which are attributes of the class as whole (such as whether it is a buffering
layer), then follow the functions which fall into four basic groups:
.IP "1." 4
Opening and setup functions
.IP "2." 4
Basic \s-1IO\s0 operations
.IP "3." 4
Stdio class buffering options.
.IP "4." 4
Functions to support Perl's traditional \*(L"fast\*(R" access to the buffer.
.PP
A layer does not have to implement all the functions, but the whole
table has to be present. Unimplemented slots can be \s-1NULL \s0(which will
result in an error when called) or can be filled in with stubs to
\&\*(L"inherit\*(R" behaviour from a \*(L"base class\*(R". This \*(L"inheritance\*(R" is fixed
for all instances of the layer, but as the layer chooses which stubs
to populate the table, limited \*(L"multiple inheritance\*(R" is possible.
.SS "Per-instance Data"
.IX Subsection "Per-instance Data"
The per-instance data are held in memory beyond the basic PerlIOl
struct, by making a PerlIOl the first member of the layer's struct
thus:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&        typedef struct
\&        {
\&         struct _PerlIO base;       /* Base "class" info */
\&         STDCHAR *      buf;        /* Start of buffer */
\&         STDCHAR *      end;        /* End of valid part of buffer */
\&         STDCHAR *      ptr;        /* Current position in buffer */
\&         Off_t          posn;       /* Offset of buf into the file */
\&         Size_t         bufsiz;     /* Real size of buffer */
\&         IV             oneword;    /* Emergency buffer */
\&        } PerlIOBuf;
.Ve
.PP
In this way (as for perl's scalars) a pointer to a PerlIOBuf can be
treated as a pointer to a PerlIOl.

.PP
The above attempts to show how the layer scheme works in a simple case.
The application's \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR points to an entry in the table(s)
representing open (allocated) handles. For example the first three slots
in the table correspond to \f(CW\*(C`stdin\*(C'\fR,\f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR. The table
in turn points to the current \*(L"top\*(R" layer for the handle \- in this case
an instance of the generic buffering layer \*(L"perlio\*(R". That layer in turn
points to the next layer down \- in this case the low-level \*(L"unix\*(R" layer.
.PP
The above is roughly equivalent to a \*(L"stdio\*(R" buffered stream, but with
much more flexibility:
.IP "\(bu" 4
If Unix level \f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`lseek\*(C'\fR is not appropriate for (say)
sockets then the \*(L"unix\*(R" layer can be replaced (at open time or even
dynamically) with a \*(L"socket\*(R" layer.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Different handles can have different buffering schemes. The \*(L"top\*(R"
layer could be the \*(L"mmap\*(R" layer if reading disk files was quicker
using \f(CW\*(C`mmap\*(C'\fR than \f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR. An \*(L"unbuffered\*(R" stream can be implemented
simply by not having a buffer layer.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Extra layers can be inserted to process the data as it flows through.
This was the driving need for including the scheme in perl 5.7.0+ \- we
needed a mechanism to allow data to be translated between perl's
internal encoding (conceptually at least Unicode as \s-1UTF\-8\s0), and the
\&\*(L"native\*(R" format used by the system. This is provided by the
\&\*(L":encoding(xxxx)\*(R" layer which typically sits above the buffering layer.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A layer can be added that does \*(L"\en\*(R" to \s-1CRLF\s0 translation. This layer
can be used on any platform, not just those that normally do such
things.
.SS "Per-instance flag bits"
.IX Subsection "Per-instance flag bits"
The generic flag bits are a hybrid of \f(CW\*(C`O_XXXXX\*(C'\fR style flags deduced
from the mode string passed to \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_open()\*(C'\fR, and state bits for
typical buffer layers.
.IP "\s-1PERLIO_F_EOF\s0" 4

End of file.
.IP "\s-1PERLIO_F_CANWRITE\s0" 4

Layer is performing Win32\-like \*(L"\en\*(R" mapped to \s-1CR,LF\s0 for output and \s-1CR,LF\s0
mapped to \*(L"\en\*(R" for input. Normally the provided \*(L"crlf\*(R" layer is the only
layer that need bother about this. \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_binmode()\*(C'\fR will mess with this
flag rather than add/remove layers if the \f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_K_CANCRLF\*(C'\fR bit is set
for the layers class.
.IP "\s-1PERLIO_F_UTF8\s0" 4
.IX Item "PERLIO_F_UTF8"
Data written to this layer should be \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded; data provided
by this layer should be considered \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded. Can be set on any layer
by \*(L":utf8\*(R" dummy layer. Also set on \*(L":encoding\*(R" layer.
.IP "\s-1PERLIO_F_UNBUF\s0" 4

This instance of this layer supports the "fast \f(CW\*(C`gets\*(C'\fR" interface.
Normally set based on \f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_K_FASTGETS\*(C'\fR for the class and by the
existence of the function(s) in the table. However a class that
normally provides that interface may need to avoid it on a
particular instance. The \*(L"pending\*(R" layer needs to do this when
it is pushed above a layer which does not support the interface.
(Perl's \f(CW\*(C`sv_gets()\*(C'\fR does not expect the streams fast \f(CW\*(C`gets\*(C'\fR behaviour
to change during one \*(L"get\*(R".)

The name of the layer whose \fIopen()\fR method Perl should invoke on

.Sp
.Vb 1

implemented by the \s-1APR\s0 layer.

.Sp
If this field is zero then \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_pushed\*(C'\fR does not malloc anything

.Vb 1
\&        IV      (*Pushed)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,const char *mode, SV *arg);
.Ve
.Sp
The only absolutely mandatory method. Called when the layer is pushed
onto the stack.  The \f(CW\*(C`mode\*(C'\fR argument may be \s-1NULL\s0 if this occurs
post-open. The \f(CW\*(C`arg\*(C'\fR will be non\-\f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR if an argument string was
passed. In most cases this should call \f(CW\*(C`PerlIOBase_pushed()\*(C'\fR to
convert \f(CW\*(C`mode\*(C'\fR into the appropriate \f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_F_XXXXX\*(C'\fR flags in
addition to any actions the layer itself takes.  If a layer is not
expecting an argument it need neither save the one passed to it, nor
provide \f(CW\*(C`Getarg()\*(C'\fR (it could perhaps \f(CW\*(C`Perl_warn\*(C'\fR that the argument
was un-expected).

.IP "Popped" 4
.IX Item "Popped"
.Vb 1
\&        IV      (*Popped)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
.Ve
.Sp
Called when the layer is popped from the stack. A layer will normally
be popped after \f(CW\*(C`Close()\*(C'\fR is called. But a layer can be popped
without being closed if the program is dynamically managing layers on
the stream. In such cases \f(CW\*(C`Popped()\*(C'\fR should free any resources
(buffers, translation tables, ...) not held directly in the layer's
struct.  It should also \f(CW\*(C`Unread()\*(C'\fR any unconsumed data that has been
read and buffered from the layer below back to that layer, so that it
can be re-provided to what ever is now above.
.Sp
Returns 0 on success and failure.  If \f(CW\*(C`Popped()\*(C'\fR returns \fItrue\fR then
\&\fIperlio.c\fR assumes that either the layer has popped itself, or the
layer is super special and needs to be retained for other reasons.
In most cases it should return \fIfalse\fR.
.IP "Open" 4
.IX Item "Open"
.Vb 1
\&        PerlIO *        (*Open)(...);
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`Open()\*(C'\fR method has lots of arguments because it combines the
functions of perl's \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_open\*(C'\fR, perl's \f(CW\*(C`sysopen\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_fdopen\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_reopen\*(C'\fR.  The full prototype is as
follows:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\& PerlIO *       (*Open)(pTHX_ PerlIO_funcs *tab,
\&                        PerlIO_list_t *layers, IV n,
\&                        const char *mode,
\&                        int fd, int imode, int perm,
\&                        PerlIO *old,
\&                        int narg, SV **args);
.Ve
.Sp
Open should (perhaps indirectly) call \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_allocate()\*(C'\fR to allocate
a slot in the table and associate it with the layers information for
the opened file, by calling \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_push\*(C'\fR.  The \fIlayers\fR is an
array of all the layers destined for the \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR, and any
arguments passed to them, \fIn\fR is the index into that array of the
layer being called. The macro \f(CW\*(C`PerlIOArg\*(C'\fR will return a (possibly
\&\f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR) \s-1SV\s0 * for the argument passed to the layer.
.Sp
The \fImode\fR string is an "\f(CW\*(C`fopen()\*(C'\fR\-like" string which would match
the regular expression \f(CW\*(C`/^[I#]?[rwa]\e+?[bt]?$/\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(AqI\*(Aq\fR prefix is used during creation of \f(CW\*(C`stdin\*(C'\fR..\f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR via
special \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_fdopen\*(C'\fR calls; the \f(CW\*(Aq#\*(Aq\fR prefix means that this is
\&\f(CW\*(C`sysopen\*(C'\fR and that \fIimode\fR and \fIperm\fR should be passed to
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlLIO_open3\*(C'\fR; \f(CW\*(Aqr\*(Aq\fR means \fBr\fRead, \f(CW\*(Aqw\*(Aq\fR means \fBw\fRrite and
\&\f(CW\*(Aqa\*(Aq\fR means \fBa\fRppend. The \f(CW\*(Aq+\*(Aq\fR suffix means that both reading and
writing/appending are permitted.  The \f(CW\*(Aqb\*(Aq\fR suffix means file should
be binary, and \f(CW\*(Aqt\*(Aq\fR means it is text. (Almost all layers should do
the \s-1IO\s0 in binary mode, and ignore the b/t bits. The \f(CW\*(C`:crlf\*(C'\fR layer
should be pushed to handle the distinction.)
.Sp
If \fIold\fR is not \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR then this is a \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_reopen\*(C'\fR. Perl itself
does not use this (yet?) and semantics are a little vague.
.Sp
If \fIfd\fR not negative then it is the numeric file descriptor \fIfd\fR,
which will be open in a manner compatible with the supplied mode
string, the call is thus equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_fdopen\*(C'\fR. In this case
\&\fInargs\fR will be zero.
.Sp
If \fInargs\fR is greater than zero then it gives the number of arguments
passed to \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR, otherwise it will be 1 if for example
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_open\*(C'\fR was called.  In simple cases SvPV_nolen(*args) is the
pathname to open.
.Sp
If a layer provides \f(CW\*(C`Open()\*(C'\fR it should normally call the \f(CW\*(C`Open()\*(C'\fR
method of next layer down (if any) and then push itself on top if that
succeeds.  \f(CW\*(C`PerlIOBase_open\*(C'\fR is provided to do exactly that, so in
most cases you don't have to write your own \f(CW\*(C`Open()\*(C'\fR method.  If this
method is not defined, other layers may have difficulty pushing
themselves on top of it during open.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_push\*(C'\fR was performed and open has failed, it must
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_pop\*(C'\fR itself, since if it's not, the layer won't be removed
and may cause bad problems.
.Sp
Returns \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR on failure.
.IP "Binmode" 4
.IX Item "Binmode"
.Vb 1
\&        IV        (*Binmode)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);
.Ve
.Sp
Optional. Used when \f(CW\*(C`:raw\*(C'\fR layer is pushed (explicitly or as a result
of binmode(\s-1FH\s0)). If not present layer will be popped. If present
should configure layer as binary (or pop itself) and return 0.
If it returns \-1 for error \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR will fail with layer
still on the stack.
.IP "Getarg" 4
.IX Item "Getarg"
.Vb 2
\&        SV *      (*Getarg)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,
\&                            CLONE_PARAMS *param, int flags);
.Ve
.Sp
Optional. If present should return an \s-1SV\s0 * representing the string
argument passed to the layer when it was
pushed. e.g. \*(L":encoding(ascii)\*(R" would return an SvPV with value
\&\*(L"ascii\*(R". (\fIparam\fR and \fIflags\fR arguments can be ignored in most
cases)
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Dup\*(C'\fR uses \f(CW\*(C`Getarg\*(C'\fR to retrieve the argument originally passed to
\&\f(CW\*(C`Pushed\*(C'\fR, so you must implement this function if your layer has an
extra argument to \f(CW\*(C`Pushed\*(C'\fR and will ever be \f(CW\*(C`Dup\*(C'\fRed.
.IP "Fileno" 4
.IX Item "Fileno"
.Vb 1
\&        IV        (*Fileno)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);

.Sp
Returns the Unix/Posix numeric file descriptor for the handle. Normally
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIOBase_fileno()\*(C'\fR (which just asks next layer down) will suffice
for this.
.Sp
Returns \-1 on error, which is considered to include the case where the
layer cannot provide such a file descriptor.

Used as part of the \*(L"clone\*(R" process when a thread is spawned (in which
case param will be non-NULL) and when a stream is being duplicated via
\&'&' in the \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR.

.Sp
A superset of stdio's \f(CW\*(C`ungetc()\*(C'\fR. Should arrange for future reads to
see the bytes in \f(CW\*(C`vbuf\*(C'\fR. If there is no obviously better implementation
then \f(CW\*(C`PerlIOBase_unread()\*(C'\fR provides the function by pushing a \*(L"fake\*(R"

A basic non-buffered layer which calls Unix/POSIX \f(CW\*(C`read()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`write()\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`lseek()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`close()\*(C'\fR. No buffering. Even on platforms that distinguish
between O_TEXT and O_BINARY this layer is always O_BINARY.
.ie n .IP """perlio""" 4
.el .IP "``perlio''" 4
.IX Item "perlio"
A very complete generic buffering layer which provides the whole of
PerlIO \s-1API.\s0 It is also intended to be used as a \*(L"base class\*(R" for other
layers. (For example its \f(CW\*(C`Read()\*(C'\fR method is implemented in terms of
the \f(CW\*(C`Get_cnt()\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`Get_ptr()\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`Set_ptrcnt()\*(C'\fR methods).
.Sp
\&\*(L"perlio\*(R" over \*(L"unix\*(R" provides a complete replacement for stdio as seen
via PerlIO \s-1API.\s0 This is the default for \s-1USE_PERLIO\s0 when system's stdio
does not permit perl's \*(L"fast gets\*(R" access, and which do not
distinguish between \f(CW\*(C`O_TEXT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`O_BINARY\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP """stdio""" 4
.el .IP "``stdio''" 4
.IX Item "stdio"
A layer which provides the PerlIO \s-1API\s0 via the layer scheme, but
implements it by calling system's stdio. This is (currently) the default
if system's stdio provides sufficient access to allow perl's \*(L"fast gets\*(R"
access and which do not distinguish between \f(CW\*(C`O_TEXT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`O_BINARY\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP """crlf""" 4
.el .IP "``crlf''" 4
.IX Item "crlf"
A layer derived using \*(L"perlio\*(R" as a base class. It provides Win32\-like
\&\*(L"\en\*(R" to \s-1CR,LF\s0 translation. Can either be applied above \*(L"perlio\*(R" or serve
as the buffer layer itself. \*(L"crlf\*(R" over \*(L"unix\*(R" is the default if system
distinguishes between \f(CW\*(C`O_TEXT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`O_BINARY\*(C'\fR opens. (At some point
\&\*(L"unix\*(R" will be replaced by a \*(L"native\*(R" Win32 \s-1IO\s0 layer on that platform,
as Win32's read/write layer has various drawbacks.) The \*(L"crlf\*(R" layer is
a reasonable model for a layer which transforms data in some way.
.ie n .IP """mmap""" 4
.el .IP "``mmap''" 4
.IX Item "mmap"
If Configure detects \f(CW\*(C`mmap()\*(C'\fR functions this layer is provided (with
\&\*(L"perlio\*(R" as a \*(L"base\*(R") which does \*(L"read\*(R" operations by \fImmap()\fRing the
file. Performance improvement is marginal on modern systems, so it is
mainly there as a proof of concept. It is likely to be unbundled from
the core at some point. The \*(L"mmap\*(R" layer is a reasonable model for a
minimalist \*(L"derived\*(R" layer.
.ie n .IP """pending""" 4
.el .IP "``pending''" 4
.IX Item "pending"
An \*(L"internal\*(R" derivative of \*(L"perlio\*(R" which can be used to provide
\&\fIUnread()\fR function for layers which have no buffer or cannot be
bothered.  (Basically this layer's \f(CW\*(C`Fill()\*(C'\fR pops itself off the stack
and so resumes reading from layer below.)
.ie n .IP """raw""" 4
.el .IP "``raw''" 4
.IX Item "raw"
A dummy layer which never exists on the layer stack. Instead when
\&\*(L"pushed\*(R" it actually pops the stack removing itself, it then calls
Binmode function table entry on all the layers in the stack \- normally
this (via PerlIOBase_binmode) removes any layers which do not have
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_K_RAW\*(C'\fR bit set. Layers can modify that behaviour by defining
their own Binmode entry.
.ie n .IP """utf8""" 4
.el .IP "``utf8''" 4
.IX Item "utf8"
Another dummy layer. When pushed it pops itself and sets the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_F_UTF8\*(C'\fR flag on the layer which was (and now is once more)
the top of the stack.
.PP
In addition \fIperlio.c\fR also provides a number of \f(CW\*(C`PerlIOBase_xxxx()\*(C'\fR
functions which are intended to be used in the table slots of classes
which do not need to do anything special for a particular method.
.SS "Extension Layers"
.IX Subsection "Extension Layers"
Layers can be made available by extension modules. When an unknown layer
is encountered the PerlIO code will perform the equivalent of :
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use PerlIO \*(Aqlayer\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
Where \fIlayer\fR is the unknown layer. \fIPerlIO.pm\fR will then attempt to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   require PerlIO::layer;
.Ve
.PP
If after that process the layer is still not defined then the \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR
will fail.
.PP
The following extension layers are bundled with perl:
.ie n .IP """:encoding""" 4
.el .IP "``:encoding''" 4
.IX Item ":encoding"
.Vb 1
\&   use Encoding;
.Ve
.Sp
makes this layer available, although \fIPerlIO.pm\fR \*(L"knows\*(R" where to
find it.  It is an example of a layer which takes an argument as it is
called thus:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   open( $fh, "<:encoding(iso\-8859\-7)", $pathname );
.Ve
.ie n .IP """:scalar""" 4
.el .IP "``:scalar''" 4
.IX Item ":scalar"
Provides support for reading data from and writing data to a scalar.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   open( $fh, "+<:scalar", \e$scalar );
.Ve
.Sp
When a handle is so opened, then reads get bytes from the string value
of \fI\f(CI$scalar\fI\fR, and writes change the value. In both cases the position
in \fI\f(CI$scalar\fI\fR starts as zero but can be altered via \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR, and
determined via \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Please note that this layer is implied when calling \fIopen()\fR thus:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   open( $fh, "+<", \e$scalar );
.Ve
.ie n .IP """:via""" 4
.el .IP "``:via''" 4
.IX Item ":via"
Provided to allow layers to be implemented as Perl code.  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   use PerlIO::via::StripHTML;
\&   open( my $fh, "<:via(StripHTML)", "index.html" );
.Ve
.Sp
See PerlIO::via for details.
.SH "TODO"
.IX Header "TODO"
Things that need to be done to improve this document.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Explain how to make a valid fh without going through \fIopen()\fR(i.e. apply
a layer). For example if the file is not opened through perl, but we
want to get back a fh, like it was opened by Perl.
.Sp
How PerlIO_apply_layera fits in, where its docs, was it made public?
.Sp
Currently the example could be something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&  PerlIO *foo_to_PerlIO(pTHX_ char *mode, ...)
\&  {
\&      char *mode; /* "w", "r", etc */
\&      const char *layers = ":APR"; /* the layer name */
\&      PerlIO *f = PerlIO_allocate(aTHX);
\&      if (!f) {
\&          return NULL;
\&      }
\&
\&      PerlIO_apply_layers(aTHX_ f, mode, layers);
\&
\&      if (f) {
\&          PerlIOAPR *st = PerlIOSelf(f, PerlIOAPR);
\&          /* fill in the st struct, as in _open() */
\&          st\->file = file;
\&          PerlIOBase(f)\->flags |= PERLIO_F_OPEN;
\&
\&          return f;
\&      }
\&      return NULL;
\&  }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
fix/add the documentation in places marked as \s-1XXX.\s0
.IP "\(bu" 4
The handling of errors by the layer is not specified. e.g. when $!
should be set explicitly, when the error handling should be just
delegated to the top layer.
.Sp
Probably give some hints on using \s-1\fISETERRNO\s0()\fR or pointers to where they
can be found.
.IP "\(bu" 4
I think it would help to give some concrete examples to make it easier
to understand the \s-1API.\s0 Of course I agree that the \s-1API\s0 has to be
concise, but since there is no second document that is more of a
guide, I think that it'd make it easier to start with the doc which is
an \s-1API,\s0 but has examples in it in places where things are unclear, to
a person who is not a PerlIO guru (yet).

.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
is a tool to convert PostScript input data into a PDF document. The input data may
come from a file or may be read from stdin. The PDF document is always written to
a file. The name of the output PDF file is derived from the name of the input file or may
be explicitly named using the -o option.

Flags:
.Bl -tag -width indent 
.It Fl o Ar outname
The name of the output file to create. If an explicit file name is not supplied, 
the output file will be created in the current directory and named 
.Ar foo.pdf 
for an input file named
.Ar foo.ps
.It Fl l
Specifies that any messages generated during file conversion be written to
a log file. For an output file named
.Ar foo.pdf
the generated log file is
.Ar foo.pdf.log
rather than generated to stdout. If there are no messages, the log file is
not generated.
.It Fl p
Generates a simple progress message to stdout at the end of each page. Because conversion
of complex or lengthy PostScript input can take time, it is sometimes useful to
see that progress is being made. Progress messages are always written to stdout even
when the -l (log file) option is specified.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width "pstopdf -o outputfilename" -compact

from the PostScript data in the input file 
.Ar inputfile.ps
.Pp

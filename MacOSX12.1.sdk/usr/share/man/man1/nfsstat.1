.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays statistics kept about
.Tn NFS
client and server activity, active user activity,
exported directories, and mount information.
In the absence of any options,
.Nm
displays NFS client and server statistics.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Show NFS client statistics.
.It Fl e
Show NFS server exported directory statistics.
.It Fl m [ Ar mountpath ]
Show NFS mount information.
.It Fl s
Show NFS server statistics.
.It Fl 3
Print only NFS v3 statistics.
.It Fl 4
Print only NFS v4 statistics.
.It Fl u
Show NFS server active user statistics.
.It Fl f Ar JSON
Print output as JSON format.
.It Fl w Ar wait
Display a shorter summary at
.Ar wait
second intervals.
.It Fl n Ar net|user
Show network addresses as numbers, or show users as uid numbers.
This option can appear multiple times.
.It Fl z
Zero NFS client and server statistics.
.It Fl v
Show additional information (if available).
.El

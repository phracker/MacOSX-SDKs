.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some optional parts of zsh are in modules, separate from the core
of the shell\&.  Each of these modules may be linked in to the
shell at build time,
or can be dynamically linked while the shell is running
if the installation supports this feature\&.
Modules are linked at runtime with the \fBzmodload\fP command,
see \fIzshbuiltins\fP(1)\&.

.SH "THE ZSH/ATTR MODULE"
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/mod_attr.yo

The \fBzsh/attr\fP module is used for manipulating extended attributes\&.
The \fB\-h\fP option causes all commands to operate on symbolic links instead
of their targets\&.
The builtins in this module are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBzgetattr\fP [ \fB\-h\fP ] \fIfilename\fP \fIattribute\fP [ \fIparameter\fP ]
Get the extended attribute \fIattribute\fP from the specified
\fIfilename\fP\&. If the optional argument \fIparameter\fP is given, the
attribute is set on that parameter instead of being printed to stdout\&.
.TP
\fBzsetattr\fP [ \fB\-h\fP ] \fIfilename\fP \fIattribute\fP \fIvalue\fP
Set the extended attribute \fIattribute\fP on the specified
\fIfilename\fP to \fIvalue\fP\&.
.TP
\fBzdelattr\fP [ \fB\-h\fP ] \fIfilename\fP \fIattribute\fP
Remove the extended attribute \fIattribute\fP from the specified
\fIfilename\fP\&.
.TP
\fBzlistattr\fP [ \fB\-h\fP ] \fIfilename\fP [ \fIparameter\fP ]
List the extended attributes currently set on the specified
\fIfilename\fP\&. If the optional argument \fIparameter\fP is given, the
list of attributes is set on that parameter instead of being printed to stdout\&.
.PP
\fBzgetattr\fP and \fBzlistattr\fP allocate memory dynamically\&.  If the
attribute or list of attributes grows between the allocation and the call
to get them, they return 2\&.  On all other errors, 1 is returned\&.  This
allows the calling function to check for this case and retry\&.
.SH "THE ZSH/CAP MODULE"
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/mod_cap.yo

The \fBzsh/cap\fP module is used for manipulating POSIX\&.1e (POSIX\&.6) capability
sets\&.  If the operating system does not support this interface, the
builtins defined by this module will do nothing\&.
The builtins in this module are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBcap\fP [ \fIcapabilities\fP ]
Change the shell\&'s process capability sets to the specified \fIcapabilities\fP,
otherwise display the shell\&'s current capabilities\&.
.TP
\fBgetcap\fP \fIfilename\fP \&.\&.\&.
This is a built\-in implementation of the POSIX standard utility\&.  It displays
the capability sets on each specified \fIfilename\fP\&.
.TP
\fBsetcap\fP \fIcapabilities\fP \fIfilename\fP \&.\&.\&.
This is a built\-in implementation of the POSIX standard utility\&.  It sets
the capability sets on each specified \fIfilename\fP to the specified
\fIcapabilities\fP\&.
.SH "THE ZSH/CLONE MODULE"
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/mod_clone.yo

The \fBzsh/clone\fP module makes available one builtin command:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBclone\fP \fItty\fP
Creates a forked instance of the current shell, attached to the specified
\fItty\fP\&.  In the new shell, the \fBPID\fP, \fBPPID\fP and \fBTTY\fP special
parameters are changed appropriately\&.  \fB$!\fP is set to zero in the new
shell, and to the new shell\&'s PID in the original shell\&.
.RS
.PP
The return status of the builtin is zero in both shells if successful,
and non\-zero on error\&.
.PP
The target of \fBclone\fP should be an unused terminal, such as an unused virtual
console or a virtual terminal created by
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBxterm \-e sh \-c \&'trap : INT QUIT TSTP; tty;
        while :; do sleep 100000000; done\&'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Some words of explanation are warranted about this long xterm command
line: when doing clone on a pseudo\-terminal, some other session
("session" meant as a unix session group, or SID) is already owning
the terminal\&. Hence the cloned zsh cannot acquire the pseudo\-terminal
as a controlling tty\&. That means two things:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
the job control signals will go to the sh\-started\-by\-xterm process
group (that\&'s why we disable INT QUIT and TSTP with trap; otherwise
the while loop could get suspended or killed)
.TP
\(bu
the cloned shell will have job control disabled, and the job
control keys (control\-C, control\-\e and control\-Z) will not work\&.
.PP
This does not apply when cloning to an \fIunused\fP vc\&.
.PP
Cloning to a used (and unprepared) terminal will result in two
processes reading simultaneously from the same terminal, with
input bytes going randomly to either process\&.
.PP
\fBclone\fP is mostly useful as a shell built\-in replacement for
openvt\&.
.RE
.SH "THE ZSH/COMPCTL MODULE"
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/mod_compctl.yo

The \fBzsh/compctl\fP module makes available two builtin commands\&. \fBcompctl\fP,
is the old, deprecated way to control completions for ZLE\&.  See
\fIzshcompctl\fP(1)\&.
The other builtin command, \fBcompcall\fP can be used in user\-defined
completion widgets, see
\fIzshcompwid\fP(1)\&.
.SH "THE ZSH/COMPLETE MODULE"
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/mod_complete.yo

The \fBzsh/complete\fP module makes available several builtin commands which
can be used in user\-defined completion widgets, see
\fIzshcompwid\fP(1)\&.
.SH "THE ZSH/COMPLIST MODULE"
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/mod_complist.yo

The \fBzsh/complist\fP module offers three extensions to completion listings:
the ability to highlight matches in such a list, the ability to
scroll through long lists and a different style of menu completion\&.
.PP
.SS "Colored completion listings"
Whenever one of the parameters \fBZLS_COLORS\fP or \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP is set 
and the \fBzsh/complist\fP module is loaded or linked into the shell,
completion lists will be colored\&.  Note, however, that \fBcomplist\fP will
not automatically be loaded if it is not linked in:  on systems with
dynamic loading, `\fBzmodload zsh/complist\fP\&' is required\&.
.PP
The parameters \fBZLS_COLORS\fP and \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP describe how matches
are highlighted\&.  To turn on highlighting an empty value suffices, in
which case all the default values given below will be used\&.  The format of
the value of these parameters is the same as used by the GNU version of the
\fBls\fP command: a colon\-separated list of specifications of the form
`\fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP\&'\&.  The \fIname\fP may be one of the following strings,
most of which specify file types for which the \fIvalue\fP will be used\&.
The strings and their default values are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBno 0\fP
for normal text (i\&.e\&. when displaying something other than a matched file)
.TP
\fBfi 0\fP
for regular files
.TP
\fBdi 32\fP
for directories
.TP
\fBln 36\fP
for symbolic links\&.  If this has the special value \fBtarget\fP,
symbolic links are dereferenced and the target file used to
determine the display format\&.
.TP
\fBpi 31\fP
for named pipes (FIFOs)
.TP
\fBso 33\fP
for sockets
.TP
\fBbd 44;37\fP
for block devices
.TP
\fBcd 44;37\fP
for character devices
.TP
\fBor\fP \fInone\fP
for a symlink to nonexistent file (default is the value defined for \fBln\fP)
.TP
\fBmi\fP \fInone\fP
for a non\-existent file (default is the value defined for \fBfi\fP); this code
is currently not used
.TP
\fBsu 37;41\fP
for files with setuid bit set
.TP
\fBsg 30;43\fP
for files with setgid bit set
.TP
\fBtw 30;42\fP
for world writable directories with sticky bit set
.TP
\fBow 34;43\fP
for world writable directories without sticky bit set
.TP
\fBsa\fP \fInone\fP
for files with an associated suffix alias; this is only tested
after specific suffixes, as described below
.TP
\fBst 37;44\fP
for directories with sticky bit set but not world writable
.TP
\fBex 35\fP
for executable files
.TP
\fBlc \ee[\fP
for the left code (see below)
.TP
\fBrc m\fP
for the right code
.TP
\fBtc 0\fP
for the character indicating the file type  printed after filenames if
the \fBLIST_TYPES\fP option is set
.TP
\fBsp 0\fP
for the spaces printed after matches to align the next column
.TP
\fBec\fP \fInone\fP
for the end code
.PP
Apart from these strings, the \fIname\fP may also be an asterisk
(`\fB*\fP\&') followed by any string\&. The \fIvalue\fP given for such a
string will be used for all files whose name ends with the string\&.
The \fIname\fP may also be an equals sign (`\fB=\fP\&') followed by a
pattern; the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP option will be turned on for evaluation
of the pattern\&.  The \fIvalue\fP given for this pattern will be used for all
matches (not just filenames) whose display string are matched by
the pattern\&.  Definitions for the form with the leading equal sign take
precedence over the values defined for file types, which in turn take
precedence over the form with the leading asterisk (file extensions)\&.
.PP
The leading\-equals form also allows different parts of the displayed
strings to be colored differently\&.  For this, the pattern has to use the
`\fB(#b)\fP\&' globbing flag and pairs of parentheses surrounding the
parts of the strings that are to be colored differently\&.  In this case 
the \fIvalue\fP may consist of more than one color code separated by
equal signs\&.  The first code will be used for all parts for which no
explicit code is specified and the following codes will be used for
the parts matched by the sub\-patterns in parentheses\&.  For example,
the specification `\fB=(#b)(?)*(?)=0=3=7\fP\&' will be used for all
matches which are at least two characters long and will use
the code `\fB3\fP\&' for the first character, `\fB7\fP' for the last
character and `\fB0\fP\&' for the rest\&.
.PP
All three forms of \fIname\fP may be preceded by a pattern in
parentheses\&.  If this is given, the \fIvalue\fP will be used
only for matches in groups whose names are matched by the pattern
given in the parentheses\&.  For example, `\fB(g*)m*=43\fP\&' highlights all
matches beginning with `\fBm\fP\&' in groups whose names  begin with
`\fBg\fP\&' using the color code `\fB43\fP'\&.  In case of the `\fBlc\fP',
`\fBrc\fP\&', and `\fBec\fP' codes, the group pattern is ignored\&.
.PP
Note also that all patterns are tried in the order in which they
appear in the parameter value until the first one matches which is
then used\&.  Patterns may be matched against completions, descriptions
(possibly with spaces appended for padding), or lines consisting of a
completion followed by a description\&.  For consistent coloring it may be
necessary to use more than one pattern or a pattern with backreferences\&.
.PP
When printing a match, the code prints the value of \fBlc\fP, the value
for the file\-type or the last matching specification with a `\fB*\fP\&',
the value of \fBrc\fP, the string to display for the match itself, and
then the value of \fBec\fP if that is defined or the values of \fBlc\fP,
\fBno\fP, and \fBrc\fP if \fBec\fP is not defined\&.
.PP
The default values are ISO 6429 (ANSI) compliant and can be used on
vt100 compatible terminals such as \fBxterm\fPs\&.  On monochrome terminals
the default values will have no visible effect\&.  The \fBcolors\fP
function from the contribution can be used to get associative arrays
containing the codes for ANSI terminals (see
the section `Other Functions\&' in \fIzshcontrib\fP(1))\&.  For example, after loading \fBcolors\fP, one could use
`\fB$color[red]\fP\&' to get the code for foreground color red and
`\fB$color[bg\-green]\fP\&' for the code for background color green\&.
.PP
If the completion system invoked by compinit is used, these
parameters should not be set directly because the system controls them 
itself\&.  Instead, the \fBlist\-colors\fP style should be used (see
the section `Completion System Configuration\&' in \fIzshcompsys\fP(1))\&.
.PP
.SS "Scrolling in completion listings"
To enable scrolling through a completion list, the \fBLISTPROMPT\fP
parameter must be set\&.  Its value will be used as the prompt; if it
is the empty string, a default prompt will be used\&.  The value may
contain escapes of the form `\fB%x\fP\&'\&.  It supports the escapes
`\fB%B\fP\&', `\fB%b\fP', `\fB%S\fP', `\fB%s\fP', `\fB%U\fP', `\fB%u\fP', `\fB%F\fP',
`\fB%f\fP\&', `\fB%K\fP', `\fB%k\fP' and
`\fB%{\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB%}\fP\&' used also in shell prompts as well as three pairs of
additional sequences: a `\fB%l\fP\&' or `\fB%L\fP' is replaced by the number
of the last line shown and the total number of lines in the form
`\fInumber\fP\fB/\fP\fItotal\fP\&'; a `\fB%m\fP' or `\fB%M\fP' is replaced with
the number of the last match shown and the total number of matches; and 
`\fB%p\fP\&' or `\fB%P\fP' is replaced with `\fBTop\fP', `\fBBottom\fP' or the
position of the first line shown in percent of the total number of
lines, respectively\&.  In each of these cases the form with the uppercase
letter will be replaced with a string of fixed width, padded to the
right with spaces, while the lowercase form will not be padded\&.
.PP
If the parameter \fBLISTPROMPT\fP is set, the completion code will not ask if
the list should be shown\&.  Instead it immediately starts displaying the
list, stopping after the first screenful, showing the prompt at the bottom,
waiting for a keypress after temporarily switching to the \fBlistscroll\fP
keymap\&.  Some of the zle functions have a special meaning while scrolling
lists:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBsend\-break\fP
stops listing discarding the key pressed
.TP
.PD 0
\fBaccept\-line\fP, \fBdown\-history\fP, \fBdown\-line\-or\-history\fP
.TP
.PD
\fBdown\-line\-or\-search\fP, \fBvi\-down\-line\-or\-history\fP
scrolls forward one line
.TP
.PD 0
\fBcomplete\-word\fP, \fBmenu\-complete\fP, \fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP
.TP
.PD
\fBexpand\-or\-complete\-prefix\fP, \fBmenu\-complete\-or\-expand\fP
scrolls forward one screenful
.TP
\fBaccept\-search\fP
stop listing but take no other action
.PP
Every other character stops listing and immediately processes the key
as usual\&.  Any key that is not bound in the \fBlistscroll\fP keymap or
that is bound to \fBundefined\-key\fP is looked up in the keymap
currently selected\&.
.PP
As for the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP and \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP parameters,
\fBLISTPROMPT\fP should not be set directly when using the shell
function based completion system\&.  Instead, the \fBlist\-prompt\fP style
should be used\&.
.PP
.SS "Menu selection"
The \fBzsh/complist\fP module also offers an alternative style of selecting
matches from a list, called menu selection, which can be used if the
shell is set up to return to the last prompt after showing a
completion list (see the \fBALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT\fP option in
\fIzshoptions\fP(1))\&.
.PP
Menu selection can be invoked directly by
the widget \fBmenu\-select\fP defined by this module\&.  This is a standard
ZLE widget that can be bound to a key in the usual way as described
in \fIzshzle\fP(1)\&.
.PP
Alternatively,
the parameter \fBMENUSELECT\fP can be set to an integer, which gives the
minimum number of matches that must be present before menu selection is
automatically turned on\&.  This second method requires that menu completion
be started, either directly from a widget such as \fBmenu\-complete\fP, or due
to one of the options \fBMENU_COMPLETE\fP or \fBAUTO_MENU\fP being set\&.  If
\fBMENUSELECT\fP is set, but is 0, 1 or empty, menu selection will always be
started during an ambiguous menu completion\&.
.PP
When using the completion system based on shell functions, the
\fBMENUSELECT\fP parameter should not be used (like the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP
and \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP parameters described above)\&.  Instead, the \fBmenu\fP 
style should be used with the \fBselect=\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP keyword\&.
.PP
After menu selection is started, the matches will be listed\&. If there
are more matches than fit on the screen, only the first screenful is
shown\&.  The
matches to insert into the command line can be selected from this
list\&.  In the list one match is highlighted using the value for \fBma\fP
from the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP or \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP parameter\&.  The default
value for this is `\fB7\fP\&' which forces the selected match to be
highlighted using standout mode on a vt100\-compatible terminal\&.  If
neither \fBZLS_COLORS\fP nor \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP is set, the same terminal
control sequence as for the `\fB%S\fP\&' escape in prompts is used\&.
.PP
If there are more matches than fit on the screen and the parameter
\fBMENUPROMPT\fP is set, its value will be shown below the matches\&.  It
supports the same escape sequences as \fBLISTPROMPT\fP, but the number
of the match or line shown will be that of the one where the mark is
placed\&.  If its value is the empty string, a default prompt will be
used\&.
.PP
The \fBMENUSCROLL\fP parameter can be used to specify how the list is
scrolled\&.  If the parameter is unset, this is done line by line, if it
is set to `\fB0\fP\&' (zero), the list will scroll half the number of
lines of the screen\&.  If the value is positive, it gives the number of
lines to scroll and if it is negative, the list will be scrolled
the number of lines of the screen minus the (absolute) value\&.
.PP
As for the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP, \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP and \fBLISTPROMPT\fP
parameters, neither \fBMENUPROMPT\fP nor \fBMENUSCROLL\fP should be
set directly when using the shell function based completion
system\&.  Instead, the \fBselect\-prompt\fP and \fBselect\-scroll\fP styles
should be used\&.
.PP
The completion code sometimes decides not to show all of the matches
in the list\&.  These hidden matches are either matches for which the
completion function which added them explicitly requested that they
not appear in the list (using the \fB\-n\fP option of the \fBcompadd\fP
builtin command) or they are matches which duplicate a string already
in the list (because they differ only in things like prefixes or
suffixes that are not displayed)\&.  In the list used for menu selection,
however, even these matches are shown so that it is possible to select
them\&.  To highlight such matches the \fBhi\fP and \fBdu\fP capabilities in
the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP and \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP parameters are supported for
hidden matches of the first and second kind, respectively\&.
.PP
Selecting matches is done by moving the mark around using the zle movement
functions\&.  When not all matches can be shown on the screen at the same 
time, the list will scroll up and down when crossing the top or
bottom line\&.  The following zle functions have special meaning during
menu selection\&.  Note that the following always
perform the same task within the menu selection map and cannot be
replaced by user defined widgets, nor can the set of functions
be extended:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBaccept\-line\fP, \fBaccept\-search\fP
accept the current match and leave menu selection (but do
not cause the command line to be accepted)
.TP
\fBsend\-break\fP

command line
.TP
\fBredisplay\fP, \fBclear\-screen\fP
execute their normal function without leaving menu selection
.TP
\fBaccept\-and\-hold\fP, \fBaccept\-and\-menu\-complete\fP
accept the currently inserted match and continue selection allowing to 
select the next match to insert into the line
.TP
\fBaccept\-and\-infer\-next\-history\fP
accepts the current match and then tries completion with
menu selection again;  in the case of files this allows one to select
a directory and immediately attempt to complete files in it;  if there 
are no matches, a message is shown and one can use \fBundo\fP to go back 
to completion on the previous level, every other key leaves menu
selection (including the other zle functions which are otherwise
special during menu selection)

list changes to contain only the new matches; the completion widgets
make the longest unambiguous string be inserted in the command line

All movement functions wrap around at the edges; any other zle function not

.SH "THE ZSH/COMPUTIL MODULE"
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/mod_computil.yo

The \fBzsh/computil\fP module adds several builtin commands that are used by
some of the completion functions in the completion system based on shell
functions (see 
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1)
)\&.  Except for \fBcompquote\fP these builtin commands are very
specialised and thus not very interesting when writing your own
completion functions\&.  In summary, these builtin commands are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBcomparguments\fP
This is used by the \fB_arguments\fP function to do the argument and
command line parsing\&.  Like \fBcompdescribe\fP it has an option \fB\-i\fP to 
do the parsing and initialize some internal state and various options
to access the state information to decide what should be completed\&.
.TP
\fBcompdescribe\fP
This is used by the \fB_describe\fP function to build the displays for
the matches and to get the strings to add as matches with their
options\&.  On the first call one of the options \fB\-i\fP or \fB\-I\fP should be
supplied as the first argument\&.  In the first case, display strings without
the descriptions will be generated, in the second case, the string used to
separate the matches from their descriptions must be given as the
second argument and the descriptions (if any) will be shown\&.  All other 
arguments are like the definition arguments to \fB_describe\fP itself\&.
.RS
.PP
Once \fBcompdescribe\fP has been called with either the \fB\-i\fP or the
\fB\-I\fP option, it can be repeatedly called with the \fB\-g\fP option and
the names of four parameters as its arguments\&.  This will step through
the different sets of matches and store the value of \fBcompstate[list]\fP
in the first scalar, the options for \fBcompadd\fP in the second array,
the matches in the third array, and the strings to be displayed in the
completion listing in the fourth array\&.  The arrays may then be directly
given to \fBcompadd\fP to register the matches with the completion code\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBcompfiles\fP
Used by the \fB_path_files\fP function to optimize complex recursive
filename generation (globbing)\&.  It does three things\&.  With the
\fB\-p\fP and \fB\-P\fP options it builds the glob patterns to use,
including the paths already handled and trying to optimize the
patterns with respect to the prefix and suffix from the line and the
match specification currently used\&.  The \fB\-i\fP option does the
directory tests for the \fBignore\-parents\fP style and the \fB\-r\fP option 
tests if a component for some of the matches are equal to the string
on the line and removes all other matches if that is true\&.
.TP
\fBcompgroups\fP
Used by the \fB_tags\fP function to implement the internals of the
\fBgroup\-order\fP style\&.  This only takes its arguments as names of
completion groups and creates the groups for it (all six types: sorted 
and unsorted, both without removing duplicates, with removing all
duplicates and with removing consecutive duplicates)\&.
.TP
\fBcompquote\fP [ \fB\-p\fP ] \fInames\fP \&.\&.\&.
There may be reasons to write completion functions that have to add
the matches using the \fB\-Q\fP option to \fBcompadd\fP and perform quoting
themselves\&.  Instead of interpreting the first character of the
\fBall_quotes\fP key of the \fBcompstate\fP special association and using
the \fBq\fP flag for parameter expansions, one can use this builtin
command\&.  The arguments are the names of scalar or array parameters
and the values of these parameters are quoted as needed for the
innermost quoting level\&.  If the \fB\-p\fP option is given, quoting is
done as if there is some prefix before the values of the parameters,
so that a leading equal sign will not be quoted\&.

.PP
The return status is non\-zero in case of an error and zero otherwise\&.

The subcommand \fBaddwin\fP creates a window with \fInlines\fP lines and
\fIncols\fP columns\&.  Its upper left corner will be placed at row
\fIbegin_y\fP and column
\fIbegin_x\fP of the screen\&.  \fItargetwin\fP is a string and refers
to the name of a window that is not currently assigned\&.  Note
in particular the curses convention that vertical values appear
before horizontal values\&.
.PP
If \fBaddwin\fP is given an existing window as the final argument, the new
window is created as a subwindow of \fIparentwin\fP\&.  This differs from an
ordinary new window in that the memory of the window contents is shared
with the parent\&'s memory\&.  Subwindows must be deleted before their parent\&.
Note that the coordinates of subwindows are relative to the screen, not
the parent, as with other windows\&.
.PP
Use the subcommand \fBdelwin\fP to delete a window created with
\fBaddwin\fP\&.  Note that \fBend\fP does \fInot\fP implicitly delete windows,
and that \fBdelwin\fP does not erase the screen image of the window\&.
.PP
The window corresponding to the full visible screen is called
\fBstdscr\fP; it always exists after `\fBzcurses init\fP\&' and cannot
be delete with \fBdelwin\fP\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBrefresh\fP will refresh window \fItargetwin\fP; this is
necessary to make any pending changes (such as characters you have
prepared for output with \fBchar\fP) visible on the screen\&.  \fBrefresh\fP
without an argument causes the screen to be cleared and redrawn\&.
If multiple windows are given, the screen is updated once at the end\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBtouch\fP marks the \fItargetwin\fPs listed as changed\&.
This is necessary before \fBrefresh\fPing windows if a window that
was in front of another window (which may be \fBstdscr\fP) is deleted\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBmove\fP moves the cursor position in \fItargetwin\fP to
new coordinates \fInew_y\fP and \fInew_x\fP\&.  Note that the 
subcommand \fBstring\fP (but not the subcommand \fBchar\fP) advances the
cursor position over the characters added\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBclear\fP erases the contents of \fItargetwin\fP\&.  One
(and no more than one) of three options may be specified\&.  With the
option \fBredraw\fP, in addition the next \fBrefresh\fP of \fItargetwin\fP
will cause the screen to be cleared and repainted\&.  With the option
\fBeol\fP, \fItargetwin\fP is only cleared to the end of the current cursor
line\&.  With the option
\fBbot\fP, \fItargetwin\fP is cleared to the end of the window, i\&.e
everything to the right and below the cursor is cleared\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBposition\fP writes various positions associated with
\fItargetwin\fP into the array named \fIarray\fP\&.
These are, in order:
.PD 0
.TP
\-
The y and x coordinates of the cursor relative to the top left
of \fItargetwin\fP
.TP
\-
The y and x coordinates of the top left of \fItargetwin\fP on the
screen
.TP
\-
The size of \fItargetwin\fP in y and x dimensions\&.
.PD
.PP
Outputting characters and strings are achieved by \fBchar\fP and \fBstring\fP
respectively\&.
.PP
To draw a border around window \fItargetwin\fP, use \fBborder\fP\&.  Note
that the border is not subsequently handled specially:  in other words,
the border is simply a set of characters output at the edge of the
window\&.  Hence it can be overwritten, can scroll off the window, etc\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBattr\fP will set \fItargetwin\fP\&'s attributes or
foreground/background color pair for any successive character output\&.
Each \fIattribute\fP given on the line may be prepended by a \fB+\fP to set
or a \fB\-\fP to unset that attribute; \fB+\fP is assumed if absent\&.  The
attributes supported are \fBblink\fP, \fBbold\fP, \fBdim\fP, \fBreverse\fP,
\fBstandout\fP, and \fBunderline\fP\&.
.PP
Each \fIfg_col\fP\fB/\fP\fIbg_col\fP attribute (to be read as
`\fIfg_col\fP on \fIbg_col\fP\&') sets the foreground and background color
for character output\&.  The color \fBdefault\fP is sometimes available
(in particular if the library is ncurses), specifying the foreground
or background color with which the terminal started\&.  The color pair
\fBdefault/default\fP is always available\&. To use more than the 8 named
colors (red, green, etc\&.) construct the \fIfg_col\fP\fB/\fP\fIbg_col\fP
pairs where \fIfg_col\fP and \fIbg_col\fP are decimal integers, e\&.g
\fB128/200\fP\&.  The maximum color value is 254 if the terminal supports
256 colors\&.
.PP
\fBbg\fP overrides the color and other attributes of all characters in the
window\&.  Its usual use is to set the background initially, but it will
overwrite the attributes of any characters at the time when it is called\&.
In addition to the arguments allowed with \fBattr\fP, an argument \fB@\fP\fIchar\fP
specifies a character to be shown in otherwise blank areas of the window\&.
Owing to limitations of curses this cannot be a multibyte character
(use of ASCII characters only is recommended)\&.  As the specified set
of attributes override the existing background, turning attributes
off in the arguments is not useful, though this does not cause an error\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBscroll\fP can be used with \fBon\fP or \fBoff\fP to enabled
or disable scrolling of a window when the cursor would otherwise move
below the window due to typing or output\&.  It can also be used with a
positive or negative integer to scroll the window up or down the given
number of lines without changing the current cursor position (which
therefore appears to move in the opposite direction relative to the
window)\&.  In the second case, if scrolling is \fBoff\fP it is temporarily
turned \fBon\fP to allow the window to be scrolled\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBinput\fP reads a single character from the window
without echoing it back\&.  If \fIparam\fP is supplied the character is
assigned to the parameter \fIparam\fP, else it is assigned to the
parameter \fBREPLY\fP\&.
.PP
If both \fIparam\fP and \fIkparam\fP are supplied, the key is read in
`keypad\&' mode\&.  In this mode special keys such as function keys and
arrow keys return the name of the key in the parameter \fIkparam\fP\&.  The
key names are the macros defined in the \fBcurses\&.h\fP or \fBncurses\&.h\fP
with the prefix `\fBKEY_\fP\&' removed; see also the description of the
parameter \fBzcurses_keycodes\fP below\&.  Other keys cause a value to be
set in \fIparam\fP as before\&.  On a successful return only one of
\fIparam\fP or \fIkparam\fP contains a non\-empty string; the other is set
to an empty string\&.
.PP
If \fImparam\fP is also supplied, \fBinput\fP attempts to handle mouse
input\&.  This is only available with the ncurses library; mouse handling
can be detected by checking for the exit status of `\fBzcurses mouse\fP\&' with
no arguments\&.  If a mouse
button is clicked (or double\- or triple\-clicked, or pressed or released with
a configurable delay from being clicked) then \fBkparam\fP is set to the string
\fBMOUSE\fP, and \fImparam\fP is set to an array consisting of the
following elements:
.PD 0
.TP
\-
An identifier to discriminate different input devices; this
is only rarely useful\&.
.TP
\-
The x, y and z coordinates of the mouse click relative to
the full screen, as three elements in that order (i\&.e\&. the y coordinate
is, unusually, after the x coordinate)\&.  The z coordinate is only
available for a few unusual input devices and is otherwise set to zero\&.
.TP
\-
Any events that occurred as separate items; usually
there will be just one\&.  An event consists of \fBPRESSED\fP, \fBRELEASED\fP,
\fBCLICKED\fP, \fBDOUBLE_CLICKED\fP or \fBTRIPLE_CLICKED\fP followed
immediately (in the same element) by the number of the button\&.
.TP
\-
If the shift key was pressed, the string \fBSHIFT\fP\&.
.TP
\-
If the control key was pressed, the string \fBCTRL\fP\&.
.TP
\-
If the alt key was pressed, the string \fBALT\fP\&.
.PD
.PP
Not all mouse events may be passed through to the terminal window;
most terminal emulators handle some mouse events themselves\&.  Note
that the ncurses manual implies that using input both with and
without mouse handling may cause the mouse cursor to appear and
disappear\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBmouse\fP can be used to configure the use of the mouse\&.
There is no window argument; mouse options are global\&.
`\fBzcurses mouse\fP\&' with no arguments returns status 0 if mouse handling
is possible, else status 1\&.  Otherwise, the possible arguments (which
may be combined on the same command line) are as follows\&.
\fBdelay\fP \fInum\fP sets the maximum delay in milliseconds between press and
release events to be considered as a click; the value 0 disables click
resolution, and the default is one sixth of a second\&.  \fBmotion\fP proceeded
by an optional `\fB+\fP\&' (the default) or \fB\-\fP turns on or off
reporting of mouse motion in addition to clicks, presses and releases,
which are always reported\&.  However, it appears reports for mouse
motion are not currently implemented\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBtimeout\fP specifies a timeout value for input from
\fItargetwin\fP\&.  If \fIintval\fP is negative, `\fBzcurses input\fP\&' waits
indefinitely for a character to be typed; this is the default\&.  If
\fIintval\fP is zero, `\fBzcurses input\fP\&' returns immediately; if there
is typeahead it is returned, else no input is done and status 1 is
returned\&.  If \fIintval\fP is positive, `\fBzcurses input\fP\&' waits
\fIintval\fP milliseconds for input and if there is none at the end of
that period returns status 1\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBquerychar\fP queries the character at the current cursor
position\&.  The return values are stored in the array named \fIparam\fP if
supplied, else in the array \fBreply\fP\&.  The first value is the character
(which may be a multibyte character if the system supports them); the
second is the color pair in the usual \fIfg_col\fP\fB/\fP\fIbg_col\fP
notation, or \fB0\fP if color is not supported\&.  Any attributes other than
color that apply to the character, as set with the subcommand \fBattr\fP,
appear as additional elements\&.
.PP
The subcommand \fBresize\fP resizes \fBstdscr\fP and all windows to given
dimensions (windows that stick out from the new dimensions are resized
down)\&. The underlying curses extension (\fBresize_term call\fP) can be
unavailable\&. To verify, zeroes can be used for \fIheight\fP and
\fIwidth\fP\&. If the result of the subcommand is \fB0\fP, resize_term is
available (\fB2\fP otherwise)\&. Tests show that resizing can be normally
accomplished by calling \fBzcurses end\fP and \fBzcurses refresh\fP\&. The
\fBresize\fP subcommand is provided for versatility\&. Multiple system
configurations have been checked and \fBzcurses end\fP and \fBzcurses
refresh\fP are still needed for correct terminal state after resize\&. To
invoke them with \fBresize\fP, use \fIendwin\fP argument\&.  Using
\fInosave\fP argument will cause new terminal state to not be saved
internally by \fBzcurses\fP\&. This is also provided for versatility and
should normally be not needed\&.

which case the file in question is written (whether or not it originally
existed); or an element may be unset, which will delete the file in
question\&.  For example, `\fBvared mapfile[myfile]\fP\&' works as expected,
editing the file `\fBmyfile\fP\&'\&.
.RS

When the array is accessed as a whole, the keys are the names of files in

memory)\&.  Thus \fB${(k)mapfile}\fP has the same effect as the glob operator
\fB*(D)\fP, since files beginning with a dot are not special\&.  Care must be
taken with expressions such as \fBrm ${(k)mapfile}\fP, which will delete

the whole contents of the file will always reside physically in memory when

operations)\&.  In particular, this means handling of sufficiently long files
(greater than the machine\&'s swap space, or than the range of the pointer
type) will be incorrect\&.

No errors are printed or flagged for non\-existent, unreadable, or

.SH "THE ZSH/NEARCOLOR MODULE"
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/mod_nearcolor.yo

The \fBzsh/nearcolor\fP module replaces colours specified as hex triplets
with the nearest colour in the 88 or 256 colour palettes that are widely
used by terminal emulators\&.  By default, 24\-bit true colour escape codes
are generated when colours are specified using hex triplets\&.  These are
not supported by all terminals\&.  The purpose of this module is to make
it easier to define colour preferences in a form that can work across a
range of terminal emulators\&.
.PP
Aside from the default colour, the ANSI standard for terminal escape
codes provides for eight colours\&. The bright attribute brings this to
sixteen\&. These basic colours are commonly used in terminal applications
due to being widely supported\&. Expanded 88 and 256 colour palettes are
also common and, while the first sixteen colours vary somewhat between
terminals and configurations, these add a generally consistent and
predictable set of colours\&.
.PP
In order to use the \fBzsh/nearcolor\fP module, it only needs to be
loaded\&. Thereafter, whenever a colour is specified using a hex triplet,
it will be compared against each of the available colours and the
closest will be selected\&. The first sixteen colours are never matched in
this process due to being unpredictable\&.
.PP
It isn\&'t possible to reliably detect support for true colour in the
terminal emulator\&. It is therefore recommended to be selective in
loading the \fBzsh/nearcolor\fP module\&. For example, the following

.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB[[ $COLORTERM = *(24bit|truecolor)* ]] || zmodload zsh/nearcolor\fP

the shell was in an emulation mode (i\&.e\&. had been invoked as some other
shell than zsh)\&.

If none of the start\-up files were found, the module then looks for the
file \fBnewuser\fP first in a sitewide directory, usually the parent
directory of the \fBsite\-functions\fP directory, and if that is not found the

\fBfunctions\fP directory containing version\-specific functions\&.  (These
directories can be configured when zsh is built using the
\fB\-\-enable\-site\-scriptdir=\fP\fIdir\fP and \fB\-\-enable\-scriptdir=\fP\fIdir\fP
flags to \fBconfigure\fP, respectively; the defaults are
\fIprefix\fP\fB/share/zsh\fP and \fIprefix\fP\fB/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION\fP where
the default \fIprefix\fP is \fB/usr/local\fP\&.)

Upon successful match,
if the expression captures substrings within parentheses,
\fBpcre_match\fP will set the array \fBmatch\fP to those

\fBMATCH\fP will be set to the entire matched portion of the
string, unless the \fB\-v\fP option is given, in which case the variable
\fIvar\fP will be set\&.
No variables are altered if there is no successful match\&.
A \fB\-n\fP option starts searching for a match from the
byte \fIoffset\fP position in \fIstring\fP\&.  If the \fB\-b\fP option is given,
the variable \fBZPCRE_OP\fP will be set to an offset pair string,
representing the byte offset positions of the entire matched portion
within the \fIstring\fP\&.  For example, a \fBZPCRE_OP\fP set to "32 45" indicates
that the matched portion began on byte offset 32 and ended on byte offset 44\&.
Here, byte offset position 45 is the position directly after the matched
portion\&.  Keep in mind that the byte position isn\&'t necessarily the same
as the character position when UTF\-8 characters are involved\&.
Consequently, the byte offset positions are only to be relied on in the
context of using them for subsequent searches on \fIstring\fP, using an offset
position as an argument to the \fB\-n\fP option\&.  This is mostly
used to implement the "find all non\-overlapping matches" functionality\&.

.SH "THE ZSH/PARAM/PRIVATE MODULE"

The \fBzsh/param/private\fP module is used to create parameters whose scope
is limited to the current function body, and \fInot\fP to other functions
called by the current function\&.
.PP
This module provides a single autoloaded builtin:

The \fBprivate\fP builtin accepts all the same options and arguments as \fBlocal\fP
(\fIzshbuiltins\fP(1)) except
for the `\fB\-\fP\fBT\fP\&' option\&.  Tied parameters may not be made private\&.
.RS
.PP
If used at the top level (outside a function scope), \fBprivate\fP creates a
normal parameter in the same manner as \fBdeclare\fP or \fBtypeset\fP\&.  A
warning about this is printed if \fBWARN_CREATE_GLOBAL\fP is set
(\fIzshoptions\fP(1))\&.  Used inside a
function scope, \fBprivate\fP creates a local parameter similar to one
declared with \fBlocal\fP, except having special properties noted below\&.
.PP
Special parameters which expose or manipulate internal shell state, such
as \fBARGC\fP, \fBargv\fP, \fBCOLUMNS\fP, \fBLINES\fP, \fBUID\fP, \fBEUID\fP, \fBIFS\fP,
\fBPROMPT\fP, \fBRANDOM\fP, \fBSECONDS\fP, etc\&., cannot be made private unless
the `\fB\-\fP\fBh\fP\&' option is used to hide the special meaning of the
parameter\&.  This may change in the future\&.
.RE
.PP
As with other \fBtypeset\fP equivalents, \fBprivate\fP is both a builtin and a
reserved word, so arrays may be assigned with parenthesized word list
\fIname\fP\fB=(\fP\fIvalue\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP syntax\&.  However, the reserved
word `\fBprivate\fP\&' is not available until \fBzsh/param/private\fP is loaded,
so care must be taken with order of execution and parsing for function
definitions which use \fBprivate\fP\&.  To compensate for this, the module
also adds the option `\fB\-P\fP\&' to the `\fBlocal\fP' builtin to declare private
parameters\&.
.PP
For example, this construction fails if \fBzsh/param/private\fP has not yet
been loaded when `\fBbad_declaration\fP\&' is defined:
.RS
.nf
\fBbad_declaration() {
  zmodload zsh/param/private
  private array=( one two three )

This construction works because \fBlocal\fP is already a keyword, and the
module is loaded before the statement is executed:

Parameters declared with \fBprivate\fP have the following properties:

.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
Within the function body where it is declared, the parameter
behaves as a local, except as noted above for tied or special parameters\&.
.TP
\(bu
The type of a parameter declared private cannot be changed in the
scope where it was declared, even if the parameter is unset\&.  Thus an
array cannot be assigned to a private scalar, etc\&.
.TP
\(bu
Within any other function called by the declaring function, the
private parameter does \fINOT\fP hide other parameters of the same name, so
for example a global parameter of the same name is visible and may be
assigned or unset\&.  This includes calls to anonymous functions, although
that may also change in the future\&.
.TP
\(bu
An exported private remains in the environment of inner scopes but
appears unset for the current shell in those scopes\&.  Generally, exporting
private parameters should be avoided\&.
.PP
Note that this differs from the static scope defined by compiled languages
derived from C, in that the a new call to the same function creates a new
scope, i\&.e\&., the parameter is still associated with the call stack rather
than with the function definition\&.  It differs from ksh `\fBtypeset \-S\fP\&'
because the syntax used to define the function has no bearing on whether
the parameter scope is respected\&.

\fBzsystem flock \-u\fP \fIfd_expr\fP
The builtin \fBzsystem\fP\&'s subcommand \fBflock\fP performs advisory file
locking (via the \fIfcntl\fP(2) system call) over the entire contents
of the given file\&.  This form of locking requires the processes
accessing the file to cooperate; its most obvious use is between two
instances of the shell itself\&.
.RS
.PP
In the first form the named \fIfile\fP, which must already exist, is
locked by opening a file descriptor to the file and applying a lock to
the file descriptor\&.  The lock terminates when the shell process that
created the lock exits; it is therefore often convenient to create file
locks within subshells, since the lock is automatically released when
the subshell exits\&.  Note that use of the \fBprint\fP builtin with the
\fB\-u\fP option will, as a side effect, release the lock, as will redirection
to the file in the shell holding the lock\&.  To work around this use a
subshell, e\&.g\&. `\fB(print message) >> \fP\fIfile\fP\&'\&.  Status 0 is
returned if the lock succeeds, else status 1\&.
.PP
In the second form the file descriptor given by the arithmetic
expression \fIfd_expr\fP is closed, releasing a lock\&.  The file descriptor
can be queried by using the `\fB\-f\fP \fIvar\fP\&' form during the lock;
on a successful lock, the shell variable \fIvar\fP is set to the file
descriptor used for locking\&.  The lock will be released if the
file descriptor is closed by any other means, for example using
`\fBexec {\fP\fIvar\fP\fB}>&\-\fP\&'; however, the form described here performs
a safety check that the file descriptor is in use for file locking\&.
.PP
By default the shell waits indefinitely for the lock to succeed\&.
The option \fB\-t\fP \fItimeout\fP specifies a timeout for the lock in
seconds; currently this must be an integer\&.  The shell will attempt
to lock the file once a second during this period\&.  If the attempt
times out, status 2 is returned\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-e\fP is given, the file descriptor for the lock is
preserved when the shell uses \fBexec\fP to start a new process;
otherwise it is closed at that point and the lock released\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-r\fP is given, the lock is only for reading, otherwise
it is for reading and writing\&.  The file descriptor is opened
accordingly\&.

Deleting sessions while a \fBzftp\fP command is active in the background can

as much output as is immediately available is copied\&.  The return status is
zero if any output is copied\&.
.RS

When also given a \fIparam\fP argument, at most one line is read and stored
in the parameter named \fIparam\fP\&.  Less than a full line may be read if
the pseudo\-terminal is non\-blocking\&.  The return status is zero if at least
one character is stored in \fIparam\fP\&.

If a \fIpattern\fP is given as well, output is read until the whole string
read matches the \fIpattern\fP, even in the non\-blocking case\&.  The return
status is zero if the string read matches the pattern, or if the command
has exited but at least one character could still be read\&.  If the option
\fB\-m\fP is present, the return status is zero only if the pattern matches\&.
As of this writing, a maximum of one megabyte of output can be consumed
this way; if a full megabyte is read without matching the pattern, the
return status is non\-zero\&.

In all cases, the return status is non\-zero if nothing could be read, and

\fBzselect\fP [ \fB\-rwe\fP ] [ \fB\-t\fP \fItimeout\fP ] [ \fB\-a\fP \fIarray\fP ] [ \fB\-A\fP \fIassoc\fP ] [ \fIfd\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
The \fBzselect\fP builtin is a front\-end to the `select\&' system call, which
blocks until a file descriptor is ready for reading or writing, or has an
error condition, with an optional timeout\&.  If this is not available on
your system, the command prints an error message and returns status 2
(normal errors return status 1)\&.  For more information, see your systems
documentation for \fIselect\fP(3)\&.  Note there is no connection with the
shell builtin of the same name\&.
.RS
.PP
Arguments and options may be intermingled in any order\&.  Non\-option
arguments are file descriptors, which must be decimal integers\&.  By
default, file descriptors are to be tested for reading, i\&.e\&. \fBzselect\fP
will return when data is available to be read from the file descriptor, or
more precisely, when a read operation from the file descriptor will not
block\&.  After a \fB\-r\fP, \fB\-w\fP and \fB\-e\fP, the given file descriptors are
to be tested for reading, writing, or error conditions\&.  These options and
an arbitrary list of file descriptors may be given in any order\&.
.PP
(The presence of an `error condition\&' is not well defined in the
documentation for many implementations of the select system call\&.
According to recent versions of the POSIX specification, it is really an
\fIexception\fP condition, of which the only standard example is out\-of\-band
data received on a socket\&.  So zsh users are unlikely to find the \fB\-e\fP
option useful\&.)
.PP
The option `\fB\-t\fP \fItimeout\fP\&' specifies a timeout in hundredths of a
second\&.  This may be zero, in which case the file descriptors will simply
be polled and \fBzselect\fP will return immediately\&.  It is possible to call
zselect with no file descriptors and a non\-zero timeout for use as a
finer\-grained replacement for `sleep\&'; note, however, the return status is
always 1 for a timeout\&.
.PP
The option `\fB\-a\fP \fIarray\fP\&' indicates that \fIarray\fP should be set to
indicate the file descriptor(s) which are ready\&.  If the option
is not
given, the array \fBreply\fP will be used for this purpose\&.  The array will
contain a string similar to the arguments for \fBzselect\fP\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzselect \-t 0 \-r 0 \-w 1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
might return immediately with status 0 and \fB$reply\fP containing `\fB\-r 0 \-w
1\fP\&' to show that both file descriptors are ready for the requested
operations\&.
.PP
The option `\fB\-A\fP \fIassoc\fP\&' indicates that the associative array
\fIassoc\fP should be set to indicate the file descriptor(s)
which are ready\&.  This option overrides the option \fB\-a\fP, nor will
\fBreply\fP be modified\&.  The keys of \fBassoc\fP are the file descriptors, and
the corresponding values are any of the characters `\fBrwe\fP\&' to indicate
the condition\&.
.PP
The command returns status 0 if some file descriptors are ready for
reading\&.  If the operation timed out, or a timeout of 0 was given and no
file descriptors were ready, or there was an error, it returns status 1 and
the array will not be set (nor modified in any way)\&.  If there was an error
in the select operation the appropriate error message is printed\&.

A pattern is considered to be more specific

simple strings are considered to be more specific than patterns and
complex patterns are considered to be more specific than the pattern
`\fB*\fP\&'\&.  A `\fB*\fP' in the pattern will match zero or more characters

\fBzformat \-a\fP \fIarray\fP \fIsep\fP \fIspec\fP \&.\&.\&.
This builtin provides two different forms of formatting\&. The first form 
is selected with the \fB\-f\fP option\&. In this case the \fIformat\fP
string will be modified by replacing sequences starting with a percent 
sign in it with strings from the \fIspec\fPs\&.  Each \fIspec\fP should be
of the form `\fIchar\fP\fB:\fP\fIstring\fP\&' which will cause every
appearance of the sequence `\fB%\fP\fIchar\fP\&' in \fIformat\fP to be replaced 
by the \fIstring\fP\&.  The `\fB%\fP\&' sequence may also contain optional
minimum and maximum field width specifications between the `\fB%\fP\&' and 
the `\fIchar\fP\&' in the form `\fB%\fP\fImin\fP\fB\&.\fP\fImax\fP\fBc\fP',
i\&.e\&. the minimum field width is given first and if the maximum field
width is used, it has to be preceded by a dot\&.  Specifying a minimum field
width makes the result be padded with spaces to the right if the
\fIstring\fP is shorter than the requested width\&.  Padding to the left
can be achieved by giving a negative minimum field width\&.  If a maximum 
field width is specified, the \fIstring\fP will be truncated after that
many characters\&.  After all `\fB%\fP\&' sequences for the given \fIspec\fPs
have been processed, the resulting string is stored in the parameter
\fIparam\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fB%\fP\-escapes also understand ternary expressions in the form used by
prompts\&.  The \fB%\fP is followed by a `\fB(\fP\&' and then an ordinary
format specifier character as described above\&.  There may be a set of
digits either before or after the `\fB(\fP\&'; these specify a test
number, which defaults to zero\&.  Negative numbers are also allowed\&.  An
arbitrary delimiter character follows the format specifier, which is
followed by a piece of `true\&' text, the delimiter character again, a piece
of `false\&' text, and a closing parenthesis\&.  The complete expression
(without the digits) thus looks like
`\fB%(\fP\fIX\fP\fB\&.\fP\fItext1\fP\fB\&.\fP\fItext2\fP\fB)\fP\&', except that
the `\fB\&.\fP\&' character is arbitrary\&.  The value given for the format
specifier in the \fIchar\fP\fB:\fP\fIstring\fP expressions is evaluated as a
mathematical expression, and compared with the test number\&.  If they are
the same, \fItext1\fP is output, else \fItext2\fP is output\&.  A parenthesis
may be escaped in \fItext2\fP as \fB%)\fP\&.  Either of \fItext1\fP or
\fItext2\fP may contain nested \fB%\fP\-escapes\&.

For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzformat \-f REPLY "The answer is \&'%3(c\&.yes\&.no)'\&." c:3\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs "The answer is \&'yes'\&." to \fBREPLY\fP since the value for the format
specifier \fBc\fP is 3, agreeing with the digit argument to the ternary
expression\&.
.PP
The second form, using the \fB\-a\fP option, can be used for aligning
strings\&.  Here, the \fIspec\fPs are of the form
`\fIleft\fP\fB:\fP\fIright\fP\&' where `\fIleft\fP' and `\fIright\fP' are
arbitrary strings\&.  These strings are modified by replacing the colons
by the \fIsep\fP string and padding the \fIleft\fP strings with spaces 
to the right so that the \fIsep\fP strings in the result (and hence the 
\fIright\fP strings after them) are all aligned if the strings are
printed below each other\&.  All strings without a colon are left
unchanged and all strings with an empty \fIright\fP string have the
trailing colon removed\&.  In both cases the lengths of the strings
are not used to determine how the other strings are to be aligned\&.
A colon in the \fIleft\fP string can be escaped with a backslash\&.
The resulting strings are stored in the \fIarray\fP\&.

described by \fIopt\fP is found in the positional parameters it is copied
into the \fIarray\fP specified with the \fB\-a\fP option; if the optional

This changes the assignment rules to implement a map among equivalent

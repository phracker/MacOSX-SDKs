.SH DESCRIPTION
.I zipnote
writes the comments in a zipfile to stdout.  This is the default mode.  A second mode
allows updating the comments in a zipfile as well as allows changing the names
of the files in the zipfile.  These modes are described below.

.SH EXAMPLES
To write all comments in a zipfile to stdout use for example
.LP
.nf
     zipnote foo.zip > foo.tmp
.fi
.LP
This writes all comments in the zipfile
.I foo.zip
to the file
.I foo.tmp
in a specific format.

.LP
If desired, this file can then be edited to change the comments and then used
to update the zipfile.
.LP
.nf
     zipnote -w foo.zip < foo.tmp
.fi
.LP
The names of the files in the zipfile can also be changed in this way.  This is done by
following lines like
.nf
     "@ name"
.fi
in the created temporary file (called
.I foo.tmp
here) with lines like
.nf
     "@=newname"
.fi
and then using the -w option as above.

.SH BUGS
The temporary file format is rather specific and zipnote is rather picky about it.
It should be easier to change file names in a script.

Does not yet support large (> 2 GB) or split archives.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I zip
is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS,
OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh, Amiga, and Acorn
RISC OS.  It is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands
.IR tar (1)
and
.IR compress (1)
and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems).
.LP
A companion program
.RI ( unzip (1L))
unpacks
.I zip
archives.
The
.I zip
and
.IR unzip (1L)
programs can work with archives produced by PKZIP (supporting
most PKZIP features up to PKZIP version 4.6),
and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work with archives produced by
\fIzip\fP (with some exceptions, notably streamed archives,
but recent changes in the zip file standard may facilitate
better compatibility).
.I zip
version 3.0 is compatible with PKZIP 2.04 and also supports
the Zip64 extensions of PKZIP 4.5 which allow archives
as well as files to exceed the previous 2 GB limit (4 GB in
some cases).  \fIzip\fP also now supports \fBbzip2\fP compression
if the \fBbzip2\fP library is included when \fIzip\fP is compiled.
Note that PKUNZIP 1.10 cannot extract files produced by
PKZIP 2.04 or
\fIzip\ 3.0\fP. You must use PKUNZIP 2.04g or
\fIunzip\ 5.0p1\fP (or later versions) to extract them.
.PP
See the \fBEXAMPLES\fP section at the bottom of this page
for examples of some typical uses of \fIzip\fP.
.PP
\fBLarge\ Archives\ and\ Zip64.\fP
.I zip
automatically uses the Zip64 extensions when files larger than 4 GB are
added to an archive, an archive containing Zip64 entries is updated
(if the resulting archive still needs Zip64),
the size of the archive will exceed 4 GB, or when the
number of entries in the archive will exceed about 64K.
Zip64 is also used for archives streamed from standard input as the size
of such archives are not known in advance, but the option \fB\-fz\-\fP can
be used to force \fIzip\fP to create PKZIP 2 compatible archives (as long
as Zip64 extensions are not needed).  You must use a PKZIP 4.5
compatible unzip, such as \fIunzip\ 6.0\fP or later, to extract files
using the Zip64 extensions.
.PP
In addition, streamed archives, entries encrypted with standard encryption,
or split archives created with the pause option may not be compatible with
PKZIP as data descriptors are used
and PKZIP at the time of this writing does not support data descriptors
(but recent changes in the PKWare published zip standard now include some
support for the data descriptor format \fIzip\fP uses).

.PP
\fBMac OS X.\fP  Though previous Mac versions had their own \fIzip\fP port,
\fIzip\fP supports Mac OS X as part of the Unix port and most Unix features
apply.  References to "MacOS" below generally refer to MacOS versions older
than OS X.  Support for some Mac OS features in the Unix Mac OS X port, such
as resource forks, is expected in the next \fIzip\fP release.

.PP
For a brief help on \fIzip\fP and \fIunzip\fP,
run each without specifying any parameters on the command line.

.SH "USE"
.PP
The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution;
for archiving files;
and for saving disk space by temporarily
compressing unused files or directories.
.LP
The
.I zip
program puts one or more compressed files into a single
.I zip
archive,
along with information about the files
(name, path, date, time of last modification, protection,
and check information to verify file integrity).
An entire directory structure can be packed into a
.I zip
archive with a single command.
Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files.
.I zip
has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files without
compression.  (If \fBbzip2\fP support is added, \fIzip\fP can also
compress using \fBbzip2\fP compression, but such entries require a
reasonably modern unzip to decompress.  When \fBbzip2\fP compression
is selected, it replaces deflation as the default method.)
.I zip
automatically chooses the better of the two (deflation or store or, if
\fBbzip2\fP is selected, \fBbzip2\fP or store) for each file to be
compressed.
.LP
\fBCommand\ format.\fP  The basic command format is
.IP
\fBzip\fR options archive inpath inpath ...
.LP
where \fBarchive\fR is a new or existing \fIzip\fR archive
and \fBinpath\fR is a directory or file path optionally including wildcards.
When given the name of an existing
.I zip
archive,
.I zip
will replace identically named entries in the
.I zip
archive (matching the relative names as stored in
the archive) or add entries for new names.
For example,
if
.I foo.zip
exists and contains
.I foo/file1
and
.IR foo/file2 ,
and the directory
.I foo
contains the files
.I foo/file1
and
.IR foo/file3 ,
then:
.IP
\fCzip -r foo.zip foo\fP
.LP
or more concisely
.IP
\fCzip -r foo foo\fP
.LP
will replace
.I foo/file1
in
.I foo.zip
and add
.I foo/file3
to
.IR foo.zip .
After this,
.I foo.zip
contains
.IR foo/file1 ,
.IR foo/file2 ,
and
.IR foo/file3 ,
with
.I foo/file2
unchanged from before.
.LP
So if before the zip command is executed \fIfoo.zip\fP has:
.IP
\fC foo/file1 foo/file2
.LP
and directory foo has:
.IP
\fC file1 file3\fP
.LP
then \fIfoo.zip\fP will have:
.IP
\fC foo/file1 foo/file2 foo/file3\fP
.LP
where \fIfoo/file1\fP is replaced and
\fIfoo/file3\fP is new.
.LP
\fB\-@\ file\ lists.\fP  If a file list is specified as
\fB\-@\fP
[Not on MacOS],
.I zip
takes the list of input files from standard input instead of from
the command line.  For example,
.IP
\fCzip -@ foo\fP
.LP
will store the files listed one per line on stdin in \fIfoo.zip\fP.
.LP
Under Unix,
this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction with the
\fIfind\fP\ (1)
command.
For example,
to archive all the C source files in the current directory and
its subdirectories:
.IP
\fCfind . -name "*.[ch]" -print | zip source -@\fP
.LP
(note that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding it).
.LP
\fBStreaming\ input\ and\ output.\fP
.I zip
will also accept a single dash ("-") as the zip file name, in which case it
will write the zip file to standard output, allowing the output to be piped
to another program. For example:
.IP
\fCzip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\fP
.LP
would write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified block size
for the purpose of backing up the current directory.
.LP
.I zip
also accepts a single dash ("-") as the name of a file to be compressed, in
which case it will read the file from standard input, allowing zip to take
input from another program. For example:
.IP
\fCtar cf - . | zip backup -\fP
.LP
would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing up
the current directory. This generally produces better compression than
the previous example using the -r option because
.I zip
can take advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored
using the command
.IP
\fCunzip -p backup | tar xf -\fP
.LP
When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal,
.I zip
acts as a filter, compressing standard input to standard output.
For example,
.IP
\fCtar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\fP
.LP
is equivalent to
.IP
\fCtar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\fP
.LP
.I zip
archives created in this manner can be extracted with the program
.I funzip
which is provided in the
.I unzip
package, or by
.I gunzip
which is provided in the
.I gzip
package (but some
.I gunzip
may not support this if
.I zip
used the Zip64 extensions). For example:
.IP
\fPdd if=/dev/nrst0  ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -\fC
.LP
The stream can also be saved to a file and
.I unzip
used.
.LP
If Zip64 support for large files and archives is enabled and
\fIzip\fR is used as a filter, \fIzip\fR creates a Zip64 archive
that requires a PKZIP 4.5 or later compatible unzip to read it.  This is
to avoid amgibuities in the zip file structure as defined in the current
zip standard (PKWARE AppNote) where the decision to use Zip64 needs to
be made before data is written for the entry, but for a stream the size
of the data is not known at that point.  If the data is known to be smaller
than 4 GB, the option \fB\-fz\-\fP can be used to prevent use of Zip64,
but \fIzip\fP will exit with an error if Zip64 was in fact needed.
\fIzip\ 3\fR and \fIunzip\ 6\fR and later can read archives with Zip64
entries.  Also, \fIzip\fP removes the Zip64 extensions if not needed
when archive entries are copied (see the \fB\-U\fP (\fB\-\-copy\fP)
option).
.LP
When directing the output to another file, note that all options should be
before the redirection including \fB-x\fP.  For example:
.IP
\fPzip archive "*.h" "*.c" -x donotinclude.h orthis.h > tofile\fC
.LP
\fBZip\ files.\fP  When changing an existing
.I zip
archive,
.I zip
will write a temporary file with the new contents,
and only replace the old one when the process of creating the new version
has been completed without error.
.LP
If the name of the
.I zip
archive does not contain an extension, the extension
\fB.zip\fP
is added. If the name already contains an extension other than
\fB.zip\fP,
the existing extension is kept unchanged.  However, split archives
(archives split over multiple files) require the \fB.zip\fP extension
on the last split.
.PP
\fBScanning\ and\ reading\ files.\fP
When \fIzip\fP starts, it scans for files to process (if needed).  If
this scan takes longer than about 5 seconds, \fIzip\fP will display
a "Scanning files" message and start displaying progress dots every 2 seconds
or every so many entries processed, whichever takes longer.  If there is more
than 2 seconds between dots it could indicate that finding each file is taking
time and could mean a slow network connection for example.
(Actually the initial file scan is
a two-step process where the directory scan is followed by a sort and these
two steps are separated with a space in the dots.  If updating an existing
archive, a space also appears between the existing file scan and the new
file scan.)  The scanning files dots are not controlled by the \fB\-ds\fP
dot size option, but the dots are turned off by the \fB\-q\fP quiet option.  The
\fB\-sf\fP show files option can be used to scan for files and get the list of
files scanned without actually processing them.
.LP
If \fIzip\fR is not able to read a file, it
issues a warning but
continues.  See the \fB\-MM\fP option below for more on how \fIzip\fP handles
patterns that are not matched and files that are not readable.
If some files were skipped, a
warning is issued at the end of the zip operation noting how many files
were read and how many skipped.
.PP
\fBCommand\ modes.\fP  \fIzip\fP now supports two distinct types of command
modes, \fBexternal\fP and \fBinternal\fP.  The \fBexternal\fP modes
(add, update, and freshen) read files from the file system (as well as from an
existing archive) while the \fBinternal\fP modes (delete and copy) operate
exclusively on entries in an existing archive.
.LP
.TP
.BI add\ \ \ \ \ \ 
Update existing entries and add new files.  If the archive does not exist
create it.  This is the default mode.
.TP
.BI update\ \fP(\fB\-u\fP)
Update existing entries if newer on the file system and add new files.  If
the archive does not exist issue warning then create a new archive.
.TP
.BI freshen\ \fP(\fB\-f\fP)
Update existing entries of an archive if newer on the file system.
Does not add new files to the archive.
.TP
.BI delete\ \fP(\fB\-d\fP)
Select entries in an existing archive and delete them.
.TP
.BI copy\ \fP(\fB\-U\fP)
Select entries in an existing archive and copy them to a new archive.
This new mode is similar to \fBupdate\fP but command line patterns
select entries in the existing archive rather than files from
the file system and it uses the \fB\-\-out\fP option to write the
resulting archive to a new file rather than update the existing
archive, leaving the original archive unchanged.
.LP
The new File Sync option (\fB\-FS\fP) is also considered a new mode,
though it is similar to \fBupdate\fP.  This mode synchronizes the
archive with the files on the OS, only replacing files in the
archive if the file time or size of the OS file is different, adding
new files, and deleting entries from the archive where there is
no matching file.  As this mode can delete entries from the archive,
consider making a backup copy of the archive.

Also see \fB\-DF\fP for creating difference archives.

See each option description below for details and the \fBEXAMPLES\fP section
below for examples.
.PP
\fBSplit\ archives.\fP  \fIzip\fP version 3.0 and later can create split
archives.  A
\fBsplit archive\fP is a standard zip archive split over multiple
files.  (Note that split archives are not just archives split in to
pieces, as the offsets of entries are now based on the start of each
split.  Concatenating the pieces together will invalidate these offsets,
but \fIunzip\fP can usually deal with it.  \fIzip\fP will usually refuse
to process such a spliced archive unless the \fB\-FF\fP fix option is
used to fix the offsets.)
.LP
One use of split archives is storing a large archive on multiple
removable media.
For a split archive with 20 split files the files are typically named (replace
ARCHIVE with the name of your archive) ARCHIVE.z01, ARCHIVE.z02, ..., ARCHIVE.z19,
ARCHIVE.zip.  Note that the last file is the \fB.zip\fP file.  In contrast,
\fBspanned archives\fP are the original multi-disk archive generally requiring
floppy disks and using volume labels to store disk numbers.  \fIzip\fP supports
split archives but not spanned archives, though a procedure exists for converting
split archives of the right size to spanned archives.  The reverse is also true,
where each file of a spanned archive can be copied in order to files with the
above names to create a split archive.
.LP
Use \fB\-s\fP to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is
given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB)
(the default is m).  The \fB\-sp\fP option can be used to pause \fIzip\fP between
splits to allow changing removable media, for example, but read the descriptions
and warnings for both \fB\-s\fP and \fB\-sp\fP below.
.LP
Though \fIzip\fP does not update split archives, \fIzip\fP provides the new
option \fB\-O\fP (\fB\-\-output\-file\fP or \fB\-\-out\fP) to allow split archives
to be updated and saved in a new archive.  For example,
.IP
\fCzip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c \-\-out outarchive.zip\fP
.LP
reads archive \fBinarchive.zip\fP, even if split, adds the files \fBfoo.c\fP and
\fBbar.c\fP, and writes the resulting archive to \fBoutarchive.zip\fP.  If
\fBinarchive.zip\fP is split then \fBoutarchive.zip\fP defaults to the same
split size.  Be aware that if \fBoutarchive.zip\fP and any split files that are
created with it already exist, these are always overwritten as needed without
warning.  This may be changed in the future.
.PP
\fBUnicode.\fP  Though the zip standard requires storing paths in an archive using
a specific character set, in practice zips have stored paths in archives in whatever
the local character set is.  This creates problems when an archive is created or
updated on a system using one character set and then extracted on another system
using a different character set.  When compiled with Unicode support enabled on
platforms that support wide characters, \fIzip\fP now stores, in addition to the
standard local path for backward compatibility, the UTF-8 translation of the path.
This provides a common universal character set for storing paths that allows these
paths to be fully extracted on other systems that support Unicode and to match as
close as possible on systems that don't.

On Win32 systems where paths are internally stored as Unicode but represented in
the local character set, it's possible that some paths will be skipped during a
local character set directory scan.  \fIzip\fP with Unicode support now can read
and store these paths.  Note that Win 9x systems and FAT file systems don't fully
support Unicode.

Be aware that console windows on Win32 and Unix, for example, sometimes don't
accurately show all characters due to how each operating system switches in
character sets for display.  However, directory navigation tools should show the
correct paths if the needed fonts are loaded.
.PP
\fBCommand line format.\fP  This version of
.I zip
has updated command line processing and support for long options.
.PP
Short options take the form
.IP
\fC-s[-][s[-]...][value][=value][\ value]\fP
.LP
where s is a one or two character short option.  A short option
that takes a value is last in an argument and anything after it is
taken as the value.  If the option can be negated and "-" immediately
follows the option, the option is negated.
Short options can also be given as separate arguments
.IP
\fC-s[-][value][=value][\ value]\ -s[-][value][=value][\ value]\ ...\fP
.LP
Short options in general take values either as part of the same
argument or as the following argument.  An optional = is also supported.
So
.IP
\fC-ttmmddyyyy\fP
.LP
and
.IP
\fC-tt=mmddyyyy\fP
.LP
and
.IP
\fC-tt mmddyyyy\fP
.LP
all work.  The \fB\-x\fP and \fB\-i\fP options accept lists of values
and use a slightly different format described below.  See the
\fB\-x\fP and \fB\-i\fP options.
.PP
Long options take the form
.IP
\fC--longoption[-][=value][ value]\fP
.LP
where the option starts with --, has a multicharacter name, can
include a trailing dash to negate the option (if the option
supports it), and can have a value (option argument) specified by
preceeding it with = (no spaces).  Values can also follow the
argument.  So
.IP
\fC--before-date=mmddyyyy\fP
.LP
and
.IP
\fC--before-date mmddyyyy\fP
.LP
both work.

Long option names can be shortened to the shortest unique
abbreviation.  See the option descriptions below for which
support long options.  To avoid confusion, avoid abbreviating
a negatable option with an embedded dash ("-") at the dash
if you plan to negate it (the parser would consider
a trailing dash, such as for the option \fB\-\-some\-option\fP using
\fB\-\-some\-\fP as the option, as part of the name rather
than a negating dash).  This may be changed to force the last
dash in \fB\-\-some\-\fP to be negating in the future.

ways to create incremental backups are using \fB\-t\fP to use file dates,

Not escaping the asterisks on a system where the shell expands

Under MSDOS,
.B \-d

This requires that file names be entered in upper case if they were
zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS system.  (We considered making this
case insensitive on systems where paths were case insensitive,
but it is possible the archive came from a system where case does
matter and the archive could include both \fBBar\fP and \fBbar\fP
as separate files in the archive.)  But see the new option \fB\-ic\fP

For example, if the existing archive was created using
.RS

from the \fIbar\fP directory, then the command
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -r foofull . -DF --out foonew

also from the \fIbar\fP directory creates the archive \fIfoonew\fP
with just the files not in \fIfoofull\fP and the files where
the size or file time of the files do not match those in \fIfoofull\fP.

Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for this option to work correctly.  A
change in timezone since the original archive was created could
result in no times matching and all files being included.

this will not add files that are not already in the

For example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -f foo\fP
.RE
.IP
This command should be run from the same directory from which the original
.I zip
command was run, since paths stored in
.I zip

.IP
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for the
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-u\fP and \fB\-o\fP

.IP
The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to do with the differences
between the Unix-format file times (always in GMT) and most of the other
operating systems (always local time) and the necessity to compare the two.
A typical TZ value is ``MET-1MEST'' (Middle European time with automatic
adjustment for ``summertime'' or Daylight Savings Time).
.IP
The format is TTThhDDD, where TTT is the time zone such as MET, hh is the
difference between GMT and local time such as -1 above, and DDD is
the time zone when daylight savings time is in effect.  Leave off
the DDD if there is no daylight savings time.  For the US Eastern

Fix the

are missing, but requires a reasonably intact central directory.
The input archive is scanned as usual, but \fIzip\fP will ignore
some problems.  The resulting archive should be valid, but any
inconsistent entries will be left out.
.IP
When doubled as in
\fB\-FF\fP,
the archive is scanned from the beginning and \fIzip\fP scans for special
signatures to identify the limits between the archive members. The
single
.B \-F
is more reliable if the archive is not too much damaged, so try this
option first.
.IP
If the archive is too damaged or the end has been truncated, you
must use \fB\-FF\fP.  This is a change from \fIzip\ 2.32\fP, where
the \fB\-F\fP option is able to read a truncated archive.  The
\fB\-F\fP option now more reliably fixes archives with minor
damage and the \fB\-FF\fP option is needed to fix archives where
\fB\-F\fP might have been sufficient before.
.IP
Neither option will recover archives that have been incorrectly
transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After the repair, the
.B \-t
option of
.I unzip
may show that some files have a bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered;
you can remove them from the archive using the
.B \-d
option of
\fIzip\fP.
.IP
Note that \fB\-FF\fP may have trouble fixing archives that include an
embedded zip archive that was stored (without compression) in the archive
and, depending on the damage, it may find the entries in the embedded
archive rather than the archive itself.  Try \fB\-F\fP first as it
does not have this problem.
.IP
The format of the fix commands have changed.  For example, to fix
the damaged archive \fIfoo.zip\fP,
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -F foo --out foofix
.RE
.IP
tries to read the entries normally, copying good entries to the
new archive \fIfoofix.zip\fP.  If this doesn't work, as when the
archive is truncated, or if some entries you know are in the archive
are missed, then try
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -FF foo --out foofixfix
.RE
.IP
and compare the resulting archive to the archive created by \fB\-F\fP.  The
\fB\-FF\fP option may create an inconsistent archive.  Depending on
what is damaged, you can then use the \fB\-F\fP option to fix that archive.
.IP
A split archive with missing split files can be fixed using
\fB\-F\fP if you have the last split of the archive (the \fB\.zip\fP file).
If this file is missing, you must use \fB\-FF\fP to fix the archive,
which will prompt you for the splits you have.

.B \-\-filesync
Synchronize the contents of an archive with the files on the OS.
Normally when an archive is updated, new files are added and changed
files are updated but files that no longer exist on the OS are not
deleted from the archive.  This option enables a new mode that checks
entries in the archive against the file system.  If the file time and
file size of the entry matches that of the OS file, the entry is
copied from the old archive instead of being read from the file system
and compressed.  If the OS file has changed, the entry is read and
compressed as usual.  If the entry in the archive does not match a
file on the OS, the entry is deleted.  Enabling this option should
create archives that are the same as new archives, but since existing
entries are copied instead of compressed, updating an existing archive
with \fB\-FS\fP can be much faster than creating a new archive.  Also
consider using \fB\-u\fP for updating an archive.
.IP
For this option to work, the archive should be updated from the same
directory it was created in so the relative paths match.  If few files
are being copied from the old archive, it may be faster to create a
new archive instead.
.IP
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for this option to work correctly.  A
change in timezone since the original archive was created could
result in no times matching and recompression of all files.
.IP
This option deletes files from the archive.  If you need to preserve
the original archive, make a copy of the archive first or use the
\fB\-\-out\fP option to output the updated archive to a new file.
Even though it may be slower, creating a new archive with a new archive
name is safer, avoids mismatches between archive and OS paths, and
is preferred.

terminator \fB@\fR (an argument that is just @).  So
the above can be given as
.RS

the option and the first file of a list.  For just

.IP

.RS
.IP
\fCzip --include=\\*.c -r foo .\fP

.IP
as additional examples.  The single value forms are
not recommended because they can be confusing and,
in particular, the \fB\-ifile\fP format can cause
problems if the first letter of \fBfile\fP combines with
\fBi\fP to form a two-letter option starting with

Whenever possible, use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter passwords.

Enable creating a split archive and set the split size.  A split archive is an archive
that could be split over many files.  As the archive is created, if the size of the
archive reaches the specified split size, that split is closed and the next split
opened.  In general all splits but the last will be the split size and the last
will be whatever is left.  If the entire archive is smaller than the split size a
single-file archive is created.

Split archives are stored in numbered files.  For example, if the output
archive is named \fBarchive\fP and three splits are required, the resulting
archive will be in the three files \fBarchive.z01\fP, \fBarchive.z02\fP, and
\fBarchive.zip\fP.  Do not change the numbering of these files or the archive
will not be readable as these are used to determine the order the splits are read.

Split size is a number optionally followed by a multiplier.  Currently the
number must be an integer.  The multiplier can currently be one of
\fBk\fP (kilobytes), \fBm\fP (megabytes), \fBg\fP (gigabytes), or \fBt\fP
(terabytes).  As 64k is the minimum split size, numbers without multipliers
default to megabytes.  For example, to create a split archive called \fBfoo\fP
with the contents of the \fBbar\fP directory with splits of 670 MB that might
be useful for burning on CDs, the command:
.RS
.IP
zip -s 670m -r foo bar
.RE
.IP
could be used.

Currently the old splits of a split archive are not excluded from a new
archive, but they can be specifically excluded.  If possible, keep
the input and output archives out of the path being zipped when creating
split archives.

Using \fB\-s\fP without \fB\-sp\fP as above creates all the splits where
\fBfoo\fP is being written, in this case the current directory.  This split
mode updates the splits as the archive is being created, requiring all
splits to remain writable, but creates split archives that are readable by
any unzip that supports split archives.  See \fB\-sp\fP below for enabling
split pause mode which allows splits to be written directly to removable
media.

The option \fB\-sv\fP can be used to enable verbose splitting and provide details of
how the splitting is being done.  The \fB\-sb\fP option can be used to ring the bell
when \fIzip\fP pauses for the next split destination.

Split archives cannot be updated, but see the \fB\-O\fP (\fB\-\-out\fP) option for
how a split archive can be updated as it is copied to a new archive.
A split archive can also be converted into a single-file archive using a
split size of 0 or negating the \fB\-s\fP option:

split to allow changing split destination or media.

Though this split mode allows writing splits directly to removable media, it
uses stream archive format that may not be readable by some unzips.  Before
relying on splits created with \fB\-sp\fP, test a split archive with the unzip
you will be using.

selects the files to include in the new archive.  Unlike \fB\-u\fP
update, input patterns on the command line are matched against archive

.RS

Determine what \fIzip\fP should do with Unicode file names.
\fIzip\ 3.0\fP, in addition to the standard file path, now
includes the UTF\-8 translation of the path if the entry path
is not entirely 7-bit ASCII.  When an entry
is missing the Unicode path, \fIzip\fP reverts back to the
standard file path.  The problem with using the standard path
is this path is in the local character set of the zip that created
the entry, which may contain characters that are not valid in
the character set being used by the unzip.  When \fIzip\fP is
reading an archive, if an entry also has a Unicode path,
\fIzip\fP now defaults to using the Unicode path to recreate
the standard path using the current local character set.

This option can be used to determine what \fIzip\fP should do
with this path if there is a mismatch between the stored standard path
and the stored UTF-8 path (which can happen if the standard path was
updated).  In all cases, if there is a mismatch it is
assumed that the standard path is more current and
\fIzip\fP uses that.  Values for \fBv\fP are
.RS

.IP
w \- warn, continue with standard path
.IP
i \- ignore, continue with standard path
.IP
n \- no Unicode, do not use Unicode paths
.RE
.IP
The default is to warn and continue.

Characters that are not valid in the current character set are
escaped as \fB#Uxxxx\fP and \fB#Lxxxxxx\fP, where x is an
ASCII character for a hex digit.  The first is used if a 16-bit
character number is sufficient to represent the Unicode character
and the second if the character needs more than 16 bits to
represent it's Unicode character code.  Setting \fB\-UN\fP to
.RS

as in

.IP
\fCzip archive -sU -UN=e\fP

ASCII.

Normally \fIzip\fP stores UTF\-8 directly in the standard path field
on systems where UTF\-8 is the current character set and stores the
UTF\-8 in the new extra fields otherwise.  The option
.RS
.IP
u \- UTF\-8
.RE
.IP
as in
.RS
.IP
\fCzip archive dir -r -UN=UTF8\fP

storing UTF\-8 directly is the default on Unix systems that support it.
This option could be useful on Windows systems where the escaped
path is too large to be a valid path and the UTF\-8 version of the
path is smaller, but native UTF\-8 is not backward compatible on
Windows systems.

Set the default compression method.  Currently the main methods supported

can be set to:

\fBstore\fP \- Setting the compression method to \fBstore\fP forces
\fIzip\fP to store entries with no compression.  This is generally
faster than compressing entries, but results in no space savings.
This is the same as using \fB\-0\fP (compression level zero).

\fBdeflate\fP \- This is the default method for \fIzip\fP.  If \fIzip\fP
determines that storing is better than deflation, the entry will be
stored instead.

\fBbzip2\fP \- If \fBbzip2\fP support is compiled in, this compression
method also becomes available.  Only some modern unzips currently support
the \fBbzip2\fP compression method, so test the unzip you will be using
before relying on archives using this method (compression method 12).

Because of the way the shell on Unix does filename substitution,
files starting with "." are not included;
to include these as well:
.IP
\fCzip stuff .* *\fP
.LP
Even this will not include any subdirectories from the current directory.
.LP
To zip up an entire directory, the command:
.IP
\fCzip -r foo foo\fP
.LP
creates the archive
.IR foo.zip ,
containing all the files and directories in the directory
.I foo
that is contained within the current directory.
.LP
You may want to make a
.I zip
archive that contains the files in
.IR foo ,
without recording the directory name,
.IR foo .
You can use the
.B \-j
option to leave off the paths,
as in:
.IP
\fCzip -j foo foo/*\fP
.LP
If you are short on disk space,
you might not have enough room to hold both the original directory
and the corresponding compressed
.I zip
archive.
In this case, you can create the archive in steps using the
.B \-m
option.
If
.I foo
contains the subdirectories
.IR tom ,
.IR dick ,
and
.IR harry ,
you can:
.IP
\fCzip -rm foo foo/tom\fP
.br
\fCzip -rm foo foo/dick\fP
.br
\fCzip -rm foo foo/harry\fP
.LP
where the first command creates
.IR foo.zip ,
and the next two add to it.
At the completion of each
.I zip
command,
the last created archive is deleted,
making room for the next
.I zip
command to function.



.LP
Use \fB\-s\fP to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is given as
a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB).
The command
.IP
\fCzip -s 2g -r split.zip foo\fP
.LP
creates a split archive of the directory foo with splits no bigger than 2\ GB each.  If
foo contained 5\ GB of contents and the contents were stored in the split archive without
compression (to make this example simple), this would create three splits, split.z01 at 2\ GB,
split.z02 at 2\ GB, and split.zip at a little over 1\ GB.
.LP
The \fB\-sp\fP option can be used to pause \fIzip\fP between splits to allow changing
removable media, for example, but read the descriptions and warnings for both \fB\-s\fP
and \fB\-sp\fP below.
.LP
Though \fIzip\fP does not update split archives, \fIzip\fP provides the new option \fB\-O\fP
(\fB\-\-output\-file\fP) to allow split archives to be updated and saved in a new archive.  For example,
.IP
\fCzip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c \-\-out outarchive.zip\fP
.LP
reads archive \fBinarchive.zip\fP, even if split, adds the files \fBfoo.c\fP and
\fBbar.c\fP, and writes the resulting archive to \fBoutarchive.zip\fP.  If
\fBinarchive.zip\fP is split then \fBoutarchive.zip\fP defaults
to the same split size.  Be aware that \fBoutarchive.zip\fP and any split files
that are created with it are always overwritten without warning.  This may be changed
in the future.




.SH "PATTERN MATCHING"
This section applies only to Unix.
Watch this space for details on MSDOS and VMS operation.
However, the special wildcard characters \fB*\fR and \fB[]\fR below apply
to at least MSDOS also.
.LP
The Unix shells (\fIsh\fP, \fIcsh\fP, \fIbash\fP, and others) normally
do filename substitution (also called "globbing") on command arguments.
Generally the special characters are:
.TP
.B ?
match any single character
.TP
.B *
match any number of characters (including none)
.TP
.B []
match any character in the range indicated within the brackets
(example: [a\-f], [0\-9]).  This form of wildcard matching
allows a user to specify a list of characters between square brackets and
if any of the characters match the expression matches.  For example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip archive "*.[hc]"\fP
.RE
.IP
would archive all files in the current directory that end in
\fB.h\fP or \fB.c\fP.

Ranges of characters are supported:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip archive "[a\-f]*"\fP
.RE
.IP
would add to the archive all files starting with "a" through "f".

Negation is also supported, where any character in that position not in
the list matches.  Negation is supported by adding \fB!\fP or \fB^\fP
to the beginning of the list:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip archive "*.[!o]"\fP
.RE
.IP
matches files that don't end in ".o".

On WIN32, [] matching needs to be turned on with the -RE option to avoid
the confusion that names with [ or ] have caused.

.LP
When these characters are encountered
(without being escaped with a backslash or quotes),
the shell will look for files relative to the current path
that match the pattern,
and replace the argument with a list of the names that matched.
.LP
The
.I zip
program can do the same matching on names that are in the
.I zip
archive being modified or,
in the case of the
.B \-x
(exclude) or
.B \-i
(include) options, on the list of files to be operated on, by using
backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the name expansion.
In general, when
.I zip
encounters a name in the list of files to do, it first looks for the name in
the file system.  If it finds it, it then adds it to the list of files to do.
If it does not find it, it looks for the name in the
.I zip
archive being modified (if it exists), using the pattern matching characters
described above, if present.  For each match, it will add that name to the
list of files to be processed, unless this name matches one given
with the
.B \-x
option, or does not match any name given with the
.B \-i
option.
.LP
The pattern matching includes the path,
and so patterns like \\*.o match names that end in ".o",
no matter what the path prefix is.
Note that the backslash must precede every special character (i.e. ?*[]),
or the entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes ("").
.LP
In general, use backslashes or double quotes for paths
that have wildcards to make
.I zip
do the pattern matching for file paths, and always for
paths and strings that have spaces or wildcards for
\fB\-\i\fP, \fB\-x\fP, \fB\-R\fP, \fB\-d\fP, and \fB\-U\fP
and anywhere \fIzip\fP needs to process the wildcards.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.LP
The following environment variables are read and used by
.I zip
as described.
.TP
.B ZIPOPT\ \ 
contains default options that will be used when running
\fIzip\fR.  The contents of this environment variable will get
added to the command line just after the \fBzip\fR command.
.TP
.B ZIP\ \ \ \ \ 
[Not on RISC OS and VMS] see ZIPOPT
.TP
.B Zip$Options
[RISC OS] see ZIPOPT
.TP
.B Zip$Exts
[RISC OS] contains extensions separated by a : that will cause
native filenames with one of the specified extensions to
be added to the zip file with basename and extension swapped.
.TP
.B ZIP_OPTS
[VMS] see ZIPOPT
.SH "SEE ALSO"
compress(1),
shar(1L),
tar(1),
unzip(1L),
gzip(1L)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit status (or error level) approximates the exit codes defined by PKWARE
and takes on the following values, except under VMS:
.RS
.IP 0
normal; no errors or warnings detected.
.IP 2
unexpected end of zip file.
.IP 3
a generic error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing may have
completed successfully anyway; some broken zipfiles created by other
archivers have simple work-arounds.
.IP 4
\fIzip\fP was unable to allocate memory for one or more buffers during
program initialization.
.IP 5
a severe error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing probably
failed immediately.
.IP 6
entry too large to be processed (such as input files larger than 2 GB when
not using Zip64 or trying to read an existing archive that is too large) or
entry too large to be split with \fIzipsplit\fP
.IP 7
invalid comment format
.IP 8
\fIzip\fP -T failed or out of memory
.IP 9
the user aborted \fIzip\fP prematurely with control-C (or similar)
.IP 10
\fIzip\fP encountered an error while using a temp file
.IP 11
read or seek error
.IP 12
\fIzip\fP has nothing to do
.IP 13
missing or empty zip file
.IP 14
error writing to a file
.IP 15
\fIzip\fP was unable to create a file to write to
.IP 16
bad command line parameters
.IP 18
\fIzip\fP could not open a specified file to read
.IP 19
\fIzip\fP was compiled with options not supported on this system
.RE
.PP
VMS interprets standard Unix (or PC) return values as other, scarier-looking
things, so \fIzip\fP instead maps them into VMS-style status codes.  In
general, \fIzip\fP sets VMS Facility = 1955 (0x07A3), Code = 2* Unix_status,
and an appropriate Severity (as specified in ziperr.h).  More details are
included in the VMS-specific documentation.  See [.vms]NOTES.TXT and
[.vms]vms_msg_gen.c.
.PD
.SH BUGS
.I zip
3.0 is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use
.I zip
1.1 to produce
.I zip
files which can be extracted by PKUNZIP 1.10.
.PP
.I zip
files produced by
.I zip
3.0 must not be
.I updated
by
.I zip
1.1 or PKZIP 1.10, if they contain
encrypted members or if they have been produced in a pipe or on a non-seekable
device. The old versions of
.I zip
or PKZIP would create an archive with an incorrect format.
The old versions can list the contents of the zip file
but cannot extract it anyway (because of the new compression algorithm).
If you do not use encryption and use regular disk files, you do
not have to care about this problem.
.LP
Under VMS,
not all of the odd file formats are treated properly.
Only stream-LF format
.I zip
files are expected to work with
.IR zip .
Others can be converted using Rahul Dhesi's BILF program.
This version of
.I zip
handles some of the conversion internally.
When using Kermit to transfer zip files from VMS to MSDOS, type "set
file type block" on VMS.  When transfering from MSDOS to VMS, type
"set file type fixed" on VMS.  In both cases, type "set file type
binary" on MSDOS.
.LP
Under some older VMS versions, \fIzip\fP may hang for file
specifications that use DECnet syntax
.I foo::*.*.
.LP
On OS/2, zip cannot match some names, such as those including an
exclamation mark or a hash sign.  This is a bug in OS/2 itself: the
32-bit DosFindFirst/Next don't find such names.  Other programs such
as GNU tar are also affected by this bug.
.LP
Under OS/2, the amount of Extended Attributes displayed by DIR is (for
compatibility) the amount returned by the 16-bit version of
DosQueryPathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3 and 2.0 would report different
EA sizes when DIRing a file.
However, the structure layout returned by the 32-bit DosQueryPathInfo()
is a bit different, it uses extra padding bytes and link pointers (it's
a linked list) to have all fields on 4-byte boundaries for portability
to future RISC OS/2 versions. Therefore the value reported by
.I zip
(which uses this 32-bit-mode size) differs from that reported by DIR.
.I zip
stores the 32-bit format for portability, even the 16-bit
MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2 1.3, so even this one shows the
32-bit-mode size.

.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Thanks to R. P. Byrne for his
.I Shrink.Pas
program, which inspired this project,
and from which the shrink algorithm was stolen;
to Phil Katz for placing in the public domain the
.I zip
file format, compression format, and .ZIP filename extension, and for
accepting minor changes to the file format; to Steve Burg for
clarifications on the deflate format; to Haruhiko Okumura and Leonid
Broukhis for providing some useful ideas for the compression
algorithm; to Keith Petersen, Rich Wales, Hunter Goatley and Mark
Adler for providing a mailing list and
.I ftp
site for the Info-ZIP group to use; and most importantly, to the
Info-ZIP group itself (listed in the file
.IR infozip.who )
without whose tireless testing and bug-fixing efforts a portable
.I zip
would not have been possible.
Finally we should thank (blame) the first Info-ZIP moderator,
David Kirschbaum,
for getting us into this mess in the first place.
The manual page was rewritten for Unix by R. P. C. Rodgers and
updated by E. Gordon for \fIzip\fR 3.0.

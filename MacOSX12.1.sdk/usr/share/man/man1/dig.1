.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdig\fR
(domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers\&. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried\&. Most DNS administrators use
\fBdig\fR
to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output\&. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality than
\fBdig\fR\&.
.PP
Although
\fBdig\fR
is normally used with command\-line arguments, it also has a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file\&. A brief summary of its command\-line arguments and options is printed when the
\fB\-h\fR
option is given\&. Unlike earlier versions, the BIND 9 implementation of
\fBdig\fR
allows multiple lookups to be issued from the command line\&.
.PP
Unless it is told to query a specific name server,
\fBdig\fR
will try each of the servers listed in
/etc/resolv\&.conf\&. If no usable server addresses are found,
\fBdig\fR
will send the query to the local host\&.
.PP
When no command line arguments or options are given,
\fBdig\fR
will perform an NS query for "\&." (the root)\&.
.PP
It is possible to set per\-user defaults for
\fBdig\fR
via
${HOME}/\&.digrc\&. This file is read and any options in it are applied before the command line arguments\&.
.PP
The IN and CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top level domain names\&. Either use the
\fB\-t\fR
and
\fB\-c\fR
options to specify the type and class, use the
\fB\-q\fR
the specify the domain name, or use "IN\&." and "CH\&." when looking up these top level domains\&.
.SH "SIMPLE USAGE"
.PP
A typical invocation of
\fBdig\fR
looks like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
 dig @server name type 
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
where:
.PP
\fBserver\fR
.RS 4
is the name or IP address of the name server to query\&. This can be an IPv4 address in dotted\-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in colon\-delimited notation\&. When the supplied
\fIserver\fR
argument is a hostname,
\fBdig\fR
resolves that name before querying that name server\&.
.sp
If no
\fIserver\fR
argument is provided,
\fBdig\fR
consults
/etc/resolv\&.conf; if an address is found there, it queries the name server at that address\&. If either of the
\fB\-4\fR
or
\fB\-6\fR
options are in use, then only addresses for the corresponding transport will be tried\&. If no usable addresses are found,
\fBdig\fR
will send the query to the local host\&. The reply from the name server that responds is displayed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBname\fR
.RS 4
is the name of the resource record that is to be looked up\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBtype\fR
.RS 4
indicates what type of query is required \(em ANY, A, MX, SIG, etc\&.
\fItype\fR
can be any valid query type\&. If no
\fItype\fR
argument is supplied,
\fBdig\fR
will perform a lookup for an A record\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-4
.RS 4
Use IPv4 only\&.
.RE
.PP
\-6
.RS 4
Use IPv6 only\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b \fIaddress\fR\fI[#port]\fR
.RS 4
Set the source IP address of the query\&. The
\fIaddress\fR
must be a valid address on one of the host\*(Aqs network interfaces, or "0\&.0\&.0\&.0" or "::"\&. An optional port may be specified by appending "#<port>"
.RE
.PP
\-c \fIclass\fR
.RS 4
Set the query class\&. The default
\fIclass\fR
is IN; other classes are HS for Hesiod records or CH for Chaosnet records\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f \fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Batch mode:
\fBdig\fR
reads a list of lookup requests to process from the given
\fIfile\fR\&. Each line in the file should be organized in the same way they would be presented as queries to
\fBdig\fR
using the command\-line interface\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i
.RS 4
Do reverse IPv6 lookups using the obsolete RFC1886 IP6\&.INT domain, which is no longer in use\&. Obsolete bit string label queries (RFC2874) are not attempted\&.
.RE
.PP
\-k \fIkeyfile\fR
.RS 4
Sign queries using TSIG using a key read from the given file\&. Key files can be generated using
\fBtsig-keygen\fR(8)\&. When using TSIG authentication with
\fBdig\fR, the name server that is queried needs to know the key and algorithm that is being used\&. In BIND, this is done by providing appropriate
\fBkey\fR
and
\fBserver\fR
statements in
named\&.conf\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m
.RS 4
Enable memory usage debugging\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p \fIport\fR
.RS 4
Send the query to a non\-standard port on the server, instead of the defaut port 53\&. This option would be used to test a name server that has been configured to listen for queries on a non\-standard port number\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q \fIname\fR
.RS 4
The domain name to query\&. This is useful to distinguish the
\fIname\fR
from other arguments\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t \fItype\fR
.RS 4
The resource record type to query\&. It can be any valid query type which is supported in BIND 9\&. The default query type is "A", unless the
\fB\-x\fR
option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup\&. A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR\&. When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, set the
\fItype\fR
to
ixfr=N\&. The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone since the serial number in the zone\*(Aqs SOA record was
\fIN\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
Print the version number and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-x \fIaddr\fR
.RS 4
Simplified reverse lookups, for mapping addresses to names\&. The
\fIaddr\fR
is an IPv4 address in dotted\-decimal notation, or a colon\-delimited IPv6 address\&. When the
\fB\-x\fR
is used, there is no need to provide the
\fIname\fR,
\fIclass\fR
and
\fItype\fR
arguments\&.
\fBdig\fR
automatically performs a lookup for a name like
94\&.2\&.0\&.192\&.in\-addr\&.arpa
and sets the query type and class to PTR and IN respectively\&. IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6\&.ARPA domain (but see also the
\fB\-i\fR
option)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-y \fI[hmac:]\fR\fIkeyname:secret\fR
.RS 4
Sign queries using TSIG with the given authentication key\&.
\fIkeyname\fR
is the name of the key, and
\fIsecret\fR
is the base64 encoded shared secret\&.
\fIhmac\fR
is the name of the key algorithm; valid choices are
hmac\-md5,
hmac\-sha1,
hmac\-sha224,
hmac\-sha256,
hmac\-sha384, or
hmac\-sha512\&. If
\fIhmac\fR
is not specified, the default is
hmac\-md5
or if MD5 was disabled
hmac\-sha256\&.
.sp
NOTE: You should use the
\fB\-k\fR
option and avoid the
\fB\-y\fR
option, because with
\fB\-y\fR
the shared secret is supplied as a command line argument in clear text\&. This may be visible in the output from
\fBps\fR(1)
or in a history file maintained by the user\*(Aqs shell\&.
.RE
.SH "macOS NOTICE"
.PP
The
\fBdig\fR
command does not use the host name and address resolution or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by other processes running on macOS.
The results of name or address queries printed by
\fBdig\fR
may differ from those found by other processes that use the macOS native name and address resolution mechanisms.
The results of DNS queries may also differ from queries that use the macOS DNS routing library.
.SH "QUERY OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBdig\fR
provides a number of query options which affect the way in which lookups are made and the results displayed\&. Some of these set or reset flag bits in the query header, some determine which sections of the answer get printed, and others determine the timeout and retry strategies\&.
.PP
Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign (+)\&. Some keywords set or reset an option\&. These may be preceded by the string
no
to negate the meaning of that keyword\&. Other keywords assign values to options like the timeout interval\&. They have the form
\fB+keyword=value\fR\&. Keywords may be abbreviated, provided the abbreviation is unambiguous; for example,
+cd
is equivalent to
+cdflag\&. The query options are:
.PP
\fB+[no]aaflag\fR
.RS 4
A synonym for
\fI+[no]aaonly\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]aaonly\fR
.RS 4
Sets the "aa" flag in the query\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]additional\fR
.RS 4
Display [do not display] the additional section of a reply\&. The default is to display it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]adflag\fR
.RS 4
Set [do not set] the AD (authentic data) bit in the query\&. This requests the server to return whether all of the answer and authority sections have all been validated as secure according to the security policy of the server\&. AD=1 indicates that all records have been validated as secure and the answer is not from a OPT\-OUT range\&. AD=0 indicate that some part of the answer was insecure or not validated\&. This bit is set by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]all\fR
.RS 4
Set or clear all display flags\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]answer\fR
.RS 4
Display [do not display] the answer section of a reply\&. The default is to display it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]authority\fR
.RS 4
Display [do not display] the authority section of a reply\&. The default is to display it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]besteffort\fR
.RS 4
Attempt to display the contents of messages which are malformed\&. The default is to not display malformed answers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+bufsize=B\fR
.RS 4
Set the UDP message buffer size advertised using EDNS0 to
\fIB\fR
bytes\&. The maximum and minimum sizes of this buffer are 65535 and 0 respectively\&. Values outside this range are rounded up or down appropriately\&. Values other than zero will cause a EDNS query to be sent\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]cdflag\fR
.RS 4
Set [do not set] the CD (checking disabled) bit in the query\&. This requests the server to not perform DNSSEC validation of responses\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]class\fR
.RS 4
Display [do not display] the CLASS when printing the record\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]cmd\fR
.RS 4
Toggles the printing of the initial comment in the output identifying the version of
\fBdig\fR
and the query options that have been applied\&. This comment is printed by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]comments\fR
.RS 4
Toggle the display of comment lines in the output\&. The default is to print comments\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]cookie\fR\fB[=####]\fR
.RS 4
Send an COOKIE EDNS option, containing an optional
\fIvalue\fR\&. Replaying a COOKIE from a previous response will allow the server to identify a previous client\&. The default is
\fB+nocookie\fR\&.
.sp
\fB+cookie\fR
is automatically set when +trace is in use, to better emulate the default queries from a nameserver\&.
.sp
This option was formerly called
\fB+[no]sit\fR
(Server Identity Token)\&. In BIND 9\&.10\&.0 through BIND 9\&.10\&.2, it sent the experimental option code 65001\&. This was changed to option code 10 in BIND 9\&.10\&.3 when the DNS COOKIE option was allocated\&.
.sp
The
\fB+[no]sit\fR
is now deprecated, but has been retained as a synonym for
\fB+[no]cookie\fR
for backward compatibility within the BIND 9\&.10 branch\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]crypto\fR
.RS 4
Toggle the display of cryptographic fields in DNSSEC records\&. The contents of these field are unnecessary to debug most DNSSEC validation failures and removing them makes it easier to see the common failures\&. The default is to display the fields\&. When omitted they are replaced by the string "[omitted]" or in the DNSKEY case the key id is displayed as the replacement, e\&.g\&. "[ key id = value ]"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]defname\fR
.RS 4
Deprecated, treated as a synonym for
\fI+[no]search\fR
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]dnssec\fR
.RS 4
Requests DNSSEC records be sent by setting the DNSSEC OK bit (DO) in the OPT record in the additional section of the query\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+domain=somename\fR
.RS 4
Set the search list to contain the single domain
\fIsomename\fR, as if specified in a

directive in
/etc/resolv\&.conf, and enable search list processing as if the
\fI+search\fR
option were given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]edns[=#]\fR
.RS 4
Specify the EDNS version to query with\&. Valid values are 0 to 255\&. Setting the EDNS version will cause a EDNS query to be sent\&.
\fB+noedns\fR
clears the remembered EDNS version\&. EDNS is set to 0 by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]ednsflags[=#]\fR
.RS 4
Set the must\-be\-zero EDNS flags bits (Z bits) to the specified value\&. Decimal, hex and octal encodings are accepted\&. Setting a named flag (e\&.g\&. DO) will silently be ignored\&. By default, no Z bits are set\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]ednsnegotiation\fR
.RS 4
Enable / disable EDNS version negotiation\&. By default EDNS version negotiation is enabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]ednsopt[=code[:value]]\fR
.RS 4
Specify EDNS option with code point
\fBcode\fR
and optionally payload of
\fBvalue\fR
as a hexadecimal string\&.
\fBcode\fR
can be either an EDNS option name (for example,
NSID
or
ECS), or an arbitrary numeric value\&.
\fB+noednsopt\fR
clears the EDNS options to be sent\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+[no]expire\fR
.RS 4
Send an EDNS Expire option\&.
.RE

A global set of query options, which should be applied to all queries, can also be supplied\&. These global query options must precede the first tuple of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options supplied on the command line\&. Any global query options (except the
\fB+[no]cmd\fR
option) can be overridden by a query\-specific set of query options\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
dig +qr www\&.isc\&.org any \-x 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 isc\&.org ns +noqr
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
shows how
\fBdig\fR
could be used from the command line to make three lookups: an ANY query for
www\&.isc\&.org, a reverse lookup of 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 and a query for the NS records of
isc\&.org\&. A global query option of
\fI+qr\fR
is applied, so that
\fBdig\fR
shows the initial query it made for each lookup\&. The final query has a local query option of
\fI+noqr\fR
which means that
\fBdig\fR
will not print the initial query when it looks up the NS records for
isc\&.org\&.
.SH "IDN SUPPORT"
.PP
If
\fBdig\fR
has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name) support, it can accept and display non\-ASCII domain names\&.
\fBdig\fR
appropriately converts character encoding of domain name before sending a request to DNS server or displaying a reply from the server\&. If you\*(Aqd like to turn off the IDN support for some reason, defines the
\fBIDN_DISABLE\fR
environment variable\&. The IDN support is disabled if the variable is set when
\fBdig\fR
runs\&.

.TH iopattern 1m  "Jul 25, 2005" "version 0.70" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
iopattern \- print disk I/O pattern. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iopattern
[\-v] [\-d device] [\-f filename] [\-m mount_point] [interval [count]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This prints details on the I/O access pattern for the disks, such as
percentage of events that were of a random or sequential nature.
By default totals for all disks are printed.

An event is considered random when the heads seek. This program prints
the percentage of events that are random. The size of the seek is not
measured - it's either random or not.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

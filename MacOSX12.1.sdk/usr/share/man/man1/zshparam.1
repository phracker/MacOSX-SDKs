.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes\&.
A name may be any sequence of alphanumeric
characters and underscores, or the single characters
`\fB*\fP\&', `\fB@\fP', `\fB#\fP', `\fB?\fP', `\fB\-\fP', `\fB$\fP', or `\fB!\fP'\&.
A parameter whose name begins with an alphanumeric or underscore is also
referred to as a \fIvariable\fP\&.
.PP
The attributes of a parameter determine the \fItype\fP of its value, often
referred to as the parameter type or variable type, and also control
other processing that may be applied to the value when it is referenced\&.
The value type may be a \fIscalar\fP (a string, an integer, or a floating
point number), an array (indexed numerically), or an \fIassociative\fP
array (an unordered set of name\-value pairs, indexed by name, also
referred to as a \fIhash\fP)\&.
.PP
Named scalar parameters may have the \fIexported\fP, \fB\-x\fP, attribute, to
copy them into the process environment, which is then passed from the
shell to any new processes that it starts\&.  Exported parameters are called
\fIenvironment variables\fP\&. The shell also \fIimports\fP environment variables
at startup time and automatically marks the corresponding parameters as
exported\&.  Some environment variables are not imported for reasons of
security or because they would interfere with the correct operation of
other shell features\&.
.PP
Parameters may also be \fIspecial\fP, that is, they have a predetermined
meaning to the shell\&.  Special parameters cannot have their type changed
or their readonly attribute turned off, and if a special parameter is
unset, then later recreated, the special properties will be retained\&.
.PP
To declare the type of a parameter, or to assign a string or numeric value
to a scalar parameter, use the \fBtypeset\fP builtin\&.
.PP
The value of a scalar parameter may also be assigned by writing:

.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In scalar assignment, \fIvalue\fP is expanded as a single string, in
which the elements of arrays are joined together; filename expansion is
not performed unless the option \fBGLOB_ASSIGN\fP is set\&.
.PP
When the integer attribute, \fB\-i\fP, or a floating point attribute, \fB\-E\fP
or \fB\-F\fP, is set for \fIname\fP, the \fIvalue\fP is subject to arithmetic
evaluation\&.  Furthermore, by replacing `\fB=\fP\&' with `\fB+=\fP', a parameter
can be incremented or appended to\&.  See the section `Array Parameters\&' and
\fIArithmetic Evaluation\fP (in \fIzshmisc\fP(1))
for additional forms of assignment\&.
.PP
Note that assignment may implicitly change the attributes of a parameter\&.
For example, assigning a number to a variable in arithmetic evaluation may
change its type to integer or float, and with \fBGLOB_ASSIGN\fP assigning a
pattern to a variable may change its type to an array\&.
.PP
To reference the value of a parameter, write `\fB$\fP\fIname\fP\&' or
`\fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB}\fP\&'\&.  See
\fIParameter Expansion\fP in \fIzshexpn\fP(1)
for complete details\&.  That section also explains the effect
of the difference between scalar and array assignment on parameter
expansion\&.
.SH "ARRAY PARAMETERS"
To assign an array value, write one of:

.RS
.nf
\fBset \-A\fP \fIname\fP \fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.RE
.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB=(\fP\fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP
.fi
.RE
.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB=(\fP\fB[\fP\fIkey\fP\fB]=\fP\fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
If no parameter \fIname\fP exists, an ordinary array parameter is created\&.
If the parameter \fIname\fP exists and is a scalar, it is replaced by a new
array\&.
.PP
In the third form, \fIkey\fP is an expression that will be evaluated in
arithmetic context (in its simplest form, an integer) that gives the
index of the element to be assigned with \fIvalue\fP\&.  In this form any
elements not explicitly mentioned that come before the largest index to
which a value is assigned are assigned an empty string\&.  The indices
may be in any order\&.  Note that this syntax is strict: \fB[\fP and \fB]=\fP must
not be quoted, and \fIkey\fP may not consist of the unquoted string
\fB]=\fP, but is otherwise treated as a simple string\&.  The enhanced forms
of subscript expression that may be used when directly subscripting a
variable name, described in the section Array Subscripts below, are not
available\&.
.PP
The syntaxes with and without the explicit key may be mixed\&.  An implicit
\fIkey\fP is deduced by incrementing the index from the previously
assigned element\&.  Note that it is not treated as an error
if latter assignments in this form overwrite earlier assignments\&.
.PP
For example, assuming the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP is not set, the following:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBarray=(one [3]=three four)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
causes the array variable \fBarray\fP to contain four elements \fBone\fP,
an empty string, \fBthree\fP and \fBfour\fP, in that order\&.
.PP
In the forms where only \fIvalue\fP is specified, full command
line expansion is performed\&.
.PP
In the \fB[\fP\fIkey\fP\fB]=\fP\fIvalue\fP form,
both \fIkey\fP and \fIvalue\fP undergo all forms of expansion
allowed for single word shell expansions (this does not include filename
generation); these are as performed by the parameter expansion flag
\fB(e)\fP as described in
\fIzshexpn\fP(1)\&.
Nested parentheses may surround \fIvalue\fP and are included as part of the
value, which is joined into a plain string; this differs from ksh which
allows the values themselves to be arrays\&.  A future version of zsh may
support that\&.  To cause the brackets to be interpreted as a character
class for filename generation, and therefore to treat the resulting list
of files as a set of values, quote the equal sign using any form of quoting\&.
Example:

.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB=(\fP\fB[a\-z]\&'='*)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
To append to an array without changing the existing values, use
one of the following:

.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB+=(\fP\fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP
.fi
.RE
.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB+=(\fP\fB[\fP\fIkey\fP\fB]=\fP\fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In the second form \fIkey\fP may specify an existing index as well as an
index off the end of the old array; any existing value is overwritten by
\fIvalue\fP\&.  Also, it is possible to use \fB[\fP\fIkey\fP\fB]+=\fP\fIvalue\fP
to append to the existing value at that index\&.
.PP
Within the parentheses on the right hand side of either form of the
assignment, newlines and semicolons are treated the same as white space,
separating individual \fIvalue\fPs\&.  Any consecutive sequence of such
characters has the same effect\&.
.PP
Ordinary array parameters may also be explicitly declared with:

.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset \-a\fP \fIname\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Associative arrays \fImust\fP be declared before assignment, by using:

.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset \-A\fP \fIname\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
When \fIname\fP refers to an associative array, the list in an assignment
is interpreted as alternating keys and values:

.RS
.nf
\fBset \-A\fP \fIname\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.RE
.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB=(\fP\fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP
.fi
.RE
.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB=(\fP\fB[\fP\fIkey\fP\fB]=\fP\fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that only one of the two syntaxes above may be used in any
given assignment; the forms may not be mixed\&.  This is unlike the case
of numerically indexed arrays\&.
.PP
Every \fIkey\fP must have a \fIvalue\fP in this case\&.  Note that this
assigns to the entire array, deleting any elements that do not appear in
the list\&.  The append syntax may also be used with an associative array:

.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB+=(\fP\fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP
.fi
.RE
.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB+=(\fP\fB[\fP\fIkey\fP\fB]=\fP\fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This adds a new key/value pair if the key is not already present, and
replaces the value for the existing key if it is\&.  In the second
form it is also possible to use \fB[\fP\fIkey\fP\fB]+=\fP\fIvalue\fP to
append to the existing value at that key\&.  Expansion is performed
identically to the corresponding forms for normal arrays, as
described above\&.
.PP
To create an empty array (including associative arrays), use one of:

.RS
.nf
\fBset \-A\fP \fIname\fP
.fi
.RE
.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB=()\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.SS "Array Subscripts"
Individual elements of an array may be selected using a subscript\&.  A
subscript of the form `\fB[\fP\fIexp\fP\fB]\fP\&' selects the single element
\fIexp\fP, where \fIexp\fP is an arithmetic expression which will be subject
to arithmetic expansion as if it were surrounded by
`\fB$((\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB))\fP\&'\&.  The elements are numbered
beginning with 1, unless the \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP option is set in which case
they are numbered from zero\&.
.PP
Subscripts may be used inside braces used to delimit a parameter name, thus
`\fB${foo[2]}\fP\&' is equivalent to `\fB$foo[2]\fP'\&.  If the \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP
option is set, the braced form is the only one that works, as bracketed
expressions otherwise are not treated as subscripts\&.
.PP
If the \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP option is not set, then by default accesses to
an array element with a subscript that evaluates to zero return an
empty string, while an attempt to write such an element is treated as
an error\&.  For backward compatibility the \fBKSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT\fP
option can be set to cause subscript values 0 and 1 to be equivalent; see
the description of the option in \fIzshoptions\fP(1)\&.
.PP
The same subscripting syntax is used for associative arrays, except that
no arithmetic expansion is applied to \fIexp\fP\&.  However, the parsing
rules for arithmetic expressions still apply, which affects the way that
certain special characters must be protected from interpretation\&.  See
\fISubscript Parsing\fP below for details\&.
.PP
A subscript of the form `\fB[*]\fP\&' or `\fB[@]\fP' evaluates to all elements
of an array; there is no difference between the two except when they
appear within double quotes\&.
`\fB"$foo[*]"\fP\&' evaluates to `\fB"$foo[1] $foo[2] \fP\&.\&.\&.\fB"\fP', whereas
`\fB"$foo[@]"\fP\&' evaluates to `\fB"$foo[1]" "$foo[2]" \fP\&.\&.\&.'\&.  For
associative arrays, `\fB[*]\fP\&' or `\fB[@]\fP' evaluate to all the values,
in no particular order\&.  Note that this does not substitute
the keys; see the documentation for the `\fBk\fP\&' flag under
\fIParameter Expansion Flags\fP in \fIzshexpn\fP(1)
for complete details\&.
When an array parameter is referenced as `\fB$\fP\fIname\fP\&' (with no
subscript) it evaluates to `\fB$\fP\fIname\fP\fB[*]\fP\&', unless the \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP
option is set in which case it evaluates to `\fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB[0]}\fP\&' (for
an associative array, this means the value of the key `\fB0\fP\&', which may
not exist even if there are values for other keys)\&.
.PP
A subscript of the form `\fB[\fP\fIexp1\fP\fB,\fP\fIexp2\fP\fB]\fP\&'
selects all elements in the range \fIexp1\fP to \fIexp2\fP,
inclusive\&. (Associative arrays are unordered, and so do not support
ranges\&.) If one of the subscripts evaluates to a negative number,
say \fB\-\fP\fIn\fP, then the \fIn\fPth element from the end
of the array is used\&.  Thus `\fB$foo[\-3]\fP\&' is the third element
from the end of the array \fBfoo\fP, and
`\fB$foo[1,\-1]\fP\&' is the same as `\fB$foo[*]\fP'\&.
.PP
Subscripting may also be performed on non\-array values, in which
case the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted\&.
For example, if \fBFOO\fP is set to `\fBfoobar\fP\&', then
`\fBecho $FOO[2,5]\fP\&' prints `\fBooba\fP'\&.  Note that
some forms of subscripting described below perform pattern matching,
and in that case the substring extends from the start of the match
of the first subscript to the end of the match of the second
subscript\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBstring="abcdefghijklm"
print ${string[(r)d?,(r)h?]}\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
prints `\fBdefghi\fP\&'\&.  This is an obvious generalisation of the
rule for single\-character matches\&.  For a single subscript,
only a single character is referenced (not the range of characters
covered by the match)\&.
.PP
Note that in substring operations the second subscript is handled
differently by the \fBr\fP and \fBR\fP subscript flags: the former takes the
shortest match as the length and the latter the longest match\&.  Hence
in the former case a \fB*\fP at the end is redundant while in
the latter case it matches the whole remainder of the string\&.  This
does not affect the result of the single subscript case as here the
length of the match is irrelevant\&.
.PP
.SS "Array Element Assignment"
.PP
A subscript may be used on the left side of an assignment like so:

.RS
.nf
\fIname\fP\fB[\fP\fIexp\fP\fB]=\fP\fIvalue\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In this form of assignment the element or range specified by \fIexp\fP
is replaced by the expression on the right side\&.  An array (but not an
associative array) may be created by assignment to a range or element\&.
Arrays do not nest, so assigning a parenthesized list of values to an
element or range changes the number of elements in the array, shifting the
other elements to accommodate the new values\&.  (This is not supported for
associative arrays\&.)
.PP
This syntax also works as an argument to the \fBtypeset\fP command:

.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset\fP \fB"\fP\fIname\fP\fB[\fP\fIexp\fP\fB]"=\fP\fIvalue\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fIvalue\fP may \fInot\fP be a parenthesized list in this case; only
single\-element assignments may be made with \fBtypeset\fP\&.  Note that quotes
are necessary in this case to prevent the brackets from being interpreted
as filename generation operators\&.  The \fBnoglob\fP precommand modifier
could be used instead\&.
.PP
To delete an element of an ordinary array, assign `\fB()\fP\&' to
that element\&.  To delete an element of an associative array, use the
\fBunset\fP command:

.RS
.nf
\fBunset\fP \fB"\fP\fIname\fP\fB[\fP\fIexp\fP\fB]"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.SS "Subscript Flags"
If the opening bracket, or the comma in a range, in any subscript
expression is directly followed by an opening parenthesis, the string up
to the matching closing one is considered to be a list of flags, as in
`\fIname\fP\fB[(\fP\fIflags\fP\fB)\fP\fIexp\fP\fB]\fP\&'\&.
.PP
The flags \fBs\fP, \fBn\fP and \fBb\fP take an argument; the delimiter
is shown below as `\fB:\fP\&', but any character, or the matching pairs
`\fB(\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP\&', `\fB{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB}\fP', `\fB[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]\fP', or
`\fB<\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB>\fP\&', may be used, but note that `\fB<\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB>\fP' can only be
used if the subscript is inside a double quoted expression or a
parameter substitution enclosed in braces as otherwise the expression is
interpreted as a redirection\&.
.PP
The flags currently understood are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBw\fP
If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes
subscripting work on words instead of characters\&.  The default word
separator is whitespace\&.  When combined with the \fBi\fP or \fBI\fP flag,
the effect is to produce the index of the first character of the
first/last word which matches the given pattern; note that a failed
match in this case always yields 0\&.
.TP
\fBs:\fP\fIstring\fP\fB:\fP
This gives the \fIstring\fP that separates words (for use with the
\fBw\fP flag)\&.  The delimiter character \fB:\fP is arbitrary; see above\&.
.TP
\fBp\fP
Recognize the same escape sequences as the \fBprint\fP builtin in
the string argument of a subsequent `\fBs\fP\&' flag\&.
.TP
\fBf\fP
If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes
subscripting work on lines instead of characters, i\&.e\&. with elements
separated by newlines\&.  This is a shorthand for `\fBpws:\en:\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBr\fP
Reverse subscripting: if this flag is given, the \fIexp\fP is taken as a
pattern and the result is the first matching array element, substring or
word (if the parameter is an array, if it is a scalar, or if it is a
scalar and the `\fBw\fP\&' flag is given, respectively)\&.  The subscript used
is the number of the matching element, so that pairs of subscripts such as
`\fB$foo[(r)??,3]\fP\&' and `\fB$foo[(r)??,(r)f*]\fP' are
possible if the parameter is not an associative array\&.  If the
parameter is an associative array, only the value part of each pair is
compared to the pattern, and the result is that value\&.
.RS
.PP
If a search through an ordinary array failed, the search sets the
subscript to one past the end of the array, and hence
\fB${array[(r)\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB]}\fP will substitute the empty string\&.  Thus the
success of a search can be tested by using the \fB(i)\fP flag, for
example (assuming the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP is not in effect):
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB[[ ${array[(i)pattern]} \-le ${#array} ]]\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
If \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP is in effect, the \fB\-le\fP should be replaced by \fB\-lt\fP\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBR\fP
Like `\fBr\fP\&', but gives the last match\&.  For associative arrays, gives
all possible matches\&. May be used for assigning to ordinary array
elements, but not for assigning to associative arrays\&.  On failure, for
normal arrays this has the effect of returning the element corresponding to
subscript 0; this is empty unless one of the options \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP or
\fBKSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT\fP is in effect\&.
.RS
.PP
Note that in subscripts with both `\fBr\fP\&' and `\fBR\fP' pattern characters
are active even if they were substituted for a parameter (regardless of the
setting of \fBGLOB_SUBST\fP which controls this feature in normal pattern
matching)\&.  The flag `\fBe\fP\&' can be added to inhibit pattern matching\&.  As
this flag does not inhibit other forms of substitution, care is still
required; using a parameter to hold the key has the desired effect:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBkey2=\&'original key'
print ${array[(Re)$key2]}\fP
.fi
.RE
.RE
.TP
\fBi\fP
Like `\fBr\fP\&', but gives the index of the match instead; this may not be
combined with a second argument\&.  On the left side of an assignment,
behaves like `\fBr\fP\&'\&.  For associative arrays, the key part of each pair
is compared to the pattern, and the first matching key found is the
result\&.  On failure substitutes the length of the array plus one, as
discussed under the description of `\fBr\fP\&', or the empty string for an
associative array\&.
.TP
\fBI\fP
Like `\fBi\fP\&', but gives the index of the last match, or all possible
matching keys in an associative array\&.  On failure substitutes 0, or
the empty string for an associative array\&.  This flag is best when
testing for values or keys that do not exist\&.
.TP
\fBk\fP
If used in a subscript on an associative array, this flag causes the keys
to be interpreted as patterns, and returns the value for the first key
found where \fIexp\fP is matched by the key\&.  Note this could be any
such key as no ordering of associative arrays is defined\&.
This flag does not work on the left side of an assignment to an associative
array element\&.  If used on another type of parameter, this behaves like `\fBr\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBK\fP
On an associative array this is like `\fBk\fP\&' but returns all values where
\fIexp\fP is matched by the keys\&.  On other types of parameters this has
the same effect as `\fBR\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBn:\fP\fIexpr\fP\fB:\fP
If combined with `\fBr\fP\&', `\fBR\fP', `\fBi\fP' or `\fBI\fP', makes them give
the \fIn\fPth or \fIn\fPth last match (if \fIexpr\fP evaluates to
\fIn\fP)\&.  This flag is ignored when the array is associative\&.
The delimiter character \fB:\fP is arbitrary; see above\&.
.TP
\fBb:\fP\fIexpr\fP\fB:\fP
If combined with `\fBr\fP\&', `\fBR\fP', `\fBi\fP' or `\fBI\fP', makes them begin
at the \fIn\fPth or \fIn\fPth last element, word, or character (if \fIexpr\fP
evaluates to \fIn\fP)\&.  This flag is ignored when the array is associative\&.
The delimiter character \fB:\fP is arbitrary; see above\&.
.TP
\fBe\fP
This flag causes any pattern matching that would be performed on the
subscript to use plain string matching instead\&.  Hence
`\fB${array[(re)*]}\fP\&' matches only the array element whose value is \fB*\fP\&.
Note that other forms of substitution such as parameter substitution are
not inhibited\&.
.RS
.PP
This flag can also be used to force \fB*\fP or \fB@\fP to be interpreted as
a single key rather than as a reference to all values\&.  It may be used
for either purpose on the left side of an assignment\&.
.RE
.PP
See \fIParameter Expansion Flags\fP (\fIzshexpn\fP(1)) for additional ways to manipulate the results of array subscripting\&.
.PP
.SS "Subscript Parsing"
.PP
This discussion applies mainly to associative array key strings and to
patterns used for reverse subscripting (the `\fBr\fP\&', `\fBR\fP', `\fBi\fP',
etc\&. flags), but it may also affect parameter substitutions that appear
as part of an arithmetic expression in an ordinary subscript\&.
.PP
To avoid subscript parsing limitations in assignments to associative array
elements, use the append syntax:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBaa+=(\&'key with "*strange*" characters' 'value string')\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The basic rule to remember when writing a subscript expression is that all
text between the opening `\fB[\fP\&' and the closing `\fB]\fP' is interpreted
\fIas if\fP it were in double quotes (see \fIzshmisc\fP(1))\&.  However, unlike double quotes which normally cannot nest, subscript
expressions may appear inside double\-quoted strings or inside other
subscript expressions (or both!), so the rules have two important
differences\&.
.PP
The first difference is that brackets (`\fB[\fP\&' and `\fB]\fP') must appear as
balanced pairs in a subscript expression unless they are preceded by a
backslash (`\fB\e\fP\&')\&.  Therefore, within a subscript expression (and unlike
true double\-quoting) the sequence `\fB\e[\fP\&' becomes `\fB[\fP', and similarly
`\fB\e]\fP\&' becomes `\fB]\fP'\&.  This applies even in cases where a backslash is
not normally required; for example, the pattern `\fB[^[]\fP\&' (to match any
character other than an open bracket) should be written `\fB[^\e[]\fP\&' in a
reverse\-subscript pattern\&.  However, note that `\fB\e[^\e[\e]\fP\&' and even
`\fB\e[^[]\fP\&' mean the \fIsame\fP thing, because backslashes are always
stripped when they appear before brackets!
.PP
The same rule applies to parentheses (`\fB(\fP\&' and `\fB)\fP') and
braces (`\fB{\fP\&' and `\fB}\fP'): they must appear either in balanced pairs or
preceded by a backslash, and backslashes that protect parentheses or
braces are removed during parsing\&.  This is because parameter expansions
may be surrounded by balanced braces, and subscript flags are introduced by
balanced parentheses\&.
.PP
The second difference is that a double\-quote (`\fB"\fP\&') may appear as part
of a subscript expression without being preceded by a backslash, and
therefore that the two characters `\fB\e"\fP\&' remain as two characters in the
subscript (in true double\-quoting, `\fB\e"\fP\&' becomes `\fB"\fP')\&.  However,
because of the standard shell quoting rules, any double\-quotes that appear
must occur in balanced pairs unless preceded by a backslash\&.  This makes
it more difficult to write a subscript expression that contains an odd
number of double\-quote characters, but the reason for this difference is
so that when a subscript expression appears inside true double\-quotes, one
can still write `\fB\e"\fP\&' (rather than `\fB\e\e\e"\fP') for `\fB"\fP'\&.
.PP
To use an odd number of double quotes as a key in an assignment, use the
\fBtypeset\fP builtin and an enclosing pair of double quotes; to refer to
the value of that key, again use double quotes:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset \-A aa
typeset "aa[one\e"two\e"three\e"quotes]"=QQQ
print "$aa[one\e"two\e"three\e"quotes]"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
It is important to note that the quoting rules do not change when a
parameter expansion with a subscript is nested inside another subscript
expression\&.  That is, it is not necessary to use additional backslashes
within the inner subscript expression; they are removed only once, from
the innermost subscript outwards\&.  Parameters are also expanded from the
innermost subscript first, as each expansion is encountered left to right
in the outer expression\&.
.PP
A further complication arises from a way in which subscript parsing is
\fInot\fP different from double quote parsing\&.  As in true double\-quoting,
the sequences `\fB\e*\fP\&', and `\fB\e@\fP' remain as two characters when they
appear in a subscript expression\&.  To use a literal `\fB*\fP\&' or `\fB@\fP' as
an associative array key, the `\fBe\fP\&' flag must be used:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset \-A aa
aa[(e)*]=star
print $aa[(e)*]\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
A last detail must be considered when reverse subscripting is performed\&.
Parameters appearing in the subscript expression are first expanded and
then the complete expression is interpreted as a pattern\&.  This has two
effects: first, parameters behave as if \fBGLOB_SUBST\fP were on (and it
cannot be turned off); second, backslashes are interpreted twice, once
when parsing the array subscript and again when parsing the pattern\&.  In a
reverse subscript, it\&'s necessary to use \fIfour\fP backslashes to cause a
single backslash to match literally in the pattern\&.  For complex patterns,
it is often easiest to assign the desired pattern to a parameter and then
refer to that parameter in the subscript, because then the backslashes,
brackets, parentheses, etc\&., are seen only when the complete expression is
converted to a pattern\&.  To match the value of a parameter literally in a
reverse subscript, rather than as a pattern,
use `\fB${(q\fP\fB)\fP\fIname\fP\fB}\fP\&' (see \fIzshexpn\fP(1)) to quote the expanded value\&.
.PP
Note that the `\fBk\fP\&' and `\fBK\fP' flags are reverse subscripting for an
ordinary array, but are \fInot\fP reverse subscripting for an associative
array!  (For an associative array, the keys in the array itself are
interpreted as patterns by those flags; the subscript is a plain string
in that case\&.)
.PP
One final note, not directly related to subscripting: the numeric names
of positional parameters (described below) are parsed specially, so for example `\fB$2foo\fP\&' is equivalent to
`\fB${2}foo\fP\&'\&.  Therefore, to use subscript syntax to extract a substring
from a positional parameter, the expansion must be surrounded by braces;
for example, `\fB${2[3,5]}\fP\&' evaluates to the third through fifth
characters of the second positional parameter, but `\fB$2[3,5]\fP\&' is the
entire second parameter concatenated with the filename generation pattern
`\fB[3,5]\fP\&'\&.
.PP
.SH "POSITIONAL PARAMETERS"
The positional parameters provide access to the command\-line arguments
of a shell function, shell script, or the shell itself; see
the section `Invocation\&', and also the section `Functions'\&.
The parameter \fIn\fP, where \fIn\fP is a number,
is the \fIn\fPth positional parameter\&.
The parameter `\fB$0\fP\&' is a special case, see
the section `Parameters Set By The Shell\&'\&.
.PP
The parameters \fB*\fP, \fB@\fP and \fBargv\fP are
arrays containing all the positional parameters;
thus `\fB$argv[\fP\fIn\fP\fB]\fP\&', etc\&., is equivalent to simply `\fB$\fP\fIn\fP'\&.
Note that the options \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP or \fBKSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT\fP apply
to these arrays as well, so with either of those options set,
`\fB${argv[0]}\fP\&' is equivalent to `\fB$1\fP' and so on\&.
.PP
Positional parameters may be changed after the shell or function starts by
using the \fBset\fP builtin, by assigning to the \fBargv\fP array, or by direct
assignment of the form `\fIn\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP\&' where \fIn\fP is the number of
the positional parameter to be changed\&.  This also creates (with empty
values) any of the positions from 1 to \fIn\fP that do not already have
values\&.  Note that, because the positional parameters form an array, an
array assignment of the form `\fIn\fP\fB=(\fP\fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP\&' is
allowed, and has the effect of shifting all the values at positions greater
than \fIn\fP by as many positions as necessary to accommodate the new values\&.
.PP
.SH "LOCAL PARAMETERS"
Shell function executions delimit scopes for shell parameters\&.
(Parameters are dynamically scoped\&.)  The \fBtypeset\fP builtin, and its
alternative forms \fBdeclare\fP, \fBinteger\fP, \fBlocal\fP and \fBreadonly\fP
(but not \fBexport\fP), can be used to declare a parameter as being local
to the innermost scope\&.
.PP
When a parameter is read or assigned to, the
innermost existing parameter of that name is used\&.  (That is, the
local parameter hides any less\-local parameter\&.)  However, assigning
to a non\-existent parameter, or declaring a new parameter with \fBexport\fP,
causes it to be created in the \fIouter\fPmost scope\&.
.PP
Local parameters disappear when their scope ends\&.
\fBunset\fP can be used to delete a parameter while it is still in scope;
any outer parameter of the same name remains hidden\&.
.PP
Special parameters may also be made local; they retain their special
attributes unless either the existing or the newly\-created parameter
has the \fB\-h\fP (hide) attribute\&.  This may have unexpected effects:
there is no default value, so if there is no assignment at the
point the variable is made local, it will be set to an empty value (or zero
in the case of integers)\&.  
The following:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset PATH=/new/directory:$PATH\fP

.SH "PARAMETERS SET BY THE SHELL"

\fB#\fP <S>
The number of positional parameters in decimal\&.  Note that some confusion
may occur with the syntax \fB$#\fP\fIparam\fP which substitutes the length of
\fIparam\fP\&.  Use \fB${#}\fP to resolve ambiguities\&.  In particular, the
sequence `\fB$#\-\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\&' in an arithmetic expression is interpreted as
the length of the parameter \fB\-\fP, q\&.v\&.
.TP
\fBARGC\fP <S> <Z>
Same as \fB#\fP\&.

\fB$\fP <S>
The process ID of this shell\&.  Note that this indicates the original

\fB*\fP <S>
An array containing the positional parameters\&.
.TP
\fBargv\fP <S> <Z>
Same as \fB*\fP\&.  Assigning to \fBargv\fP changes the local positional

\fBERRNO\fP <S>
The value of errno (see \fIerrno\fP(3))

\fBFUNCNEST\fP <S>
Integer\&.  If greater than or equal to zero, the maximum nesting depth of
shell functions\&.  When it is exceeded, an error is raised at the point
where a function is called\&.  The default value is determined when
the shell is configured, but is typically 500\&.  Increasing
the value increases the danger of a runaway function recursion
causing the shell to crash\&.  Setting a negative value turns off
the check\&.
.TP
\fBGID\fP <S>
The real group ID of the shell process\&.  If you have sufficient privileges,

\fBHOST\fP
The current hostname\&.
.TP
\fBLINENO\fP <S>
The line number of the current line within the current script, sourced

number refers to the function as it appeared in the original definition,
not necessarily as displayed by the \fBfunctions\fP builtin\&.

\fBLOGNAME\fP
If the corresponding variable is not set in the environment of the
shell, it is initialized to the login name corresponding to the
current login session\&. This parameter is exported by default but
this can be disabled using the \fBtypeset\fP builtin\&.  The value

\fBRANDOM\fP <S>
A pseudo\-random integer from 0 to 32767, newly generated each time
this parameter is referenced\&.  The random number generator

Unlike other special parameters, the type of the \fBSECONDS\fP parameter can

\fBsignals\fP
An array containing the names of the signals\&.  Note that with
the standard zsh numbering of array indices, where the first element
has index 1, the signals are offset by 1 from the signal number
used by the operating system\&.  For example, on typical Unix\-like systems
\fBHUP\fP is signal number 1, but is referred to as \fB$signals[2]\fP\&.  This

\fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP <S>
In an \fBalways\fP block, indicates whether the preceding list of code

\fBTRY_BLOCK_INTERRUPT\fP <S>
This variable works in a similar way to \fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP, but
represents the status of an interrupt from the signal SIGINT, which

\fBKEYBOARD_HACK\fP
This variable defines a character to be removed from the end of the

\fBREPORTMEMORY\fP
If nonnegative, commands whose maximum resident set size (roughly
speaking, main memory usage) in kilobytes is greater than this
value have timing statistics reported\&.  The format used to output
statistics is the value of the \fBTIMEFMT\fP parameter, which is the same
as for the \fBREPORTTIME\fP variable and the \fBtime\fP builtin; note that
by default this does not output memory usage\&.  Appending
\fB" max RSS %M"\fP to the value of \fBTIMEFMT\fP causes it to output the
value that triggered the report\&.  If \fBREPORTTIME\fP is also in use,
at most a single report is printed for both triggers\&.  This feature
requires the \fBgetrusage()\fP system call, commonly supported by
modern Unix\-like systems\&.
.TP
\fBREPORTTIME\fP
If nonnegative, commands whose combined user and system execution times
(measured in seconds) are greater than this value have timing

If this parameter is set in a command\&'s environment, the shell runs the

command, and are reset when it finishes or is suspended\&. If the command is
suspended and continued later with the \fBfg\fP or \fBwait\fP builtins it will
see the modes specified by \fBSTTY\fP, as if it were not suspended\&.  This

\-CONT\fP\&'\&.  \fBSTTY\fP is ignored if the command is run in the background, or
if it is in the environment of the shell but not explicitly assigned to in
the input line\&. This avoids running stty at every external command by
accidentally exporting it\&. Also note that \fBSTTY\fP should not be used for
window size specifications; these will not be local to the command\&.

appended \fB/\fP, following which the user types `\fB&\fP\&'\&.  The default result
is `\fBDIR&\fP\&'\&.  With \fBZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS\fP set but without including
`\fB&\fP\&' the result is `\fBDIR/&\fP'\&.  With \fBZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS\fP set to
include `\fB&\fP\&' the result is `\fBDIR &\fP'\&.
.PP
Note that certain completions may provide their own suffix removal
or replacement behaviour which overrides the values described here\&.
See the completion system documentation in
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1)\&.

\fBZLE_RPROMPT_INDENT\fP <S>
If set, used to give the indentation between the right hand side of
the right prompt in the line editor as given by \fBRPS1\fP or \fBRPROMPT\fP
and the right hand side of the screen\&.  If not set, the value 1 is used\&.

.PP
Typically this will be used to set the value to 0 so that the prompt
appears flush with the right hand side of the screen\&.  This is not the
default as many terminals do not handle this correctly, in particular
when the prompt appears at the extreme bottom right of the screen\&.
Recent virtual terminals are more likely to handle this case correctly\&.
Some experimentation is necessary\&.

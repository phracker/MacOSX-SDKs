.Dt GETAUDIT_ADDR 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getaudit_addr ,
.Nm getaudit(NOW DEPRECATED)
.Nd "retrieve audit session state"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In bsm/audit.h
.In bsm/audit_session.h
.Ft int
.Fn getaudit_addr "auditinfo_addr_t *auditinfo_addr" "u_int length"
.Sh SYNOPSIS (NOW DEPRECATED)
.In bsm/audit.h
.Ft int
.Fn getaudit "auditinfo_t *auditinfo"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getaudit_addr
system call
retrieves extended state via
.Fa auditinfo_addr
and
.Fa length .
It
uses the
.Fa auditinfo_addr_t
data structure supports Terminal IDs incuding those with larger addresses such
as those used in IP version 6.  It is defined as follows:
.nf
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct auditinfo_addr {
	au_id_t         ai_auid;        /* Audit user ID. */
	au_mask_t       ai_mask;        /* Audit masks. */
	au_tid_addr_t   ai_termid;      /* Terminal ID. */
	au_asid_t       ai_asid;        /* Audit session ID. */
	u_int64_t       ai_flags;       /* Audit session flags. */
};
typedef struct auditinfo_addr   auditinfo_addr_t;
.Ed
.fi
.Pp
The
.Fa ai_auid
variable contains the audit identifier which is recorded in the audit log for
each event the process caused.
.Pp
The
.Fa au_mask_t
data structure defines the bit mask for auditing successful and failed events
out of the predefined list of event classes.
It is defined as follows:
.nf
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct au_mask {
	unsigned int    am_success;     /* success bits */
	unsigned int    am_failure;     /* failure bits */
};
typedef struct au_mask  au_mask_t;
.Ed
.fi
.Pp
The
.Fa au_tid_addr_t
data structure which includes a larger address storage field and an additional
field with the type of address stored:
.nf
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct au_tid_addr {
	dev_t           at_port;
	u_int32_t       at_type;
	u_int32_t       at_addr[4];
};
typedef struct au_tid_addr      au_tid_addr_t;
.Ed
.fi
.Pp
The
.Fa ai_asid
variable contains the audit session ID which is recorded with every event
caused by the process.
.Pp
The
.Fa ai_flags
variable contains flags that are opaque to the kernel and used by various
consumers of the
.Fa auditinfo_addr
data.
Please see the
.Ao Pa bsm/audit_session.h Ac
header file for more information
and flag definitions for this platform.
.Pp
Without appropriate privilege the audit mask fields will be set to all
ones.
.Pp
The
.Fn getaudit
system call (NOW DEPRECATED)
retrieves the active audit session state for the current process via the
.Vt auditinfo_t
pointed to by
.Fa auditinfo .
.Pp
The
.Fa auditinfo_t
data structure (NOW DEPRECATED) is defined as follows:
.nf
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct auditinfo {
	au_id_t        ai_auid;         /* Audit user ID */
	au_mask_t      ai_mask;         /* Audit masks */
	au_tid_t       ai_termid;       /* Terminal ID */
	au_asid_t      ai_asid;         /* Audit session ID */
};
typedef struct auditinfo        auditinfo_t;
.Ed
.fi
.Pp
The
.Fa au_termid_t
data structure (NOW DEPRECATED) defines the Terminal ID recorded with
every event caused by the process.
It is defined as follows:
.nf
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct au_tid {
	dev_t           port;
	u_int32_t       machine;
};
typedef struct au_tid   au_tid_t;
.Ed
.fi
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std getaudit_addr
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn getaudit_addr
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
A failure occurred while data transferred to or from
the kernel failed.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Illegal argument was passed by a system call.
.It Bq Er EOVERFLOW
The
.Fa length
argument indicates an overflow condition will occur.
.It Bq Er ERANGE
The address is too big.

.Sh HISTORY
The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer Inc.\& in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.
.Pp
.Fn getaudit_addr
replaced
.Fn getaudit
in Mac OS X 10.7 to support longer terminal addresses such as those used
by IP version 6.
.Fn getaudit
is now deprecated and
.Fn getaudit_addr
should be used instead.

which is guaranteed to have at least 20 slots.  The entries in
the descriptor table are numbered with small integers starting at 0.
The call
.Fn getdtablesize
returns the size of this table.
.Sh LEGACY
The
.Xr getrlimit 2
function returns a value of type 
.Ft rlim_t .
This interface, returning an 
.Ft int ,
may have problems representing appropriate values in the future.
Applications should use the 
.Xr getrlimit 2
function instead.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtrace \fIoption\fR ?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command causes Tcl commands to be executed whenever certain operations are
invoked.  The legal \fIoption\fRs (which may be abbreviated) are:
.TP
\fBtrace add \fItype name ops ?args?\fR
Where \fItype\fR is \fBcommand\fR, \fBexecution\fR, or \fBvariable\fR.
.RS
.TP
\fBtrace add command\fR \fIname ops commandPrefix\fR
.
Arrange for \fIcommandPrefix\fR to be executed (with additional arguments)
whenever command \fIname\fR is modified in one of the ways given by the list
\fIops\fR. \fIName\fR will be resolved using the usual namespace resolution
rules used by commands. If the command does not exist, an error will be
thrown.
.RS
.PP
\fIOps\fR indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list of
one or more of the following items:
.TP
\fBrename\fR
.
Invoke \fIcommandPrefix\fR whenever the traced command is renamed.  Note that
renaming to the empty string is considered deletion, and will not be traced
with
.QW \fBrename\fR .
.TP
\fBdelete\fR
.
Invoke \fIcommandPrefix\fR when the traced command is deleted. Commands can be
deleted explicitly by using the \fBrename\fR command to rename the command to
an empty string. Commands are also deleted when the interpreter is deleted,
but traces will not be invoked because there is no interpreter in which to
execute them.
.PP
When the trace triggers, depending on the operations being traced, a number of
arguments are appended to \fIcommandPrefix\fR so that the actual command is as
follows:
.CS
\fIcommandPrefix oldName newName op\fR
.CE
\fIOldName\fR and \fInewName\fR give the traced command's current (old) name,
and the name to which it is being renamed (the empty string if this is a
.QW delete
operation).
\fIOp\fR indicates what operation is being performed on the
command, and is one of \fBrename\fR or \fBdelete\fR as
defined above.  The trace operation cannot be used to stop a command
from being deleted.  Tcl will always remove the command once the trace
is complete.  Recursive renaming or deleting will not cause further traces
of the same type to be evaluated, so a delete trace which itself
deletes the command, or a rename trace which itself renames the
command will not cause further trace evaluations to occur.
Both \fIoldName\fR and \fInewName\fR are fully qualified with any namespace(s)
in which they appear.
.RE
.TP
\fBtrace add execution\fR \fIname ops commandPrefix\fR
.
Arrange for \fIcommandPrefix\fR to be executed (with additional arguments)
whenever command \fIname\fR is executed, with traces occurring at the points
indicated by the list \fIops\fR.  \fIName\fR will be resolved using the usual
namespace resolution rules used by commands.  If the command does not exist,
an error will be thrown.
.RS
.PP
\fIOps\fR indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list of
one or more of the following items:
.TP
\fBenter\fR
Invoke \fIcommandPrefix\fR whenever the command \fIname\fR is executed,
just before the actual execution takes place.
.TP
\fBleave\fR
Invoke \fIcommandPrefix\fR whenever the command \fIname\fR is executed,
just after the actual execution takes place.
.TP
\fBenterstep\fR
.
Invoke \fIcommandPrefix\fR for every Tcl command which is executed from the
start of the execution of the procedure \fIname\fR until that
procedure finishes. \fICommandPrefix\fR is invoked just before the actual
execution of the Tcl command being reported takes place.  For example
if we have
.QW "proc foo {} { puts \N'34'hello\N'34' }" ,
then an \fIenterstep\fR trace would be invoked just before
.QW "\fIputs \N'34'hello\N'34'\fR"
is executed.
Setting an \fIenterstep\fR trace on a command \fIname\fR that does not refer
to a procedure will not result in an error and is simply ignored.
.TP
\fBleavestep\fR
.
Invoke \fIcommandPrefix\fR for every Tcl command which is executed from the
start of the execution of the procedure \fIname\fR until that
procedure finishes. \fICommandPrefix\fR is invoked just after the actual
execution of the Tcl command being reported takes place.
Setting a \fIleavestep\fR trace on a command \fIname\fR that does not refer to
a procedure will not result in an error and is simply ignored.
.PP
When the trace triggers, depending on the operations being traced, a
number of arguments are appended to \fIcommandPrefix\fR so that the actual
command is as follows:
.PP
For \fBenter\fR and \fBenterstep\fR operations:
.CS
\fIcommandPrefix command-string op\fR
.CE
\fICommand-string\fR gives the complete current command being
executed (the traced command for a \fBenter\fR operation, an
arbitrary command for a \fBenterstep\fR operation), including
all arguments in their fully expanded form.
\fIOp\fR indicates what operation is being performed on the
command execution, and is one of \fBenter\fR or \fBenterstep\fR as
defined above.  The trace operation can be used to stop the
command from executing, by deleting the command in question.  Of
course when the command is subsequently executed, an
.QW "invalid command"
error will occur.
.PP
For \fBleave\fR and \fBleavestep\fR operations:
.CS
\fIcommand command-string code result op\fR
.CE
\fICommand-string\fR gives the complete current command being
executed (the traced command for a \fBenter\fR operation, an
arbitrary command for a \fBenterstep\fR operation), including
all arguments in their fully expanded form.
\fICode\fR gives the result code of that execution, and \fIresult\fR
the result string.
\fIOp\fR indicates what operation is being performed on the
command execution, and is one of \fBleave\fR or \fBleavestep\fR as
defined above.
Note that the creation of many \fBenterstep\fR or
\fBleavestep\fR traces can lead to unintuitive results, since the
invoked commands from one trace can themselves lead to further
command invocations for other traces.
.PP
\fICommandPrefix\fR executes in the same context as the code that invoked
the traced operation: thus the \fIcommandPrefix\fR, if invoked from a
procedure, will have access to the same local variables as code in the
procedure. This context may be different than the context in which the trace
was created. If \fIcommandPrefix\fR invokes a procedure (which it normally
does) then the procedure will have to use \fBupvar\fR or \fBuplevel\fR
commands if it wishes to access the local variables of the code which invoked
the trace operation.
.PP
While \fIcommandPrefix\fR is executing during an execution trace, traces
on \fIname\fR are temporarily disabled. This allows the \fIcommandPrefix\fR
to execute \fIname\fR in its body without invoking any other traces again.
If an error occurs while executing the \fIcommandPrefix\fR, then the
command \fIname\fR as a whole will return that same error.
.PP
When multiple traces are set on \fIname\fR, then for \fIenter\fR
and \fIenterstep\fR operations, the traced commands are invoked
in the reverse order of how the traces were originally created;
and for \fIleave\fR and \fIleavestep\fR operations, the traced
commands are invoked in the original order of creation.
.PP
The behavior of execution traces is currently undefined for a command
\fIname\fR imported into another namespace.
.RE
.TP
\fBtrace add variable\fI name ops commandPrefix\fR
Arrange for \fIcommandPrefix\fR to be executed whenever variable \fIname\fR
is accessed in one of the ways given by the list \fIops\fR.  \fIName\fR may
refer to a normal variable, an element of an array, or to an array
as a whole (i.e. \fIname\fR may be just the name of an array, with no
parenthesized index).  If \fIname\fR refers to a whole array, then
\fIcommandPrefix\fR is invoked whenever any element of the array is
manipulated.  If the variable does not exist, it will be created but
will not be given a value, so it will be visible to \fBnamespace which\fR
queries, but not to \fBinfo exists\fR queries.
.RS
.PP
\fIOps\fR indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list of
one or more of the following items:
.TP
\fBarray\fR
Invoke \fIcommandPrefix\fR whenever the variable is accessed or modified via
the \fBarray\fR command, provided that \fIname\fR is not a scalar
variable at the time that the \fBarray\fR command is invoked.  If
\fIname\fR is a scalar variable, the access via the \fBarray\fR
command will not trigger the trace.
.TP
\fBread\fR
Invoke \fIcommandPrefix\fR whenever the variable is read.
.TP
\fBwrite\fR
Invoke \fIcommandPrefix\fR whenever the variable is written.
.TP
\fBunset\fR
Invoke \fIcommandPrefix\fR whenever the variable is unset.  Variables
can be unset explicitly with the \fBunset\fR command, or
implicitly when procedures return (all of their local variables
are unset).  Variables are also unset when interpreters are
deleted, but traces will not be invoked because there is no
interpreter in which to execute them.
.PP
When the trace triggers, three arguments are appended to
\fIcommandPrefix\fR so that the actual command is as follows:
.CS
\fIcommandPrefix name1 name2 op\fR
.CE
\fIName1\fR and \fIname2\fR give the name(s) for the variable
being accessed:  if the variable is a scalar then \fIname1\fR
gives the variable's name and \fIname2\fR is an empty string;
if the variable is an array element then \fIname1\fR gives the
name of the array and name2 gives the index into the array;
if an entire array is being deleted and the trace was registered
on the overall array, rather than a single element, then \fIname1\fR
gives the array name and \fIname2\fR is an empty string.
\fIName1\fR and \fIname2\fR are not necessarily the same as the
name used in the \fBtrace variable\fR command:  the \fBupvar\fR
command allows a procedure to reference a variable under a
different name.
\fIOp\fR indicates what operation is being performed on the
variable, and is one of \fBread\fR, \fBwrite\fR, or \fBunset\fR as
defined above.
.PP
\fICommandPrefix\fR executes in the same context as the code that invoked
the traced operation:  if the variable was accessed as part of a Tcl
procedure, then \fIcommandPrefix\fR will have access to the same local
variables as code in the procedure.  This context may be different
than the context in which the trace was created. If \fIcommandPrefix\fR
invokes a procedure (which it normally does) then the procedure will
have to use \fBupvar\fR or \fBuplevel\fR if it wishes to access the
traced variable.  Note also that \fIname1\fR may not necessarily be
the same as the name used to set the trace on the variable;
differences can occur if the access is made through a variable defined
with the \fBupvar\fR command.
.PP
For read and write traces, \fIcommandPrefix\fR can modify the variable to
affect the result of the traced operation.  If \fIcommandPrefix\fR modifies
the value of a variable during a read or write trace, then the new
value will be returned as the result of the traced operation.  The
return value from  \fIcommandPrefix\fR is ignored except that if it returns
an error of any sort then the traced operation also returns an error
with the same error message returned by the trace command (this
mechanism can be used to implement read-only variables, for example).
For write traces, \fIcommandPrefix\fR is invoked after the variable's value
has been changed; it can write a new value into the variable to
override the original value specified in the write operation.  To
implement read-only variables, \fIcommandPrefix\fR will have to restore the
old value of the variable.
.PP
While \fIcommandPrefix\fR is executing during a read or write trace, traces
on the variable are temporarily disabled.  This means that reads and
writes invoked by \fIcommandPrefix\fR will occur directly, without invoking
\fIcommandPrefix\fR (or any other traces) again.  However, if
\fIcommandPrefix\fR unsets the variable then unset traces will be invoked.
.PP
When an unset trace is invoked, the variable has already been deleted:
it will appear to be undefined with no traces.  If an unset occurs
because of a procedure return, then the trace will be invoked in the
variable context of the procedure being returned to:  the stack frame
of the returning procedure will no longer exist.  Traces are not
disabled during unset traces, so if an unset trace command creates a
new trace and accesses the variable, the trace will be invoked.  Any
errors in unset traces are ignored.
.PP
If there are multiple traces on a variable they are invoked in order
of creation, most-recent first.  If one trace returns an error, then
no further traces are invoked for the variable.  If an array element
has a trace set, and there is also a trace set on the array as a
whole, the trace on the overall array is invoked before the one on the
element.
.PP
Once created, the trace remains in effect either until the trace is
removed with the \fBtrace remove variable\fR command described below,
until the variable is unset, or until the interpreter is deleted.
Unsetting an element of array will remove any traces on that element,
but will not remove traces on the overall array.
.PP
This command returns an empty string.

These subcommands are deprecated and will likely be removed in a
future version of Tcl.  They use an older syntax in which \fBarray\fR,
\fBread\fR, \fBwrite\fR, \fBunset\fR are replaced by \fBa\fR, \fBr\fR,
\fBw\fR and \fBu\fR respectively, and the \fIops\fR argument is not a
list, but simply a string concatenation of the operations, such as
\fBrwua\fR.
.SH EXAMPLES
Print a message whenever either of the global variables \fBfoo\fR and
\fBbar\fR are updated, even if they have a different local name at the
time (which can be done with the \fBupvar\fR command):
.CS
proc tracer {varname args} {
    upvar #0 $varname var
    puts "$varname was updated to be \e"$var\e""
}
\fBtrace add\fR variable foo write "tracer foo"
\fBtrace add\fR variable bar write "tracer bar"
.CE
.PP
Ensure that the global variable \fBfoobar\fR always contains the
product of the global variables \fBfoo\fR and \fBbar\fR:
.CS
proc doMult args {
    global foo bar foobar
    set foobar [expr {$foo * $bar}]
}
\fBtrace add\fR variable foo write doMult
\fBtrace add\fR variable bar write doMult
.CE
.PP
Print a trace of what commands are executed during the processing of a Tcl
procedure:
.CS
proc x {} { y }

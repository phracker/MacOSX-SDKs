.Sh NAME
.Nm fstab
.Nd static information about the filesystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <fstab.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm fstab
contains descriptive information about the various file
systems.
.Nm fstab
is only read by programs, and not written;
it is the duty of the system administrator to properly create 
and maintain this file, using the
.Xr vifs 8
command.
Each filesystem is described on a separate line;
fields on each line are separated by tabs or spaces.
The order of records in
.Nm fstab
is important because
.Xr diskarbitrationd 8 ,
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
and
.Xr umount 8
sequentially iterate through
.Nm fstab
doing their thing.
.Pp
The first field,
.Pq Fa fs_spec ,
describes the block special device, the local filesystem, or
the remote filesystem to be mounted.  The
.Xr diskarbitrationd
program supports the identification of a local filesystem uniquely by its
UUID or by its volume name, irrespective of hardware configuration and of
hardware parallelism, using the constructs ``UUID'' and ``LABEL''.
For APFS volumes, this field should never be the block special device as it is
not constant. Only the constructs ``UUID'' and ``LABEL'' should be used.
.Pp
The second field,
.Pq Fa fs_file ,
describes the mount point for the filesystem.
For swap partitions, this field should be specified as ``none''.
.Pp
The third field,
.Pq Fa fs_vfstype ,
describes the type of the filesystem.
The system currently supports different filesystem types, including the following:
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset indent
.It Em apfs
APFS is the Mac OS X default filesystem since version 10.13 (High Sierra).
.It Em hfs 
HFS+ is the previous Mac OS X default filesystem.
.It Em nfs 
a Sun Microsystems compatible ``Network File System''
.It Em msdos
a DOS compatible filesystem
.It Em cd9660
a CD-ROM filesystem (as per ISO 9660)
.It Em fdesc
an implementation of /dev/fd
.It Em union
a translucent filesystem
.El
.Pp
The fourth field,
.Pq Fa fs_mntops ,
describes the mount options associated with the filesystem.
It is formatted as a comma separated list of options.
It contains at least the type of mount (see
.Fa fs_type
below) plus any additional options
appropriate to the filesystem type.
.Pp
The option ``auto'' can be used in the ``noauto'' form to cause
a file system not to be mounted automatically (with ``mount -a'',
or system boot time).
.Pp
The type of the mount is extracted from the
.Fa fs_mntops
field and stored separately in the
.Fa fs_type
field (it is not deleted from the
.Fa fs_mntops
field).
If
.Fa fs_type
is ``rw'' or ``ro'' then the filesystem whose name is given in the
.Fa fs_file
field is normally mounted read-write or read-only on the
specified special file.
If
.Fa fs_type
is ``sw'' then the special file is made available as a piece of swap
space by the
.Xr swapon 8
command at the end of the system reboot procedure.
The fields other than
.Fa fs_spec
and
.Fa fs_type
are unused.
If
.Fa fs_type
is specified as ``xx'' the entry is ignored.
This is useful to show disk partitions which are currently unused.
.Pp
The fifth field,
.Pq Fa fs_freq ,
is used for these filesystems by the
.Xr dump 8
command to determine which filesystems need to be dumped.
If the fifth field is not present, a value of zero is returned and
.Xr dump
will assume that the filesystem does not need to be dumped.
.Pp
The sixth field,
.Pq Fa fs_passno ,
is used by the
.Xr fsck 8
program to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done
at reboot time.
The root filesystem should be specified with a
.Fa fs_passno
of 1, and other filesystems should have a 
.Fa fs_passno
of 2.
Filesystems within a drive will be checked sequentially,
but filesystems on different drives will be checked at the
same time to utilize parallelism available in the hardware.
If the sixth field is not present or zero,
a value of zero is returned and
.Xr fsck
will assume that the filesystem does not need to be checked.

.Pp
The proper way to read records from
.Pa fstab
is to use the routines
.Xr getfsent 3 ,
.Xr getfsspec 3 ,
.Xr getfstype 3 ,
and
.Xr getfsfile 3 .

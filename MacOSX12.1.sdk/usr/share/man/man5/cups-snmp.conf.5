.TH snmp.conf 5 "CUPS" "26 April 2019" "Apple Inc."
.SH NAME
snmp.conf \- snmp configuration file for cups (deprecated)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B snmp.conf
file configures how the standard CUPS network backends (http, https, ipp, ipps, lpd, snmp, and socket) access printer information using SNMPv1 and is normally located in the \fI/etc/cups\fR directory.
Each line in the file can be a configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start with the # character.
.LP
The Community and DebugLevel directives are used by all backends. The remainder apply only to the SNMP backend -
.BR cups-snmp (8).
.SH DIRECTIVES
The following directives are understood by the CUPS network backends:
.TP 5
\fBAddress @IF(\fIname\fB)\fR
.TP 5
\fBAddress @LOCAL\fR
.TP 5
\fBAddress \fIaddress\fR
Sends SNMP broadcast queries (for discovery) to the specified address(es).
There is no default for the broadcast address.
.TP 5
\fBCommunity \fIname\fR
Specifies the community name to use.
Only a single community name may be specified.
The default community name is "public".
If no name is specified, all SNMP functions are disabled.
.TP 5
\fBDebugLevel \fInumber\fR
Specifies the logging level from 0 (none) to 3 (everything).
Typically only used for debugging (thus the name).
The default debug level is 0.
.TP 5
\fBDeviceURI "\fIregular expression\fB" \fIdevice-uri \fR[... \fIdevice-uri\fR]
Specifies one or more device URIs that should be used for a given make and model string.
The regular expression is used to match the detected make and model, and the device URI strings must be of the form "scheme://%s[:port]/[path]", where "%s" represents the detected address or hostname.
There are no default device URI matching rules.
.TP 5
\fBHostNameLookups on\fR
.TP 5
\fBHostNameLookups off\fR
Specifies whether the addresses of printers should be converted to hostnames or left as numeric IP addresses.
The default is "off".
.TP 5
\fBMaxRunTime \fIseconds\fR
Specifies the maximum number of seconds that the SNMP backend will scan the
network for printers.
The default is 120 seconds (2 minutes).
.SH NOTES
CUPS backends are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future feature release of CUPS.
Printers that do not support IPP can be supported using applications such as
.BR ippeveprinter (1).

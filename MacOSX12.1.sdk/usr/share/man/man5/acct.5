.Sh NAME
.Nm acct
.Nd execution accounting file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/acct.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The kernel maintains the following
.Fa acct
information structure for all
processes. If a process terminates, and accounting is enabled,
the kernel calls the
.Xr acct 2
function call to prepare and append the record
to the accounting file.
.Bd -literal
/*
 * Accounting structures; these use a comp_t type which is a 3 bits base 8
 * exponent, 13 bit fraction ``floating point'' number.  Units are 1/AHZ
 * seconds.
 */

If a terminated process was created by an
.Xr execve 2 ,
the name of the executed file (at most ten characters of it)
is saved in the field
.Fa ac_comm
and its status is saved by setting one of more of the following flags in
.Fa ac_flag:
.Dv AFORK ,
.Dv ASU ,
.Dv ACOMPAT ,
.Dv ACORE
and
.Dv ASIG .

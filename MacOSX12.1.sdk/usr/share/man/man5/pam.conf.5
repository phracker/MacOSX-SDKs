.Dt PAM.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pam.conf
.Nd PAM policy file format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The PAM library searches for policies in the following files, in
decreasing order of preference:
.Bl -enum
.It
.Pa /etc/pam.d/ Ns Ar service-name
.It
.Pa /etc/pam.conf
.It
.Pa /usr/local/etc/pam.d/ Ns Ar service-name
.It
.Pa /usr/local/etc/pam.conf
.El
.Pp
If none of these locations contains a policy for the given service,
the
.Dv default
policy is used instead, if it exists.
.Pp
Entries in per-service policy files must be of one of the two forms
below:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.Ar function-class control-flag module-path Op Ar arguments ...
.Ar function-class Cm include Ar other-service-name
.Ed
.Pp
Entries in
.Pa pam.conf Ns -style
policy files are of the same form, but are prefixed by an additional
field specifying the name of the service they apply to.
.Pp
In both types of policy files, blank lines are ignored, as is anything
to the right of a
.Ql #
sign.
.Pp
The
.Ar function-class
field specifies the class of functions the entry applies to, and is
one of:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm password"
.It Cm auth
Authentication functions
.Po
.Xr pam_authenticate 3 ,
.Xr pam_setcred 3
.Pc
.It Cm account
Account management functions
.Pq Xr pam_acct_mgmt 3
.It Cm session
Session handling functions
.Po
.Xr pam_open_session 3 ,
.Xr pam_close_session 3
.Pc
.It Cm password
Password management functions
.Pq Xr pam_chauthtok 3
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar control-flag
field determines how the result returned by the module affects the
flow of control through (and the final result of) the rest of the
chain, and is one of:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm sufficient"
.It Cm required
If this module succeeds, the result of the chain will be success
unless a later module fails.
If it fails, the rest of the chain still runs, but the final result
will be failure regardless of the success of later modules.
.It Cm requisite
If this module succeeds, the result of the chain will be success
unless a later module fails.
If it module fails, the chain is broken and the result is failure.
.It Cm sufficient
If this module succeeds, the chain is broken and the result is
success.
If it fails, the rest of the chain still runs, but the final result
will be failure unless a later module succeeds.
.It Cm binding
If this module succeeds, the chain is broken and the result is
success.
If it fails, the rest of the chain still runs, but the final result
will be failure regardless of the success of later modules.
.It Cm optional
If this module succeeds, the result of the chain will be success
unless a later module fails.
If this module fails, the result of the chain will be failure unless a
later module succeeds.
.El
.Pp
There are two exceptions to the above:
.Cm sufficient
and
.Cm binding
modules are treated as
.Cm optional
by
.Xr pam_setcred 3 ,
and in the
.Dv PAM_PRELIM_CHECK
phase of
.Xr pam_chauthtok 3 .
.Pp
The
.Ar module-path
field specifies the name, or optionally the full path, of the module
to call.
.Pp
The remaining fields are passed as arguments to the module if and when
it is invoked.
.Pp
The
.Cm include
form of entry causes entries from a different chain (specified by
.Ar other-system-name )
to be included in the current one.
This allows one to define system-wide policies which are then included
into service-specific policies.
The system-wide policy can then be modified without having to also
modify each and every service-specific policy.

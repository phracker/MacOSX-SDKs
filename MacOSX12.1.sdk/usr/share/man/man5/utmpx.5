.Sh NAME
.Nm utmpx
.Nd user accounting database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In utmpx.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In contrast to
.Pa utmp
and
.Pa wtmp ,
the extended databases in
.Pa utmpx
and
.Pa wtmpx
reserve more space for logging hostnames, and also
information on a process' ID, termination signal and exit status.
.Pp
The
.Aq Pa utmpx.h
header defines the structures and functions for logging user.
Currently logged in users are tracked in
.Pa /var/run/utmpx .
The interface to the
.Nm utmpx
file is described in
.Xr endutxent 3 .
The file is not automatically created if they do not exist; it
must be created manually.
.Pp
Traditionally, separate files would be used to store the running log of
the logins and logouts
.Pf ( Pa wtmpx ) ,
and the last login of each user
.Pf ( Pa lastlogx ) .
With the availability of the Apple system log facility
.Xr asl 3 ,
these separate files can be replace with log entries, which are automatically
generated when
.Nm utmpx
entries are written.
The API to access the logins and logouts is described in
.Xr endutxent_wtmp 3
while the last login info is accessible with
.Xr getlastlogx 3 .
.Pp
For compatibility, changes to
.Nm utmpx
are reflected in
.Xr utmp 3
(in the
.Pa utmp ,
.Pa wtmp
and
.Pa lastlog
files),
but not the other way around.

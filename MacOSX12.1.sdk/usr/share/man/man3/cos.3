.Sh NAME
.Nm cos
.Nd cosine function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn cos "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn cosl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn cosf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cos
function computes the cosine of
.Fa x
(measured in radians).
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn cos "±0"
returns 1.
.Pp
.Fn cos "±infinity"
returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn cos
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>

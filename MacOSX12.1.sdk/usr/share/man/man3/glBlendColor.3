\f2red\fP, \f2green\fP, \f2blue\fP, \f2alpha\fP
specify the components of \%\f3GL_BLEND_COLOR\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \%\f3GL_BLEND_COLOR\fP may be used to calculate the source and destination
blending factors. The color components are clamped to the range [0,\ 1]
before being stored. See \%\f3glBlendFunc\fP for a complete description of the
blending operations.
Initially the \%\f3GL_BLEND_COLOR\fP is set to (0, 0, 0, 0).
.SH NOTES
\%\f3glBlendColor\fP is part of the \%\f3GL_ARB_imaging\fP subset. \%\f3glBlendColor\fP is present only
if \%\f3GL_ARB_imaging\fP is returned when \%\f3glGetString\fP is called with
\%\f3GL_EXTENSIONS\fP as its argument.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glBlendColor\fP is executed
between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding
execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.

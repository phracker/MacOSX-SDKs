.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module configures Text::Diff and its related modules. Currently it contains
only one global variable \f(CW$Text::Diff::Config::Output_Unicode\fR  which is a boolean
flag, that if set outputs unicode characters as themselves without escaping them 
as \f(CW\*(C` \ex{HHHH} \*(C'\fR first.
.PP
It is initialized to the value of \f(CW $ENV{DIFF_OUTPUT_UNICODE} \fR, but can be
set to a different value at run-time, including using local.

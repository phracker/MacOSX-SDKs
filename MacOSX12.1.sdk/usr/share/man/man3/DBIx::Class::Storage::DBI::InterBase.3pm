.SH "NAME"
DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::InterBase \- Driver for the Firebird RDBMS via
DBD::InterBase
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This driver is a subclass of DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Firebird::Common for
use with DBD::InterBase, see that driver for general details.
.PP
You need to use either the
disable_sth_caching option or
\&\*(L"connect_call_use_softcommit\*(R" (see \*(L"\s-1CAVEATS\*(R"\s0) for your code to function
correctly with this driver. Otherwise you will likely get bizarre error messages
such as \f(CW\*(C`no statement executing\*(C'\fR. The alternative is to use the
\&\s-1ODBC\s0 driver, which is more suitable
for long running processes such as under Catalyst.
.PP
To turn on DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime support, see
\&\*(L"connect_call_datetime_setup\*(R".
.SS "connect_call_use_softcommit"
.IX Subsection "connect_call_use_softcommit"
Used as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  on_connect_call => \*(Aquse_softcommit\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
In connect_info to set the
DBD::InterBase \f(CW\*(C`ib_softcommit\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
You need either this option or \f(CW\*(C`disable_sth_caching => 1\*(C'\fR for
DBIx::Class code to function correctly (otherwise you may get \f(CW\*(C`no statement
executing\*(C'\fR errors.) Or use the \s-1ODBC\s0
driver.
.PP
The downside of using this option is that your process will \fB\s-1NOT\s0\fR see UPDATEs,
INSERTs and DELETEs from other processes for already open statements.
.SS "connect_call_datetime_setup"
.IX Subsection "connect_call_datetime_setup"
Used as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  on_connect_call => \*(Aqdatetime_setup\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
In connect_info to set the date and
timestamp formats using:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->{ib_time_all} = \*(AqISO\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
See DBD::InterBase for more details.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`TIMESTAMP\*(C'\fR data type supports up to 4 digits after the decimal point for
second precision. The full precision is used.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`DATE\*(C'\fR data type stores the date portion only, and it \fB\s-1MUST\s0\fR be declared
with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  data_type => \*(Aqdate\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
in your Result class.
.PP
Timestamp columns can be declared with either \f(CW\*(C`datetime\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`timestamp\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You will need the DateTime::Format::Strptime module for inflation to work.
.PP
For DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ODBC::Firebird, this is a noop.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
.IP "\(bu" 4
with \*(L"connect_call_use_softcommit\*(R", you will not be able to see changes made
to data in other processes. If this is an issue, use
disable_sth_caching as a
workaround for the \f(CW\*(C`no statement executing\*(C'\fR errors, this of course adversely
affects performance.
.Sp
Alternately, use the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver.

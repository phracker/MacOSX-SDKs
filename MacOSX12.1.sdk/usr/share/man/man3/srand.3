.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
These interfaces are obsoleted by
.Xr arc4random 3 .
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn rand
function computes a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the range
of 0 to
.Dv RAND_MAX
(as defined by the header file
.In stdlib.h ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn srand
function sets its argument
.Fa seed
as the seed for a new sequence of
pseudo-random numbers to be returned by
.Fn rand .
These sequences are repeatable by calling
.Fn srand
with the same seed value.
.Pp
If no
.Fa seed
value is provided, the functions are automatically
seeded with a value of 1.
.Pp
The
.Fn sranddev
function initializes a seed, using the
.Xr random 4
random number device which returns good random numbers.
However, the
.Fn rand
function still remains unsuitable for cryptographic use.
.Pp
The
.Fn rand_r
function
provides the same functionality as
.Fn rand .
A pointer to the context value
.Fa seed
must be supplied by the caller.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arc4random 3 ,
.Xr random 3 ,
.Xr random 4
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn rand
and
.Fn srand
functions
conform to
.St -isoC .
.Pp
The
.Fn rand_r
function is as proposed in the POSIX.4a Draft #6 document.

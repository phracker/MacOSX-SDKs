.\" way too many mistakes in technical documents.

.SH "NAME"
List::MoreUtils::Contributing \- Gives rough introduction into contributing to List::MoreUtils
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
List::Moreutils has a turbulent history and a strong approach. Before
going further, please step to
Open Source Contribution Etiquette <http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html>
and then come back.
.PP
The current distribution is a balance between finishing the history and
claiming for future requirements. Therefore some components will receive
a rewrite on purpose \- others won't.
.PP
For the moment \- it's not the primary goal to clean up the configuration
stage, until the primary goals and prerequisites are done.
.PP
To contribute to List::MoreUtils, one has to arrange with the current
situation, dig into details and ask for clarifying when parts are
incomprehensible.
.SS "Primary Goals"
.IX Subsection "Primary Goals"
The very first primary goal is to clear the backlog. These are primarily
the open issues, feature requests and missing infrastructure elements.
.PP
As example see RT#93207 or RT#75672 for missing configure time checks,
while RT#93207 radiates until test \- but doesn't affect runtime nor
installation (beside test failures).
.SS "Secondary Goals"
.IX Subsection "Secondary Goals"
Secondary goals are harmonizing the function names and calling convention
(see RT#102673), tidying the infrastructure of the distribution and remove
unnecessary complexity (while protecting the necessary).
.PP
One example of removing unnecessary infrastructure could be to move
Data::Tumbler and Test::WriteVariants into authoring mode, when
improved test for RT#93207 could be reasonably done by a module which
is recommended for test. The recommendation of
Graham Knop's Makefile.PL#L82 <https://github.com/haarg/List-MoreUtils/blob/dd877f963deead742fc90005636c72c6be9060fc/Makefile.PL#L82>
in PR#9 <https://github.com/perl5-utils/List-MoreUtils/pull/9> a desirable
one.
.SS "Orientation Guide"
.IX Subsection "Orientation Guide"
List::MoreUtils configuration stage heavily depends on Config::AutoConf
and Data::Tumbler. A few prerequisites of both modules aren't available
for Perl 5.6 \- which leads to a tiny emulation layer t the begin of
\&\f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The reason for Config::AutoConf is quite simple \- the opportunities
for checking the environment cover a much wider range than a simple test
whether there is a working compiler. It requires a lot of improvements
since its base ExtUtils::CBuilder was never designed to support
that kind of solutions \- but there is \fIWork In Progress\fR. To finally
solve issues as RT#75672 even in cross-compile environments \- there is
no way around such a checking tool.
.PP
The reason for Data::Tumbler in combination with Test::WriteVariants
are extensible tests with reasonable effort and easy figuring out which
extra condition causes failures. Also \- missing pre-conditions should
result in failing tests i some cases \- what is fully supported by the
logic behind Data::Tumbler in combination with Test::WriteVariants.
.PP
Finally \- inc::latest glues the stuff in a bundle together to allow
people with older toolchains to use List::MoreUtils out of the box (maybe
with reduced quantity but full quality).

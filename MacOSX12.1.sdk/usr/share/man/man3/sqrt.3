.Sh NAME
.Nm sqrt 
.Nd square root function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn sqrt "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn sqrtl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn sqrtf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sqrt
function compute
the non-negative square root of x.
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn sqrt "-0"
returns -0.
.Pp
.Fn sqrt "x"
returns a NaN and generates a domain error for x < 0.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn sqrt
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:

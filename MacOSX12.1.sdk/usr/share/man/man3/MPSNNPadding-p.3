.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
\fBA\fP method to describe how MPSCNNKernels should pad images when data outside the image is needed  Different (non-Apple) CNN frameworks have different policies for how to size the result of a CNN filter and what padding to add around the edges\&. Some filters such as pooling and convolution read from neighboring feature channel (pixel) values\&. Four predefined MPSPaddingMethods are available: MPSNNPaddingMethodValidOnly, MPSNNPaddingMethodFull, MPSNNPaddingMethodSameTL, MPSNNPaddingMethodSameBR\&. You may also implement your own padding definition with a block that conforms to this prototype\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
If you don't know anything about automated testing in Perl then you should
probably read about Test::Simple and Test::More before preceding.
Test::Deep uses the Test::Builder framework.
.PP
Test::Deep gives you very flexible ways to check that the result you got is
the result you were expecting. At its simplest it compares two structures
by going through each level, ensuring that the values match, that arrays and
hashes have the same elements and that references are blessed into the
correct class. It also handles circular data structures without getting
caught in an infinite loop.
.PP
Where it becomes more interesting is in allowing you to do something besides
simple exact comparisons. With strings, the \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR operator checks that 2
strings are exactly equal but sometimes that's not what you want. When you
don't know exactly what the string should be but you do know some things
about how it should look, \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR is no good and you must use pattern matching
instead. Test::Deep provides pattern matching for complex data structures
.PP
Test::Deep has \fB\f(BIa lot\fB\fR of exports.  See \*(L"\s-1EXPORTS\*(R"\s0 below.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
How Test::Deep works is much easier to understand by seeing some examples.
.SS "Without Test::Deep"
.IX Subsection "Without Test::Deep"
Say you want to test a function which returns a string. You know that your
string should be a 7 digit number beginning with 0, \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR is no good in this
situation, you need a regular expression. So you could use Test::More's
\&\f(CW\*(C`like()\*(C'\fR function:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  like($string, qr/^0[0\-9]{6}$/, "number looks good");
.Ve
.PP
Similarly, to check that a string looks like a name, you could do:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  like($string, qr/^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \ew+ \ew+$/,
\&    "got title, first and last name");
.Ve
.PP
Now imagine your function produces a hash with some personal details in it.
You want to make sure that there are 2 keys, Name and Phone and that the
name looks like a name and the phone number looks like a phone number. You
could do:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  $hash = make_person();
\&  like($hash\->{Name}, qr/^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \ew+ \ew+$/, "name ok");
\&  like($hash\->{Phone}, qr/^0[0\-9]{6}$/, "phone ok");
\&  is(scalar keys %$hash, 2, "correct number of keys");
.Ve
.PP
But that's not quite right, what if make_person has a serious problem and
didn't even return a hash? We really need to write
.PP
.Vb 12
\&  if (ref($hash) eq "HASH")
\&  {
\&    like($hash\->{Name}, qr/^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \ew+ \ew+$/, "name ok");
\&    like($hash\->{Phone}, qr/^0[0\-9]{6}$/, "phone ok");
\&    is(scalar keys %$hash, 2, "correct number of keys");
\&  }
\&  else
\&  {
\&    fail("person not a hash");
\&    fail("person not a hash");
\&    fail("person not a hash"); # need 3 to keep the plan correct
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Already this is getting messy, now imagine another entry in the hash, an
array of children's names. This would require
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  if (ref($hash) eq "HASH")
\&  {
\&    like($hash\->{Name}, $name_pat, "name ok");
\&    like($hash\->{Phone}, \*(Aq/^0d{6}$/\*(Aq, "phone ok");
\&    my $cn = $hash\->{ChildNames};
\&    if (ref($cn) eq "ARRAY")
\&    {
\&      foreach my $child (@$cn)
\&      {
\&        like($child, $name_pat);
\&      }
\&    }
\&    else
\&    {
\&        fail("child names not an array")
\&    }
\&  }
\&  else
\&  {
\&    fail("person not a hash");
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
This is a horrible mess and because we don't know in advance how many
children's names there will be, we can't make a plan for our test anymore
(actually, we could but it would make things even more complicated).
.PP
Test::Deep to the rescue.
.SS "With Test::Deep"
.IX Subsection "With Test::Deep"
.Vb 10
\&  my $name_re = re(\*(Aq^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \ew+ \ew+$\*(Aq);
\&  cmp_deeply(
\&    $person,
\&    {
\&      Name => $name_re,
\&      Phone => re(\*(Aq^0d{6}$\*(Aq),
\&      ChildNames => array_each($name_re)
\&    },
\&    "person ok"
\&  );
.Ve
.PP
This will do everything that the messy code above does and it will give a
sensible message telling you exactly what went wrong if it finds a part of
\&\f(CW$person\fR that doesn't match the pattern. \f(CW\*(C`re()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`array_each()\*(C'\fR are
special function imported from Test::Deep. They create a marker that tells
Test::Deep that something different is happening here. Instead of just doing
a simple comparison and checking are two things exactly equal, it should do
something else.
.PP
If a person was asked to check that 2 structures are equal, they could print
them both out and compare them line by line. The markers above are similar
to writing a note in red pen on one of the printouts telling the person that
for this piece of the structure, they should stop doing simple line by line
comparison and do something else.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`re($regex)\*(C'\fR means that Test::Deep should check that the current piece of
data matches the regex in \f(CW$regex\fR. \f(CW\*(C`array_each($struct)\*(C'\fR means that
Test::Deep should expect the current piece of data to be an array and it
should check that every element of that array matches \f(CW$struct\fR.
In this case, every element of \f(CW\*(C`$person\->{ChildNames}\*(C'\fR should look like a
name. If say the 3rd one didn't you would get an error message something
like
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  Using Regexp on $data\->{ChildNames}[3]
\&     got    : \*(AqQueen John Paul Sartre\*(Aq
\&     expect : /^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \ew+ \ew+$/
.Ve
.PP
There are lots of other special comparisons available, see
\&\*(L"\s-1SPECIAL COMPARISONS PROVIDED\*(R"\s0 below for the full list.
.SS "Reusing structures"
.IX Subsection "Reusing structures"
Test::Deep is good for reusing test structures so you can do this
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  my $name_re = re(\*(Aq^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \ew+ \ew+$\*(Aq);
\&  my $person_cmp = {
\&    Name => $name_re,
\&    Phone => re(\*(Aq^0d{6}$\*(Aq),
\&    ChildNames => array_each($name_re)
\&  };
\&
\&  cmp_deeply($person1, $person_cmp, "person ok");
\&  cmp_deeply($person2, $person_cmp, "person ok");
\&  cmp_deeply($person3, $person_cmp, "person ok");
.Ve
.PP
You can even put \f(CW$person_cmp\fR in a module and let other people use it when
they are writing test scripts for modules that use your modules.
.PP
To make things a little more difficult, lets change the person data
structure so that instead of a list of ChildNames, it contains a list of
hashes, one for each child. So in fact our person structure will contain
other person structures which may contain other person structures and so on.
This is easy to handle with Test::Deep because Test::Deep structures can
include themselves. Simply do
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  my $name_re = re(\*(Aq^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \ew+ \ew+$\*(Aq);
\&  my $person_cmp = {
\&    Name => $name_re,
\&    Phone => re(\*(Aq^0d{6}$\*(Aq),
\&    # note no mention of Children here
\&  };
\&
\&  $person_cmp\->{Children} = array_each($person_cmp);
\&
\&  cmp_deeply($person, $person_cmp, "person ok");
.Ve
.PP
This will now check that \f(CW$person\fR\->{Children} is an array and that every
element of that array also matches \f(CW$person_cmp\fR, this includes checking
that its children also match the same pattern and so on.
.SS "Circular data structures"
.IX Subsection "Circular data structures"
A circular data structure is one which loops back on itself, you can make
one easily by doing
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my @b;
\&  my @a = (1, 2, 3, \e@b);
\&  push(@b, \e@a);
.Ve
.PP
now \f(CW@a\fR contains a reference to be \f(CW@b\fR and \f(CW@b\fR contains a reference to
\&\f(CW@a\fR. This causes problems if you have a program that wants to look inside
\&\f(CW@a\fR and keep looking deeper and deeper at every level, it could get caught
in an infinite loop looking into \f(CW@a\fR then \f(CW@b\fR then \f(CW@a\fR then \f(CW@b\fR and
so on.
.PP
Test::Deep avoids this problem so we can extend our example further by
saying that a person should also list their parents.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  my $name_re = re(\*(Aq^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \ew+ \ew+$\*(Aq);
\&  my $person_cmp = {
\&    Name => $name_re,
\&    Phone => re(\*(Aq^0d{6}$\*(Aq),
\&    # note no mention of Children here
\&  };
\&
\&  $person_cmp\->{Children} = each_array($person_cmp);
\&  $person_cmp\->{Parents} = each_array($person_cmp);
\&
\&  cmp_deeply($person, $person_cmp, "person ok");
.Ve
.PP
So this will check that for each child \f(CW$child\fR in \f(CW\*(C`$person\->{Children}\*(C'\fR
that the \f(CW\*(C`$child\->{Parents}\*(C'\fR matches \f(CW$person_cmp\fR however it is smart
enough not to get caught in an infinite loop where it keeps bouncing between
the same Parent and Child.
.SH "TERMINOLOGY"
.IX Header "TERMINOLOGY"
\&\f(CW\*(C`cmp_deeply($got, $expected, $name)\*(C'\fR takes 3 arguments. \f(CW$got\fR is the
structure that you are checking, you must not include any special
comparisons in this structure or you will get a fatal error. \f(CW$expected\fR
describes what Test::Deep will be looking for in \f(CW$got\fR. You can put special
comparisons in \f(CW$expected\fR if you want to.
.PP
As Test::Deep descends through the 2 structures, it compares them one piece
at a time, so at any point in the process, Test::Deep is thinking about 2
things \- the current value from \f(CW$got\fR and the current value from
\&\f(CW$expected\fR. In the documentation, I call them \f(CW$got_v\fR and \f(CW\*(C`exp_v\*(C'\fR
respectively.

which \f(CW$got\fR will be check. \f(CW$name\fR is the test name.
.PP
This is the main comparison function, the others are just wrappers around
this.  \f(CW$got\fR and \f(CW$expected\fR are compared recursively.  Each value in
\&\f(CW$expected\fR defines what's expected at the corresponding location in \f(CW$got\fR.
Simple scalars are compared with \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR.  References to structures like hashes
and arrays are compared recursively.
.PP
Items in \f(CW$expected\fR, though, can also represent complex tests that check for
numbers in a given range, hashes with at least a certain set of keys, a string
matching a regex, or many other things.

This is the same as \fBcmp_deeply()\fR except it just returns true or
false. It does not create diagnostics or talk to Test::Builder, but
if you want to use it in a non-testing environment then you should
import it through Test::Deep::NoTest. For example
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use Test::Deep::NoTest;
\&  print "a equals b" unless eq_deeply($a, $b);

otherwise the Test::Builder framework will be loaded and testing messages
will be output when your program ends.

to \f(CW\*(C`deep_diag\*(C'\fR.

However, this is testing so you should also check that the objects are

.PP
\&\f(CW$regexp\fR is either a regular expression reference produced with \f(CW\*(C`qr/.../\*(C'\fR
or a string which will be used to construct a regular expression.
.PP
\&\f(CW$capture_data\fR is optional and is used to check the strings captured by an
regex. This should can be an array ref or a Test::Deep comparator that works
on array refs.
.PP
\&\f(CW$flags\fR is an optional string which controls whether the regex runs as a
global match. If \f(CW$flags\fR is \*(L"g\*(R" then the regex will run as \f(CW\*(C`m/$regexp/g\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Without \f(CW$capture_data\fR, this simply compares \f(CW$got_v\fR with the regular
expression provided. So
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  cmp_deeply($got, [ re("ferg") ])
.Ve
.PP
is the equivalent of
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
With \f(CW$capture_data\fR,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  cmp_deeply($got, [re($regex, $capture_data)])

is the equivalent of
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my @data = $got\->[0] =~ /$regex/;
\&  cmp_deeply(\e@data, $capture_data);

So you can do something simple like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  cmp_deeply($got, re(qr/(\ed\ed)(\ew\ew)/, [25, "ab" ]))
.Ve
.PP
to check that \f(CW\*(C`(\ed\ed)\*(C'\fR was 25 and \f(CW\*(C`(\ew\ew)\*(C'\fR was \*(L"ab\*(R" but you can also use
Test::Deep objects to do more complex testing of the captured values

\&      set(qw( cat sheep dog )),
\&      "g"

.PP
here, the regex will match the string and will capture the animal names and
check that they match the specified set, in this case it will fail,
complaining that \*(L"goat\*(R" is not in the set.

If either test fails then the whole thing is considered a fail. This is a
short-circuit test, the testing is stopped after the first failure, although
in the future it may complete all tests so that diagnostics can be output
for all failures. When reporting failure, the parts are counted from 1.
.PP
Thanks to the magic of overloading, you can write
.PP
.Vb 1

as
.PP

Note \fBsingle\fR \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR not double, as \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR cannot be overloaded. This will
only work when there is a special comparison involved. If you write

Perl will turn this into

Soon after, your query function changes and all the results now have an \s-1ID\s0
field. Now your test is failing again because you left out \s-1ID\s0 from each of
the hashes. The problem is that the IDs are generated by the database and
you have no way of knowing what each person's \s-1ID\s0 is. With Test::Deep you can
change your query to
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  cmp_deeply(
\&    $result,
\&    [
\&      {Name => \*(AqJohn\*(Aq, Age => 25, ID => ignore()},
\&      {Name => \*(AqAnne\*(Aq, Age => 26, ID => ignore()},
\&      {Name => "Bill", Age => 47, ID => ignore()}
\&    ]
\&  );
.Ve
.PP
But your test still fails. Now, because you're using a database, you no
longer know what order the people will appear in. You could add a sort into
the database query but that could slow down your application. Instead you
can get Test::Deep to ignore the order of the array by doing a bag
comparison instead.
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  cmp_deeply(
\&    $result,
\&    bag(
\&      {Name => \*(AqJohn\*(Aq, Age => 25, ID => ignore()},
\&      {Name => \*(AqAnne\*(Aq, Age => 26, ID => ignore()},
\&      {Name => "Bill", Age => 47, ID => ignore()}
\&    )
\&  );

Finally person gets even more complicated and includes a new field called
Movies, this is a list of movies that the person has seen recently, again
these movies could also come back in any order so we need a bag inside our
other bag comparison, giving us something like
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  cmp_deeply(
\&  $result,
\&    bag(
\&      {Name => \*(AqJohn\*(Aq, Age => 25, ID => ignore(), Movies => bag(...)},
\&      {Name => \*(AqAnne\*(Aq, Age => 26, ID => ignore(), Movies => bag(...)},
\&      {Name => "Bill", Age => 47, ID => ignore(), Movies => bag(...)}

.SH "USING TEST::DEEP WITH TEST::BUILDER"
.IX Header "USING TEST::DEEP WITH TEST::BUILDER"
Combining \f(CW\*(C`cmp_details\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`deep_diag\*(C'\fR makes it possible to use
Test::Deep in your own test classes.
.PP
In a Test::Builder subclass, create a test method in the following
form:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  sub behaves_ok {
\&    my $self = shift;
\&    my $expected = shift;
\&    my $test_name = shift;
\&
\&    my $got = do_the_important_work_here();
\&
\&    my ($ok, $stack) = cmp_details($got, $expected);
\&    unless ($Test\->ok($ok, $test_name)) {
\&      my $diag = deep_diag($stack);
\&      $Test\->diag($diag);
\&    }
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
As the subclass defines a test class, not tests themselves, make sure it
uses Test::Deep::NoTest, not \f(CW\*(C`Test::Deep\*(C'\fR itself.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.IX Header "LIMITATIONS"
Currently any \s-1CODE, GLOB\s0 or \s-1IO\s0 refs will be compared using \fBshallow()\fR, which
means only their memory addresses are compared.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
There is a bug in set and bag compare to do with competing SCs. It only
occurs when you put certain special comparisons inside bag or set
comparisons you don't need to worry about it. The full details are in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`bag()\*(C'\fR docs. It will be fixed in an upcoming version.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
.SS "\s-1SPECIAL CARE WITH SPECIAL COMPARISONS IN SETS AND BAGS\s0"
.IX Subsection "SPECIAL CARE WITH SPECIAL COMPARISONS IN SETS AND BAGS"
If you use certain special comparisons within a bag or set comparison there is
a danger that a test will fail when it should have passed. It can only happen
if two or more special comparisons in the bag are competing to match elements.
Consider this comparison
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  cmp_deeply([\*(Aqfurry\*(Aq, \*(Aqfurball\*(Aq], bag(re("^fur"), re("furb")))
.Ve
.PP
There are two things that could happen, hopefully \f(CW\*(C`re("^fur")\*(C'\fR is paired with
\&\*(L"furry\*(R" and \f(CW\*(C`re("^furb")\*(C'\fR is paired with \*(L"furb\*(R" and everything is fine but it
could happen that \f(CW\*(C`re("^fur")\*(C'\fR is paired with \*(L"furball\*(R" and then \f(CW\*(C`re("^furb")\*(C'\fR
cannot find a match and so the test fails. Examples of other competing
comparisons are \f(CW\*(C`bag(1, 2, 2)\*(C'\fR vs \f(CW\*(C`set(1, 2)\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`methods(m1 => "v1", m2 => "v2")\*(C'\fR vs \f(CW\*(C`methods(m1 => "v1")\*(C'\fR
.PP
This problem is could be solved by using a slower and more complicated
algorithm for set and bag matching. Something for the future...
.SH "WHAT ARE SPECIAL COMPARISONS?"
.IX Header "WHAT ARE SPECIAL COMPARISONS?"
A special comparison (\s-1SC\s0) is simply an object that inherits from
Test::Deep::Cmp. Whenever \f(CW$expected_v\fR is an \s-1SC\s0 then instead of checking
\&\f(CW\*(C`$got_v eq $expected_v\*(C'\fR, we pass control over to the \s-1SC\s0 and let it do its
thing.
.PP
Test::Deep exports lots of \s-1SC\s0 constructors, to make it easy for you to use
them in your test scripts. For example is \f(CW\*(C`re("hello")\*(C'\fR is just a handy way
of creating a Test::Deep::Regexp object that will match any string containing
\&\*(L"hello\*(R". So
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  cmp_deeply([ \*(Aqa\*(Aq, \*(Aqb\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello world\*(Aq], [\*(Aqa\*(Aq, \*(Aqb\*(Aq, re("^hello")]);
.Ve
.PP
will check \f(CW\*(Aqa\*(Aq eq \*(Aqa\*(Aq\fR, \f(CW\*(Aqb\*(Aq eq \*(Aqb\*(Aq\fR but when it comes to comparing
\&\f(CW\*(Aqhello world\*(Aq\fR and \f(CW\*(C`re("^hello")\*(C'\fR it will see that
\&\f(CW$expected_v\fR is an \s-1SC\s0 and so will pass control to the Test::Deep::Regexp class
by do something like \f(CW\*(C`$expected_v\->descend($got_v)\*(C'\fR. The \f(CW\*(C`descend()\*(C'\fR
method should just return true or false.
.PP
This gives you enough to write your own SCs but I haven't documented how
diagnostics works because it's about to get an overhaul (theoretically).
.SH "EXPORTS"
.IX Header "EXPORTS"
By default, Test::Deep will export everything in its \f(CW\*(C`v0\*(C'\fR tag, as if you had
written:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Test::Deep \*(Aq:v0\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
Those things are:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  all any array array_each arrayelementsonly arraylength arraylengthonly bag
\&  blessed bool cmp_bag cmp_deeply cmp_methods cmp_set code eq_deeply hash
\&  hash_each hashkeys hashkeysonly ignore Isa isa listmethods methods noclass
\&  none noneof num obj_isa re reftype regexpmatches regexponly regexpref
\&  regexprefonly scalarrefonly scalref set shallow str subbagof subhashof
\&  subsetof superbagof superhashof supersetof useclass
.Ve
.PP
A slightly better set of exports is the \f(CW\*(C`v1\*(C'\fR set.  It's all the same things,
with the exception of \f(CW\*(C`Isa\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`blessed\*(C'\fR.  If you want to import
\&\*(L"everything\*(R", you probably want to \f(CW\*(C`use Test::Deep \*(Aq:V1\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR.
.PP
There's another magic export group:  \f(CW\*(C`:preload\*(C'\fR.  If that is specified, all of
the Test::Deep plugins will be loaded immediately instead of lazily.

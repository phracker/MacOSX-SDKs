.Sh NAME
.Nm fputs ,
.Nm puts
.Nd output a line to a stream
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdio.h
.Ft int
.Fo fputs
.Fa "const char *restrict s"
.Fa "FILE *restrict stream"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fo puts
.Fa "const char *s"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn fputs
writes the string pointed to by
.Fa s
to the stream pointed to by
.Fa stream .
.\" The terminating
.\" .Dv NUL
.\" character is not written.
.Pp
The function
.Fn puts
writes the string
.Fa s ,
and a terminating newline character,
to the stream
.Dv stdout .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions
.Fn fputs
and
.Fn puts
return a nonnegative integer on success and
.Dv EOF
on error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa stream
argument
is not a writable stream.
.El
.Pp
The functions
.Fn fputs
and
.Fn puts
may also fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the routines
.Xr write 2 .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
.Fn fputs
now returns a non-negative number (as opposed to 0)
on successful completion.
As a result, many tests (e.g., "fputs() == 0", "fputs() != 0")
do not give the desired result.
Use "fputs() != EOF" or "fputs() == EOF"
to determine success or failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ferror 3 ,
.Xr fputws 3 ,
.Xr putc 3 ,
.Xr stdio 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The functions
.Fn fputs
and
.Fn puts
conform to
.St -isoC .
While not mentioned in the standard, both
.Fn fputs
and
.Fn puts
print
.Ql (null)
if
.Fa str
is
.Dv NULL .

.SH "NAME"
Test2::API \- Primary interface for writing Test2 based testing tools.
.SH "***INTERNALS NOTE***"
.IX Header "***INTERNALS NOTE***"
\&\fBThe internals of this package are subject to change at any time!\fR The public
methods provided will not change in backwards-incompatible ways (once there is
a stable release), but the underlying implementation details might.
\&\fBDo not break encapsulation here!\fR
.PP
Currently the implementation is to create a single instance of the
Test2::API::Instance Object. All class methods defer to the single
instance. There is no public access to the singleton, and that is intentional.
The class methods provided by this package provide the only functionality
publicly exposed.
.PP
This is done primarily to avoid the problems Test::Builder had by exposing its
singleton. We do not want anyone to replace this singleton, rebless it, or
directly muck with its internals. If you need to do something and cannot
because of the restrictions placed here, then please report it as an issue. If
possible, we will create a way for you to implement your functionality without
exposing things that should not be exposed.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This package exports all the functions necessary to write and/or verify testing
tools. Using these building blocks you can begin writing test tools very
quickly. You are also provided with tools that help you to test the tools you
write.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.SS "\s-1WRITING A TOOL\s0"
.IX Subsection "WRITING A TOOL"
The \f(CW\*(C`context()\*(C'\fR method is your primary interface into the Test2 framework.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package My::Ok;
\&    use Test2::API qw/context/;
\&
\&    our @EXPORT = qw/my_ok/;
\&    use base \*(AqExporter\*(Aq;

\&    # Just like ok() from Test::More
\&    sub my_ok($;$) {
\&        my ($bool, $name) = @_;
\&        my $ctx = context(); # Get a context
\&        $ctx\->ok($bool, $name);
\&        $ctx\->release; # Release the context
\&        return $bool;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
See Test2::API::Context for a list of methods available on the context object.
.SS "\s-1TESTING YOUR TOOLS\s0"
.IX Subsection "TESTING YOUR TOOLS"
The \f(CW\*(C`intercept { ... }\*(C'\fR tool lets you temporarily intercept all events
generated by the test system:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Test2::API qw/intercept/;
\&
\&    use My::Ok qw/my_ok/;
\&
\&    my $events = intercept {
\&        # These events are not displayed
\&        my_ok(1, "pass");
\&        my_ok(0, "fail");
\&    };
\&
\&    my_ok(@$events == 2, "got 2 events, the pass and the fail");
\&    my_ok($events\->[0]\->pass, "first event passed");
\&    my_ok(!$events\->[1]\->pass, "second event failed");
.Ve
.PP
\fI\s-1DEEP EVENT INTERCEPTION\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "DEEP EVENT INTERCEPTION"
.PP
Normally \f(CW\*(C`intercept { ... }\*(C'\fR only intercepts events sent to the main hub (as
added by intercept itself). Nested hubs, such as those created by subtests,
will not be intercepted. This is normally what you will still see the nested
events by inspecting the subtest event. However there are times where you want
to verify each event as it is sent, in that case use \f(CW\*(C`intercept_deep { ... }\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    my $events = intercept_Deep {
\&        buffered_subtest foo => sub {
\&            ok(1, "pass");
\&        };
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW$events\fR in this case will contain 3 items:
.ie n .IP "The event from ""ok(1, ""pass"")""" 4
.el .IP "The event from \f(CWok(1, ``pass'')\fR" 4
.IX Item "The event from ok(1, ""pass"")"
.PD 0
.IP "The plan event for the subtest" 4
.IX Item "The plan event for the subtest"
.IP "The subtest event itself, with the first 2 events nested inside it as children." 4
.IX Item "The subtest event itself, with the first 2 events nested inside it as children."
.PD
.PP
This lets you see the order in which the events were sent, unlike
\&\f(CW\*(C`intercept { ... }\*(C'\fR which only lets you see events as the main hub sees them.
.SS "\s-1OTHER API FUNCTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "OTHER API FUNCTIONS"

All exports are optional. You must specify subs to import.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Test2::API qw/context intercept run_subtest/;
.Ve
.PP
This is the list of exports that are most commonly needed. If you are simply
writing a tool, then this is probably all you need. If you need something and
you cannot find it here, then you can also look at \*(L"\s-1OTHER API EXPORTS\*(R"\s0.
.PP
These exports lack the 'test2_' prefix because of how important/common they
are. Exports in the \*(L"\s-1OTHER API EXPORTS\*(R"\s0 section have the 'test2_' prefix to
ensure they stand out.

.PD
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`context()\*(C'\fR function will always return the current context. If
there is already a context active, it will be returned. If there is not an
active context, one will be generated. When a context is generated it will
default to using the file and line number where the currently running sub was
called from.
.PP
Please see \*(L"\s-1CRITICAL DETAILS\*(R"\s0 in Test2::API::Context for important rules about
what you can and cannot do with a context once it is obtained.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR This function will throw an exception if you ignore the context object
it returns.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR On perls 5.14+ a depth check is used to insure there are no context
leaks. This cannot be safely done on older perls due to
<https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127774>
You can forcefully enable it either by setting \f(CW\*(C`$ENV{T2_CHECK_DEPTH} = 1\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`$Test2::API::DO_DEPTH_CHECK = 1\*(C'\fR \fB\s-1BEFORE\s0\fR loading Test2::API.
.PP
\fI\s-1OPTIONAL PARAMETERS\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "OPTIONAL PARAMETERS"
.PP
All parameters to \f(CW\*(C`context\*(C'\fR are optional.
.ie n .IP "level => $int" 4
.el .IP "level => \f(CW$int\fR" 4
.IX Item "level => $int"
If you must obtain a context in a sub deeper than your entry point you can use
this to tell it how many \s-1EXTRA\s0 stack frames to look back. If this option is not
provided the default of \f(CW0\fR is used.
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    sub third_party_tool {

\&        my $ctx = context(level => 1);
\&        ...
\&        $ctx\->release;
\&    });
.Ve
.ie n .IP "wrapped => $int" 4
.el .IP "wrapped => \f(CW$int\fR" 4
.IX Item "wrapped => $int"
Use this if you need to write your own tool that wraps a call to \f(CW\*(C`context()\*(C'\fR
with the intent that it should return a context object.
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    sub my_context {
\&        my %params = ( wrapped => 0, @_ );
\&        $params{wrapped}++;
\&        my $ctx = context(%params);

\&
\&    sub my_tool {
\&        my $ctx = my_context();
\&        ...
\&        $ctx\->release;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
If you do not do this, then tools you call that also check for a context will
notice that the context they grabbed was created at the same stack depth, which
will trigger protective measures that warn you and destroy the existing
context.
.ie n .IP "stack => $stack" 4
.el .IP "stack => \f(CW$stack\fR" 4
.IX Item "stack => $stack"
Normally \f(CW\*(C`context()\*(C'\fR looks at the global hub stack. If you are maintaining
your own Test2::API::Stack instance you may pass it in to be used
instead of the global one.
.ie n .IP "hub => $hub" 4
.el .IP "hub => \f(CW$hub\fR" 4
.IX Item "hub => $hub"
Use this parameter if you want to obtain the context for a specific hub instead
of whatever one happens to be at the top of the stack.
.IP "on_init => sub { ... }" 4
.IX Item "on_init => sub { ... }"
This lets you provide a callback sub that will be called \fB\s-1ONLY\s0\fR if your call
to \f(CW\*(C`context()\*(C'\fR generated a new context. The callback \fB\s-1WILL NOT\s0\fR be called if
\&\f(CW\*(C`context()\*(C'\fR is returning an existing context. The only argument passed into
the callback will be the context object itself.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    sub foo {
\&        my $ctx = context(on_init => sub { \*(Aqwill run\*(Aq });
\&
\&        my $inner = sub {
\&            # This callback is not run since we are getting the existing
\&            # context from our parent sub.

\&            $ctx\->release;

\&        $inner\->();
\&
\&        $ctx\->release;
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "on_release => sub { ... }" 4
.IX Item "on_release => sub { ... }"
This lets you provide a callback sub that will be called when the context
instance is released. This callback will be added to the returned context even
if an existing context is returned. If multiple calls to context add callbacks,
then all will be called in reverse order when the context is finally released.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    sub foo {
\&        my $ctx = context(on_release => sub { \*(Aqwill run second\*(Aq });

This is intended as a shortcut that lets you release your context and return a
value in one statement. This function will get your context, and an optional
return value. It will release your context, then return your value. Scalar
context is always assumed.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    sub tool {
\&        my $ctx = context();
\&        ...
\&
\&        return release $ctx, 1;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
This tool is most useful when you want to return the value you get from calling
a function that needs to see the current context:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    my $ctx = context();
\&    my $out = some_tool(...);
\&    $ctx\->release;
\&    return $out;
.Ve
.PP
We can combine the last 3 lines of the above like so:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $ctx = context();
\&    release $ctx, some_tool(...);
.Ve
.SS "context_do(&;@)"
.IX Subsection "context_do(&;@)"
Usage:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    sub my_tool {
\&        context_do {
\&            my $ctx = shift;
\&
\&            my (@args) = @_;
\&
\&            $ctx\->ok(1, "pass");
\&
\&            ...
\&
\&            # No need to call $ctx\->release, done for you on scope exit.
\&        } @_;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Using this inside your test tool takes care of a lot of boilerplate for you. It
will ensure a context is acquired. It will capture and rethrow any exception. It
will insure the context is released when you are done. It preserves the
subroutine call context (array, scalar, void).
.PP
This is the safest way to write a test tool. The only two downsides to this are a
slight performance decrease, and some extra indentation in your source. If the
indentation is a problem for you then you can take a peek at the next section.

.PP
This tool will hide a context for the provided block of code. This means any
tools run inside the block will get a completely new context if they acquire
one. The new context will be inherited by tools nested below the one that
acquired it.
.PP
This will normally hide the current context for the top hub. If you need to
hide the context for a different hub you can pass in the optional \f(CW$hid\fR
parameter.
.SS "intercept(&)"

Usage:

\&        ok(0, "fail");
\&        ...
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
This function takes a codeblock as its only argument, and it has a prototype.
It will execute the codeblock, intercepting any generated events in the
process. It will return an array reference with all the generated event
objects. All events should be subclasses of Test2::Event.
.PP
This is a very low-level subtest tool. This is useful for writing tools which
produce subtests. This is not intended for people simply writing tests.
.SS "run_subtest(...)"

\&
\&    # or
\&
\&    run_subtest($NAME, \e&CODE, \e%PARAMS, @ARGS)
.Ve
.PP
This will run the provided codeblock with the args in \f(CW@args\fR. This codeblock
will be run as a subtest. A subtest is an isolated test state that is condensed
into a single Test2::Event::Subtest event, which contains all events
generated inside the subtest.
.PP
\fI\s-1ARGUMENTS:\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "ARGUMENTS:"
.ie n .IP "$NAME" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$NAME\fR" 4
.IX Item "$NAME"
The name of the subtest.
.IP "\e&CODE" 4
.IX Item "&CODE"
The code to run inside the subtest.
.ie n .IP "$BUFFERED or \e%PARAMS" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$BUFFERED\fR or \e%PARAMS" 4
.IX Item "$BUFFERED or %PARAMS"
If this is a simple scalar then it will be treated as a boolean for the
\&'buffered' setting. If this is a hash reference then it will be used as a
parameters hash. The param hash will be used for hub construction (with the
specified keys removed).
.Sp
Keys that are removed and used by run_subtest:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP "'buffered' => $bool" 4
.el .IP "'buffered' => \f(CW$bool\fR" 4
.IX Item "'buffered' => $bool"
Toggle buffered status.
.ie n .IP "'inherit_trace' => $bool" 4
.el .IP "'inherit_trace' => \f(CW$bool\fR" 4
.IX Item "'inherit_trace' => $bool"
Normally the subtest hub is pushed and the sub is allowed to generate its own
root context for the hub. When this setting is turned on a root context will be
created for the hub that shares the same trace as the current context.
.Sp
Set this to true if your tool is producing subtests without user-specified
subs.
.ie n .IP "'no_fork' => $bool" 4
.el .IP "'no_fork' => \f(CW$bool\fR" 4
.IX Item "'no_fork' => $bool"
Defaults to off. Normally forking inside a subtest will actually fork the
subtest, resulting in 2 final subtest events. This parameter will turn off that
behavior, only the original process/thread will return a final subtest event.

.IX Subsection "BUFFERED VS UNBUFFERED (OR STREAMED)"
.PP
Normally all events inside and outside a subtest are sent to the formatter
immediately by the hub. Sometimes it is desirable to hold off sending events
within a subtest until the subtest is complete. This usually depends on the
formatter being used.
.IP "Things not effected by this flag" 4
.IX Item "Things not effected by this flag"
In both cases events are generated and stored in an array. This array is
eventually used to populate the \f(CW\*(C`subevents\*(C'\fR attribute on the
Test2::Event::Subtest event that is generated at the end of the subtest.
This flag has no effect on this part, it always happens.
.Sp
At the end of the subtest, the final Test2::Event::Subtest event is sent to
the formatter.
.IP "Things that are effected by this flag" 4
.IX Item "Things that are effected by this flag"
The \f(CW\*(C`buffered\*(C'\fR attribute of the Test2::Event::Subtest event will be set to
the value of this flag. This means any formatter, listener, etc which looks at
the event will know if it was buffered.
.IP "Things that are formatter dependant" 4
.IX Item "Things that are formatter dependant"
Events within a buffered subtest may or may not be sent to the formatter as
they happen. If a formatter fails to specify then the default is to \fB\s-1NOT SEND\s0\fR
the events as they are generated, instead the formatter can pull them from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`subevents\*(C'\fR attribute.
.Sp
A formatter can specify by implementing the \f(CW\*(C`hide_buffered()\*(C'\fR method. If this
method returns true then events generated inside a buffered subtest will not be
sent independently of the final subtest event.
.PP
An example of how this is used is the Test2::Formatter::TAP formatter. For
unbuffered subtests the events are rendered as they are generated. At the end
of the subtest, the final subtest event is rendered, but the \f(CW\*(C`subevents\*(C'\fR
attribute is ignored. For buffered subtests the opposite occurs, the events are
\&\s-1NOT\s0 rendered as they are generated, instead the \f(CW\*(C`subevents\*(C'\fR attribute is used
to render them all at once. This is useful when running subtests tests in
parallel, since without it the output from subtests would be interleaved
together.

This will return true if the stack and \s-1IPC\s0 instances have already been

These functions return the filehandles that test output should be written to.
They are primarily useful when writing a custom formatter and code that turns
events into actual output (\s-1TAP,\s0 etc.).  They will return a dupe of the original
filehandles that formatted output can be sent to regardless of whatever state
the currently running test may have left \s-1STDOUT\s0 and \s-1STDERR\s0 in.

.Sh NAME
.Nm asin 
.Nd arc sine function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn asin "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn asinl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn asinf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn asin
function computes the principal value of the arc sine of
.Fa x .
The result is in the range
.Bk -words
.Bq -\*(Pi/2, +\*(Pi/2 .
.Ek
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn asin "±0"
returns ±0.
.Pp
.Fn asin "x"
returns a NAN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception for |x| > 1.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn asin
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vasinf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvasinf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvasin "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;

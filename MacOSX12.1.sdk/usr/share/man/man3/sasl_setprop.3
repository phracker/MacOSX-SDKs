.SH NAME
sasl_setprop \- Set a SASL property
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sasl/sasl.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B sasl_setprop
sets the value of a SASL property. For example an application should tell the SASL library about any external negotiated security layer (i.e. TLS).

.I conn
is the SASL connection object.
.I propnum
is the identifier for the property requested and
.I pvalue
contains a pointer to the data. It is the applications job to make sure this type is correct. This is an easy way to crash a program.

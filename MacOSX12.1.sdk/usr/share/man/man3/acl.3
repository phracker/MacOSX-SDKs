.Sh NAME
.Nm acl
.Nd introduction to the POSIX.1e ACL security API
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The system permits file systems to export Access Control Lists via the VFS, and
provides a library for userland access to and manipulation of these ACLs.
Not all file systems provide support for ACLs, and some may require that
ACL support be explicitly enabled by the administrator.
The library calls include routines to allocate, duplicate, retrieve, set,
and validate ACLs associated with file objects.
.Pp
This implementation of the POSIX.1e library differs from the standard
in a number of non-portable ways in order to support the MacOS/Darwin
ACL semantic.  Where possible, these differences are implemented using
the mechanisms provided in the standard for such extensions.
Where routines are non-standard, they are suffixed with _np to indicate that
they are not portable.
.Pp
POSIX.1e describes a set of ACL manipulation routines to manage the
contents of ACLs, as well as their relationships with files; almost
all of these support routines are implemented.
.Pp
Available functions, sorted by behavior, include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fn acl_add_perm
This function is described in
.Xr acl_add_perm 3 ,
and may be used to add permissions to a permission set.
.It Fn acl_clear_perms
This function is described in
.Xr acl_clear_perms 3 ,
and may be used to clear all permissions from a permission set.
.It Fn acl_copy_entry
This function is described in
.Xr acl_copy_entry 3 ,
and may be used to copy the contents of an ACL entry.
.It Fn acl_create_entry
This function is described in
.Xr acl_create_entry 3 ,
and may be used to create an empty entry in an ACL.
.It Fn acl_delete_entry
This function is described in
.Xr acl_delete_entry 3 ,
and may be used to delete an entry from an ACL.
.It Fn acl_delete_perm
This function is described in
.Xr acl_delete_perm 3 ,
and may be used to delete permissions from a permset.
.It Fn acl_dup
This function is described in
.Xr acl_dup 3 ,
and may be used to duplicate an ACL structure.
.It Fn acl_free
This function is described in
.Xr acl_free 3 ,
and may be used to free userland working ACL storage.
.It Fn acl_from_text
This function is described in
.Xr acl_from_text 3 ,
and may be used to convert a text-form ACL into working ACL state, if
the ACL has POSIX.1e semantics.
.It Fn acl_get_entry
This function is described in
.Xr acl_get_entry 3 ,
and may be used to retrieve a designated ACL entry from an ACL.
.It Xo
.Fn acl_get_fd ,
.Fn acl_get_fd_np ,
.Fn acl_get_file ,
.Fn acl_get_link_np
.Xc
These functions are described in
.Xr acl_get 3 ,
and may be used to retrieve ACLs from file system objects.
.It Fn acl_get_permset
This function is described in
.Xr acl_get_permset 3 ,
and may be used to retrieve a permset from an ACL entry.
.It Fn acl_get_qualifier
This function is described in
.Xr acl_get_qualifier 3 ,
and may be used to retrieve the qualifier from an ACL entry.
.It Fn acl_get_tag_type
This function is described in
.Xr acl_get_tag_type 3 ,
and may be used to retrieve the tag type from an ACL entry.

.It Xo
.Fn acl_set_fd ,
.Fn acl_set_fd_np ,
.Fn acl_set_file ,
.Fn acl_set_link_np
.Xc
These functions are described in
.Xr acl_set 3 ,
and may be used to assign an ACL to a file system object.
.It Fn acl_set_permset
This function is described in
.Xr acl_set_permset 3 ,
and may be used to set the permissions of an ACL entry from a permset.
.It Fn acl_set_qualifier
This function is described in
.Xr acl_set_qualifier 3 ,
and may be used to set the qualifier of an ACL.
.It Fn acl_set_tag_type
This function is described in
.Xr acl_set_tag_type 3 ,
and may be used to set the tag type of an ACL.
.It Fn acl_to_text
This function is described in
.Xr acl_to_text 3 ,
and may be used to generate a text-form of a POSIX.1e semantics ACL.
.It Xo
.Fn acl_valid ,
.Fn acl_valid_fd_np ,
.Fn acl_valid_file_np ,
.Fn acl_valid_link_np
.Xc
These functions are described in
.Xr acl_valid 3 ,
and may be used to validate an ACL as correct POSIX.1e-semantics, or
as appropriate for a particular file system object regardless of semantics.
.El
.Pp
The syscalls between the internal interfaces and the public library
routines may change over time, and as such are not documented.
They are not intended to be called directly without going through the
library.

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e assigns security labels to all objects, extending the security
functionality described in POSIX.1.
These additional labels provide fine-grained discretionary access control,
fine-grained capabilities, and labels necessary for mandatory access
control.
POSIX.2c describes a set of userland utilities for manipulating these
labels.
.Pp
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.

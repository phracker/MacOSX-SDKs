.Sh NAME
.Nm getlastlogx ,
.Nm getlastlogxbyname ,
.Nm getutmp ,
.Nm getutmpx ,
.Nm utmpxname
.Nd user accounting database functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In utmpx.h
.Ft struct lastlogx *
.Fn getlastlogx "uid_t uid" "struct lastlogx *ll"
.Ft struct lastlogx *
.Fn getlastlogxbyname "const char *name" "struct lastlogx *ll"
.Ft void
.Fn getutmp "const struct utmpx *ux" "struct utmp *u"
.Ft void
.Fn getutmpx "const struct utmp *u" "struct utmpx *ux"
.Ft int
.Fn utmpxname "const char *fname"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getlastlogx
function looks up the entry for the user with user id
.Fa uid
and returns it in
.Fa \&ll .
If the provided
.Fa \&ll
is
.Dv NULL ,
the necessary space will be allocated by
.Fn getlastlogx
and should be
.Fn free Ns d
by the caller.
The
.Fn getlastlogxbyname
function is similar to
.Fn getlastlogx ,
except the user name is passed.
.Pp
.Fn getutmp
function fills out the entries in the struct utmp
.Fa u
with the data provided in the struct utmpx
.Fa ux .
.Fn getutmpx
does the opposite, filling out the entries in the struct utmpx
.Fa ux
with the data provided in the struct utmp
.Fa u ,
and initializing all the unknown fields to 0.
The sole exception is the
.Fa ut_type
field, which will be initialized to
.Dv USER_PROCESS .
.Pp
A
.Ft struct lastlogx
is defined like this:
.Bd -literal
struct lastlogx {
        struct timeval ll_tv;           /* time entry was created */
        char ll_line[_UTX_LINESIZE];    /* tty name */
        char ll_host[_UTX_HOSTSIZE];    /* host name */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn utmpxname
function sets the default
.Xr utmpx 5
database file name to
.Fa fname .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn getlastlogx
and
.Fn getlastlogxbyname
return the found entry on success, or
.Dv NULL
if it could not open the database, could not find an entry matching
.Fa uid
or
.Fa name ,
or could not allocate the necessary space (in case
.Fa \&ll
was
.Dv NULL ) .
.Pp
.Fn utmpxname
returns 1 on success, or 0 if the supplied file name was too long or
did not end with
.Sq x .

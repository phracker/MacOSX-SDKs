.Sh NAME
.Nm remquo
.Nd floating-point remainder and quotient function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn remquo "double x" "double y" "int *quo"
.Ft long double
.Fn remquol "long double x" "long double y" "int *quo"
.Ft float
.Fn remquof "float x" "float y" "int *quo"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn remquo
functions compute the value r such that r = x - n*y, where n is the integer nearest the exact value of x/y.
.Pp
If there are two integers closest to x/y, n shall be the even one. If r is zero, it is given the same sign as x.
This is the same value that is returned by the 
.Fn remainder
function.
.Fn remquo
also calculates the lower seven bits of the integral quotient x/y, and gives that value the same sign as
x/y. It stores this signed value in the object pointed to by quo. 
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn remquo "x, y, quo"
returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception if x is infinite or y is 0.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn remquo
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vremquo "vFloat x" "vFloat y" "vUInt32 *q" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3 ,
.Xr remainder 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn remquo
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

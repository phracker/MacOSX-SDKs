.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::Tty\*(C'\fR is used internally by \f(CW\*(C`IO::Pty\*(C'\fR to create a pseudo-tty.
You wouldn't want to use it directly except to import constants, use
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::Pty\*(C'\fR.  For a list of importable constants, see
IO::Tty::Constant.
.PP
Windows is now supported, but \s-1ONLY\s0 under the Cygwin
environment, see <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>.
.PP
Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend.  From my
experience, any modern \s-1POSIX\s0 system should be fine.  Find below a list
of systems that \f(CW\*(C`IO::Tty\*(C'\fR should work on.  A more detailed table
(which is slowly getting out-of-date) is available from the project
pages document manager at SourceForge
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl/>.
.PP
If you have problems on your system and your system is listed in the
\&\*(L"verified\*(R" list, you probably have some non-standard setup, e.g. you
compiled your Linux-kernel yourself and disabled ptys (bummer!).
Please ask your friendly sysadmin for help.
.PP
If your system is not listed, unpack the latest version of \f(CW\*(C`IO::Tty\*(C'\fR,
do a \f(CW\*(Aqperl Makefile.PL; make; make test; uname \-a\*(Aq\fR and send me
(\fIRGiersig@cpan.org\fR) the results and I'll see what I can deduce from
that.  There are chances that it will work right out-of-the-box...
.PP
If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with
details (version number, distribution, etc. 'uname \-a' and 'perl \-V'
is a good start; also, the output from \*(L"perl Makefile.PL\*(R" contains a
lot of interesting info, so please include that as well) so I can get
an overview.  Thanks!
.SH "VERIFIED SYSTEMS, KNOWN ISSUES"
.IX Header "VERIFIED SYSTEMS, KNOWN ISSUES"
This is a list of systems that \f(CW\*(C`IO::Tty\*(C'\fR seems to work on ('make
test' passes) with comments about \*(L"features\*(R":
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1AIX 4.3\s0
.Sp
Returns \s-1EIO\s0 instead of \s-1EOF\s0 when the slave is closed.  Benign.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1AIX 5\s0.x
.IP "\(bu" 4
FreeBSD 4.4
.Sp
\&\s-1EOF\s0 on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP "\(bu" 4
OpenBSD 2.8
.Sp
The ioctl \s-1TIOCSCTTY\s0 sometimes fails.  This is also known in
Tcl/Expect, see http://expect.nist.gov/FAQ.html
.Sp
\&\s-1EOF\s0 on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Darwin 7.9.0
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1HPUX 10.20 & 11.00\s0
.Sp
\&\s-1EOF\s0 on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1IRIX 6.5\s0
.IP "\(bu" 4
Linux 2.2.x & 2.4.x
.Sp
Returns \s-1EIO\s0 instead of \s-1EOF\s0 when the slave is closed.  Benign.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1OSF 4.0\s0
.Sp
\&\s-1EOF\s0 on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Solaris 8, 2.7, 2.6
.Sp
Has the \*(L"feature\*(R" of returning \s-1EOF\s0 just once?!
.Sp
\&\s-1EOF\s0 on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Windows NT/2k/XP (under Cygwin)
.Sp
When you send (print) a too long line (>160 chars) to a non-raw pty,
the call just hangs forever and even \fIalarm()\fR cannot get you out.
Don't complain to me...
.Sp
\&\s-1EOF\s0 on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.
.IP "\(bu" 4
z/OS
.PP
The following systems have not been verified yet for this version, but
a previous version worked on them:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1SCO\s0 Unix
.IP "\(bu" 4
NetBSD
.Sp
probably the same as the other *BSDs...

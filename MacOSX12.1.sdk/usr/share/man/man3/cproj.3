.Sh NAME
.Nm cproj
.Nd projection onto the Riemann sphere
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <complex.h>
.Ft double complex
.Fn cproj "double complex z"
.Ft long double complex
.Fn cprojl "long double complex z"
.Ft float complex
.Fn cprojf "float complex z"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn cproj "z"
computes the projection of a complex floating-point number
.Fa z
onto the Riemann sphere: for any finite
.Fa z ,
.Fn cproj "z"
= z, but all complex infinities (including infinities with one NaN part)
project to positive infinity on the real axis.
.Pp
Specifically, if
.Fa z
= x + iy has an infinite part (one of x or y is infinity), then
.Fn cproj "z"
is equivalent to INFINITY + I*copysign(0.0,cimag(z)).
.Sh NOTE
.Fn cproj
projects onto the C99 "Riemann Sphere", which may not agree with the mathematical
notion of the Riemann Sphere; in particular, it has two infinites (inf ± 0i) and
four zeroes (±0 ± 0i).

.Xr complex 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn cproj
function conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

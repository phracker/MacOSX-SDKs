.SH C SPECIFICATION

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2tess\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2tess\fP
Specifies the tessellation object (created with \%\f3gluNewTess\fP).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluBeginPolygon\fP and \%\f3gluEndPolygon\fP delimit the definition of a
nonconvex polygon.
To define such a polygon, first call \%\f3gluBeginPolygon\fP.
Then define the contours of the polygon
by calling 
\%\f3gluTessVertex\fP for each vertex
and \%\f3gluNextContour\fP to start each new contour.
Finally, call \%\f3gluEndPolygon\fP
to signal the end of the definition.
See the \%\f3gluTessVertex\fP and 
\%\f3gluNextContour\fP reference pages for more details.
.P
Once \%\f3gluEndPolygon\fP is called, the polygon is tessellated, and the
resulting triangles are described through callbacks.
See \%\f3gluTessCallback\fP for descriptions of the callback functions.
.SH NOTES
This command is obsolete and is provided for backward compatibility
only. Calls to \%\f3gluBeginPolygon\fP are mapped to 
\%\f3gluTessBeginPolygon\fP
followed by 
\%\f3gluTessBeginContour\fP. Calls to \%\f3gluEndPolygon\fP are mapped
to \%\f3gluTessEndContour\fP followed by \%\f3gluTessEndPolygon\fP.
.SH EXAMPLE
A quadrilateral with a triangular hole in it can be described like this:
.sp
.Ex
gluBeginPolygon(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4);
gluNextContour(tobj, GLU_INTERIOR);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7);
gluEndPolygon(tobj);

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The header file math.h provides macros that define a number of useful numerical
constants.
.Sh LIST OF CONSTANTS
As required by the POSIX standard, these constants are double-precision literals,
with enough digits specified as to ensure that they are correctly rounded in
double-precision:
.Pp
.Dv M_E
.Pp
"Euler's constant" or e; the base of the natural logarithm.
.Pp
.Dv M_LOG2E
.br
.Dv M_LOG10E
.Pp
The logarithms of e in base 2 and 10, respectively.
.Pp
.Dv M_LN2
.br
.Dv M_LN10
.Pp
The natural logarithms of 2 and 10, respectively.  Note that these are the
reciprocals of the preceeding two values.
.Pp
.Dv M_PI
.br
.Dv M_PI_2
.br
.Dv M_PI_4
.Pp
pi, pi/2, and pi/4, respectively.
.Pp
.Dv M_1_PI
.br
.Dv M_2_PI
.Pp
1/pi and 2/pi, respectively.
.Pp
.Dv M_2_SQRTPI
.Pp
Two divided by the square root of pi.
.Pp
.Dv M_SQRT2
.br
.Dv M_SQRT_1_2
.Pp
The square root of two and its reciprocal, respectively.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \f(CW\*(C`Encode\*(C'\fR module provides the interface between Perl strings
and the rest of the system.  Perl strings are sequences of
\&\fIcharacters\fR.
.PP
The repertoire of characters that Perl can represent is a superset of those
defined by the Unicode Consortium. On most platforms the ordinal
values of a character as returned by \f(CW\*(C`ord(\f(CIS\f(CW)\*(C'\fR is the \fIUnicode
codepoint\fR for that character. The exceptions are platforms where
the legacy encoding is some variant of \s-1EBCDIC\s0 rather than a superset
of \s-1ASCII\s0; see perlebcdic.
.PP
During recent history, data is moved around a computer in 8\-bit chunks,
often called \*(L"bytes\*(R" but also known as \*(L"octets\*(R" in standards documents.
Perl is widely used to manipulate data of many types: not only strings of
characters representing human or computer languages, but also \*(L"binary\*(R"
data, being the machine's representation of numbers, pixels in an image, or
just about anything.
.PP
When Perl is processing \*(L"binary data\*(R", the programmer wants Perl to
process \*(L"sequences of bytes\*(R". This is not a problem for Perl: because a
byte has 256 possible values, it easily fits in Perl's much larger
\&\*(L"logical character\*(R".
.PP
This document mostly explains the \fIhow\fR. perlunitut and perlunifaq
explain the \fIwhy\fR.

.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $octets  = encode(ENCODING, STRING[, CHECK])
.Ve
.PP
Encodes the scalar value \fI\s-1STRING\s0\fR from Perl's internal form into
\&\fI\s-1ENCODING\s0\fR and returns a sequence of octets.  \fI\s-1ENCODING\s0\fR can be either a
canonical name or an alias.  For encoding names and aliases, see
\&\*(L"Defining Aliases\*(R".  For \s-1CHECK,\s0 see \*(L"Handling Malformed Data\*(R".
.PP
For example, to convert a string from Perl's internal format into
\&\s-1ISO\-8859\-1,\s0 also known as Latin1:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $octets = encode("iso\-8859\-1", $string);
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB\s-1CAVEAT\s0\fR: When you run \f(CW\*(C`$octets = encode("utf8", $string)\*(C'\fR, then
\&\f(CW$octets\fR \fImight not be equal to\fR \f(CW$string\fR.  Though both contain the
same data, the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag for \f(CW$octets\fR is \fIalways\fR off.  When you
encode anything, the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag on the result is always off, even when it
contains a completely valid utf8 string. See \*(L"The \s-1UTF8\s0 flag\*(R" below.
.PP
If the \f(CW$string\fR is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, then \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned.
.PP
\fIdecode\fR
.IX Subsection "decode"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $string = decode(ENCODING, OCTETS[, CHECK])
.Ve
.PP
This function returns the string that results from decoding the scalar
value \fI\s-1OCTETS\s0\fR, assumed to be a sequence of octets in \fI\s-1ENCODING\s0\fR, into
Perl's internal form.  The returns the resulting string.  As with \fIencode()\fR,
\&\fI\s-1ENCODING\s0\fR can be either a canonical name or an alias. For encoding names
and aliases, see \*(L"Defining Aliases\*(R"; for \fI\s-1CHECK\s0\fR, see \*(L"Handling
Malformed Data\*(R".
.PP
For example, to convert \s-1ISO\-8859\-1\s0 data into a string in Perl's
internal format:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $string = decode("iso\-8859\-1", $octets);
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB\s-1CAVEAT\s0\fR: When you run \f(CW\*(C`$string = decode("utf8", $octets)\*(C'\fR, then \f(CW$string\fR
\&\fImight not be equal to\fR \f(CW$octets\fR.  Though both contain the same data, the
\&\s-1UTF8\s0 flag for \f(CW$string\fR is on unless \f(CW$octets\fR consists entirely of \s-1ASCII\s0 data
on \s-1ASCII\s0 machines or \s-1EBCDIC\s0 on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 machines.  See \*(L"The \s-1UTF8\s0 flag\*(R"
below.
.PP
If the \f(CW$string\fR is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, then \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned.
.PP
\fIfind_encoding\fR
.IX Subsection "find_encoding"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  [$obj =] find_encoding(ENCODING)
.Ve
.PP
Returns the \fIencoding object\fR corresponding to \fI\s-1ENCODING\s0\fR.  Returns
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if no matching \fI\s-1ENCODING\s0\fR is find.  The returned object is
what does the actual encoding or decoding.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $utf8 = decode($name, $bytes);
.Ve
.PP
is in fact
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    $utf8 = do {
\&        $obj = find_encoding($name);
\&        croak qq(encoding "$name" not found) unless ref $obj;
\&        $obj\->decode($bytes);
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
with more error checking.
.PP
You can therefore save time by reusing this object as follows;
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    my $enc = find_encoding("iso\-8859\-1");
\&    while(<>) {
\&        my $utf8 = $enc\->decode($_);
\&        ... # now do something with $utf8;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Besides \*(L"decode\*(R" and \*(L"encode\*(R", other methods are
available as well.  For instance, \f(CW\*(C`name()\*(C'\fR returns the canonical
name of the encoding object.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  find_encoding("latin1")\->name; # iso\-8859\-1
.Ve
.PP
See Encode::Encoding for details.
.PP
\fIfrom_to\fR
.IX Subsection "from_to"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  [$length =] from_to($octets, FROM_ENC, TO_ENC [, CHECK])
.Ve
.PP
Converts \fIin-place\fR data between two encodings. The data in \f(CW$octets\fR
must be encoded as octets and \fInot\fR as characters in Perl's internal
format. For example, to convert \s-1ISO\-8859\-1\s0 data into Microsoft's \s-1CP1250\s0
encoding:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  from_to($octets, "iso\-8859\-1", "cp1250");
.Ve
.PP
and to convert it back:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  from_to($octets, "cp1250", "iso\-8859\-1");
.Ve
.PP
Because the conversion happens in place, the data to be
converted cannot be a string constant: it must be a scalar variable.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`from_to()\*(C'\fR returns the length of the converted string in octets on success,
and \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on error.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1CAVEAT\s0\fR: The following operations may look the same, but are not:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  from_to($data, "iso\-8859\-1", "utf8"); #1
\&  $data = decode("iso\-8859\-1", $data);  #2
.Ve
.PP
Both #1 and #2 make \f(CW$data\fR consist of a completely valid \s-1UTF\-8\s0 string,
but only #2 turns the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag on.  #1 is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $data = encode("utf8", decode("iso\-8859\-1", $data));
.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"The \s-1UTF8\s0 flag\*(R" below.
.PP
Also note that:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  from_to($octets, $from, $to, $check);
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent t:o
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $octets = encode($to, decode($from, $octets), $check);
.Ve
.PP
Yes, it does \fInot\fR respect the \f(CW$check\fR during decoding.  It is
deliberately done that way.  If you need minute control, use \f(CW\*(C`decode\*(C'\fR
followed by \f(CW\*(C`encode\*(C'\fR as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $octets = encode($to, decode($from, $octets, $check_from), $check_to);
.Ve
.PP
\fIencode_utf8\fR
.IX Subsection "encode_utf8"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $octets = encode_utf8($string);
.Ve
.PP
Equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`$octets = encode("utf8", $string)\*(C'\fR.  The characters in
\&\f(CW$string\fR are encoded in Perl's internal format, and the result is returned
as a sequence of octets.  Because all possible characters in Perl have a
(loose, not strict) \s-1UTF\-8\s0 representation, this function cannot fail.
.PP
\fIdecode_utf8\fR
.IX Subsection "decode_utf8"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $string = decode_utf8($octets [, CHECK]);
.Ve
.PP
Equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`$string = decode("utf8", $octets [, CHECK])\*(C'\fR.
The sequence of octets represented by \f(CW$octets\fR is decoded
from \s-1UTF\-8\s0 into a sequence of logical characters.
Because not all sequences of octets are valid \s-1UTF\-8,\s0
it is quite possible for this function to fail.
For \s-1CHECK,\s0 see \*(L"Handling Malformed Data\*(R".
.SS "Listing available encodings"
.IX Subsection "Listing available encodings"
.Vb 2
\&  use Encode;
\&  @list = Encode\->encodings();
.Ve
.PP
Returns a list of canonical names of available encodings that have already
been loaded.  To get a list of all available encodings including those that
have not yet been loaded, say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @all_encodings = Encode\->encodings(":all");
.Ve
.PP
Or you can give the name of a specific module:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @with_jp = Encode\->encodings("Encode::JP");
.Ve
.PP
When "\f(CW\*(C`::\*(C'\fR\*(L" is not in the name, \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`Encode::\*(C'\fR" is assumed.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @ebcdic = Encode\->encodings("EBCDIC");
.Ve
.PP
To find out in detail which encodings are supported by this package,
see Encode::Supported.
.SS "Defining Aliases"
.IX Subsection "Defining Aliases"
To add a new alias to a given encoding, use:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  use Encode;
\&  use Encode::Alias;
\&  define_alias(NEWNAME => ENCODING);
.Ve
.PP
After that, \fI\s-1NEWNAME\s0\fR can be used as an alias for \fI\s-1ENCODING\s0\fR.
\&\fI\s-1ENCODING\s0\fR may be either the name of an encoding or an
\&\fIencoding object\fR.
.PP
Before you do that, first make sure the alias is nonexistent using
\&\f(CW\*(C`resolve_alias()\*(C'\fR, which returns the canonical name thereof.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  Encode::resolve_alias("latin1") eq "iso\-8859\-1" # true
\&  Encode::resolve_alias("iso\-8859\-12")   # false; nonexistent
\&  Encode::resolve_alias($name) eq $name  # true if $name is canonical
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`resolve_alias()\*(C'\fR does not need \f(CW\*(C`use Encode::Alias\*(C'\fR; it can be
imported via \f(CW\*(C`use Encode qw(resolve_alias)\*(C'\fR.
.PP
See Encode::Alias for details.
.SS "Finding \s-1IANA\s0 Character Set Registry names"
.IX Subsection "Finding IANA Character Set Registry names"
The canonical name of a given encoding does not necessarily agree with
\&\s-1IANA\s0 Character Set Registry, commonly seen as \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Type:
text/plain; charset=\f(CIWHATEVER\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  For most cases, the canonical name
works, but sometimes it does not, most notably with \*(L"utf\-8\-strict\*(R".
.PP
As of \f(CW\*(C`Encode\*(C'\fR version 2.21, a new method \f(CW\*(C`mime_name()\*(C'\fR is therefore added.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  use Encode;
\&  my $enc = find_encoding("UTF\-8");
\&  warn $enc\->name;      # utf\-8\-strict
\&  warn $enc\->mime_name; # UTF\-8
.Ve
.PP

.SH "Encoding via PerlIO"
.IX Header "Encoding via PerlIO"
If your perl supports \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO\*(C'\fR (which is the default), you can use a
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO\*(C'\fR layer to decode and encode directly via a filehandle.  The
following two examples are fully identical in functionality:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  ### Version 1 via PerlIO
\&    open(INPUT,  "< :encoding(shiftjis)", $infile)
\&        || die "Can\*(Aqt open < $infile for reading: $!";
\&    open(OUTPUT, "> :encoding(euc\-jp)",  $outfile)
\&        || die "Can\*(Aqt open > $output for writing: $!";
\&    while (<INPUT>) {   # auto decodes $_
\&        print OUTPUT;   # auto encodes $_
\&    }
\&    close(INPUT)   || die "can\*(Aqt close $infile: $!";
\&    close(OUTPUT)  || die "can\*(Aqt close $outfile: $!";
\&
\&  ### Version 2 via from_to()

\&
\&    while (<INPUT>) {
\&        from_to($_, "shiftjis", "euc\-jp", 1);  # switch encoding
\&        print OUTPUT;   # emit raw (but properly encoded) data
\&    }
\&    close(INPUT)   || die "can\*(Aqt close $infile: $!";
\&    close(OUTPUT)  || die "can\*(Aqt close $outfile: $!";
.Ve
.PP
In the first version above, you let the appropriate encoding layer
handle the conversion.  In the second, you explicitly translate
from one encoding to the other.
.PP
Unfortunately, it may be that encodings are \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO\*(C'\fR\-savvy.  You can check
to see whether your encoding is supported by \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO\*(C'\fR by invoking the
\&\f(CW\*(C`perlio_ok\*(C'\fR method on it:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  Encode::perlio_ok("hz");             # false
\&  find_encoding("euc\-cn")\->perlio_ok;  # true wherever PerlIO is available
\&
\&  use Encode qw(perlio_ok);            # imported upon request
\&  perlio_ok("euc\-jp")
.Ve
.PP
Fortunately, all encodings that come with \f(CW\*(C`Encode\*(C'\fR core are \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO\*(C'\fR\-savvy
except for \f(CW\*(C`hz\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ISO\-2022\-kr\*(C'\fR.  For the gory details, see
Encode::Encoding and Encode::PerlIO.
.SH "Handling Malformed Data"

If \fI\s-1CHECK\s0\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`Encode::FB_QUIET\*(C'\fR, encoding and decoding immediately
return the portion of the data that has been processed so far when an
error occurs. The data argument is overwritten with everything
after that point; that is, the unprocessed portion of the data.  This is
handy when you have to call \f(CW\*(C`decode\*(C'\fR repeatedly in the case where your
source data may contain partial multi-byte character sequences,
(that is, you are reading with a fixed-width buffer). Here's some sample
code to do exactly that:
.PP

Before the introduction of Unicode support in Perl, The \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR operator
just compared the strings represented by two scalars. Beginning with
Perl 5.8, \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR compares two strings with simultaneous consideration of
\&\fIthe \s-1UTF8\s0 flag\fR. To explain why we made it so, I quote from page 402 of
\&\fIProgramming Perl, 3rd ed.\fR

.IX Item "Goal #1:"
Old byte-oriented programs should not spontaneously break on the old
byte-oriented data they used to work on.

Old byte-oriented programs should magically start working on the new
character-oriented data when appropriate.

as in the old byte-oriented mode.
.IP "Goal #4:" 2
.IX Item "Goal #4:"
Perl should remain one language, rather than forking into a
byte-oriented Perl and a character-oriented Perl.
.PP
When \fIProgramming Perl, 3rd ed.\fR was written, not even Perl 5.6.0 had been
born yet, many features documented in the book remained unimplemented for a
long time.  Perl 5.8 corrected much of this, and the introduction of the
\&\s-1UTF8\s0 flag is one of them.  You can think of there being two fundamentally
different kinds of strings and string-operations in Perl: one a
byte-oriented mode  for when the internal \s-1UTF8\s0 flag is off, and the other a
character-oriented mode for when the internal \s-1UTF8\s0 flag is on.
.PP
Here is how \f(CW\*(C`Encode\*(C'\fR handles the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag.
.IP "\(bu" 2
When you \fIencode\fR, the resulting \s-1UTF8\s0 flag is always \fBoff\fR.

unambiguously represent data.  Here is what we mean by \*(L"unambiguously\*(R".
After \f(CW\*(C`$utf8 = decode("foo", $octet)\*(C'\fR,
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  When $octet is...   The UTF8 flag in $utf8 is

As you see, there is one exception: in \s-1ASCII. \s0 That way you can assume
Goal #1.  And with \f(CW\*(C`Encode\*(C'\fR, Goal #2 is assumed but you still have to be
careful in the cases mentioned in the \fB\s-1CAVEAT\s0\fR paragraphs above.
.Sp
This \s-1UTF8\s0 flag is not visible in Perl scripts, exactly for the same reason
you cannot (or rather, you \fIdon't have to\fR) see whether a scalar contains
a string, an integer, or a floating-point number.   But you can still peek
and poke these if you will.  See the next section.

stricter than that. For example, its range is much narrower (0 .. 0x10_FFFF
to cover only 21 bits instead of 32 or 64 bits) and some sequences
are not allowed, like those used in surrogate pairs, the 31 non-character
code points 0xFDD0 .. 0xFDEF, the last two code points in \fIany\fR plane

Got that?  As of Perl 5.8.7, \fB\*(L"\s-1UTF\-8\*(R"\s0\fR means \s-1UTF\-8\s0 in its current

lax.  \f(CW\*(C`Encode\*(C'\fR version 2.10 or later thus groks this subtle but critically
important distinction between \f(CW"UTF\-8"\fR and \f(CW"utf8"\fR.

critical; without it, \f(CW\*(C`Encode\*(C'\fR goes \*(L"liberal\*(R" and (perhaps overly\-)permissive:

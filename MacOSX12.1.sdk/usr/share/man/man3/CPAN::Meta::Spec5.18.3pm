.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes version 2 of the \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution metadata
specification, also known as the \*(L"\s-1CPAN\s0 Meta Spec\*(R".
.PP
Revisions of this specification for typo corrections and prose
clarifications may be issued as CPAN::Meta::Spec 2.\fIx\fR.  These
revisions will never change semantics or add or remove specified
behavior.
.PP
Distribution metadata describe important properties of Perl
distributions. Distribution building tools like Module::Build,
Module::Install, ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Dist::Zilla should create a
metadata file in accordance with this specification and include it with
the distribution for use by automated tools that index, examine, package
or install Perl distributions.
.SH "TERMINOLOGY"
.IX Header "TERMINOLOGY"
.IP "distribution" 4
.IX Item "distribution"
This is the primary object described by the metadata. In the context of
this document it usually refers to a collection of modules, scripts,
and/or documents that are distributed together for other developers to
use.  Examples of distributions are \f(CW\*(C`Class\-Container\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`libwww\-perl\*(C'\fR,
or \f(CW\*(C`DBI\*(C'\fR.
.IP "module" 4
.IX Item "module"
This refers to a reusable library of code contained in a single file.
Modules usually contain one or more packages and are often referred
to by the name of a primary package that can be mapped to the file
name. For example, one might refer to \f(CW\*(C`File::Spec\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\fIFile/Spec.pm\fR
.IP "package" 4
.IX Item "package"
This refers to a namespace declared with the Perl \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR statement.
In Perl, packages often have a version number property given by the
\&\f(CW$VERSION\fR variable in the namespace.
.IP "consumer" 4
.IX Item "consumer"
This refers to code that reads a metadata file, deserializes it into a
data structure in memory, or interprets a data structure of metadata
elements.
.IP "producer" 4
.IX Item "producer"
This refers to code that constructs a metadata data structure,
serializes into a bytestream and/or writes it to disk.
.IP "must, should, may, etc." 4
.IX Item "must, should, may, etc."
These terms are interpreted as described in \s-1IETF RFC 2119.\s0
.SH "DATA TYPES"
.IX Header "DATA TYPES"
Fields in the \*(L"\s-1STRUCTURE\*(R"\s0 section describe data elements, each of
which has an associated data type as described herein.  There are four
primitive types: Boolean, String, List and Map.  Other types are
subtypes of primitives and define compound data structures or define
constraints on the values of a data element.
.SS "Boolean"
.IX Subsection "Boolean"
A \fIBoolean\fR is used to provide a true or false value.  It \fBmust\fR be
represented as a defined value.
.SS "String"
.IX Subsection "String"
A \fIString\fR is data element containing a non-zero length sequence of
Unicode characters, such as an ordinary Perl scalar that is not a
reference.
.SS "List"
.IX Subsection "List"
A \fIList\fR is an ordered collection of zero or more data elements.
Elements of a List may be of mixed types.
.PP
Producers \fBmust\fR represent List elements using a data structure which
unambiguously indicates that multiple values are possible, such as a
reference to a Perl array (an \*(L"arrayref\*(R").
.PP
Consumers expecting a List \fBmust\fR consider a String as equivalent to a
List of length 1.
.SS "Map"
.IX Subsection "Map"
A \fIMap\fR is an unordered collection of zero or more data elements
(\*(L"values\*(R"), indexed by associated String elements (\*(L"keys\*(R").  The Map's
value elements may be of mixed types.
.SS "License String"
.IX Subsection "License String"
A \fILicense String\fR is a subtype of String with a restricted set of
values.  Valid values are described in detail in the description of
the \*(L"license\*(R" field.
.SS "\s-1URL\s0"
.IX Subsection "URL"
\&\fI\s-1URL\s0\fR is a subtype of String containing a Uniform Resource Locator or
Identifier.  [ This type is called \s-1URL\s0 and not \s-1URI\s0 for historical reasons. ]
.SS "Version"
.IX Subsection "Version"
A \fIVersion\fR is a subtype of String containing a value that describes
the version number of packages or distributions.  Restrictions on format
are described in detail in the \*(L"Version Formats\*(R" section.
.SS "Version Range"
.IX Subsection "Version Range"
The \fIVersion Range\fR type is a subtype of String.  It describes a range
of Versions that may be present or installed to fulfill prerequisites.
It is specified in detail in the \*(L"Version Ranges\*(R" section.
.SH "STRUCTURE"
.IX Header "STRUCTURE"
The metadata structure is a data element of type Map.  This section
describes valid keys within the Map.
.PP
Any keys not described in this specification document (whether top-level
or within compound data structures described herein) are considered
\&\fIcustom keys\fR and \fBmust\fR begin with an \*(L"x\*(R" or \*(L"X\*(R" and be followed by an
underscore; i.e. they must match the pattern: \f(CW\*(C`qr{\eAx_}i\*(C'\fR.  If a
custom key refers to a compound data structure, subkeys within it do not
need an \*(L"x_\*(R" or \*(L"X_\*(R" prefix.
.PP
Consumers of metadata may ignore any or all custom keys.  All other keys
not described herein are invalid and should be ignored by consumers.
Producers must not generate or output invalid keys.
.PP
For each key, an example is provided followed by a description.  The
description begins with the version of spec in which the key was added
or in which the definition was modified, whether the key is \fIrequired\fR
or \fIoptional\fR and the data type of the corresponding data element.
These items are in parentheses, brackets and braces, respectively.
.PP
If a data type is a Map or Map subtype, valid subkeys will be described
as well.
.PP
Some fields are marked \fIDeprecated\fR.  These are shown for historical
context and must not be produced in or consumed from any metadata structure
of version 2 or higher.
.SS "\s-1REQUIRED FIELDS\s0"
.IX Subsection "REQUIRED FIELDS"
\fIabstract\fR
.IX Subsection "abstract"
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  abstract => \*(AqBuild and install Perl modules\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
(Spec 1.2) [required] {String}
.PP
This is a short description of the purpose of the distribution.
.PP
\fIauthor\fR

.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  author => [ \*(AqKen Williams <kwilliams@cpan.org>\*(Aq ]
.Ve
.PP
(Spec 1.2) [required] {List of one or more Strings}
.PP
This List indicates the person(s) to contact concerning the
distribution. The preferred form of the contact string is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  contact\-name <email\-address>
.Ve
.PP
This field provides a general contact list independent of other
structured fields provided within the \*(L"resources\*(R" field, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`bugtracker\*(C'\fR.  The addressee(s) can be contacted for any purpose
including but not limited to (security) problems with the distribution,
questions about the distribution or bugs in the distribution.
.PP
A distribution's original author is usually the contact listed within
this field.  Co-maintainers, successor maintainers or mailing lists
devoted to the distribution may also be listed in addition to or instead
of the original author.
.PP
\fIdynamic_config\fR
.IX Subsection "dynamic_config"
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  dynamic_config => 1
.Ve
.PP
(Spec 2) [required] {Boolean}
.PP
A boolean flag indicating whether a \fIBuild.PL\fR or \fIMakefile.PL\fR (or
similar) must be executed to determine prerequisites.
.PP
This field should be set to a true value if the distribution performs
some dynamic configuration (asking questions, sensing the environment,
etc.) as part of its configuration.  This field should be set to a false
value to indicate that prerequisites included in metadata may be
considered final and valid for static analysis.
.PP
This field explicitly \fBdoes not\fR indicate whether installation may be
safely performed without using a Makefile or Build file, as there may be
special files to install or custom installation targets (e.g. for
dual-life modules that exist on \s-1CPAN\s0 as well as in the Perl core).  This
field only defines whether prerequisites are complete as given in the
metadata.
.PP
\fIgenerated_by\fR
.IX Subsection "generated_by"
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  generated_by => \*(AqModule::Build version 0.36\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
(Spec 1.0) [required] {String}
.PP
This field indicates the tool that was used to create this metadata.
There are no defined semantics for this field, but it is traditional to
use a string in the form \*(L"Generating::Package version 1.23\*(R" or the
author's name, if the file was generated by hand.
.PP
\fIlicense\fR
.IX Subsection "license"
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  license => [ \*(Aqperl_5\*(Aq ]
\&

.PP
(Spec 1.2) [required] {Map}
.PP
This field indicates the version of the \s-1CPAN\s0 Meta Spec that should be
used to interpret the metadata.  Consumers must check this key as soon
as possible and abort further metadata processing if the meta-spec
version is not supported by the consumer.
.PP
The following keys are valid, but only \f(CW\*(C`version\*(C'\fR is required.
.IP "version" 4
.IX Item "version"
This subkey gives the integer \fIVersion\fR of the \s-1CPAN\s0 Meta Spec against
which the document was generated.
.IP "url" 4
.IX Item "url"
This is a \fI\s-1URL\s0\fR of the metadata specification document corresponding to

Consumers \fBmust not\fR include optional features as prerequisites without
explicit instruction from users (whether via interactive prompting,

If an optional feature is used by a consumer to add additional

\&\fISuggestion for disuse:\fR Because there is currently no way for a
distribution to specify a dependency on an optional feature of another

create a separate, installable distribution that ensures the desired

.SS "Version Ranges"
.IX Subsection "Version Ranges"
Some fields (prereq, optional_features) indicate the particular
version(s) of some other module that may be required as a prerequisite.
This section details the Version Range type used to provide this
information.
.PP
The simplest format for a Version Range is just the version
number itself, e.g. \f(CW2.4\fR.  This means that \fBat least\fR version 2.4
must be present.  To indicate that \fBany\fR version of a prerequisite is
okay, even if the prerequisite doesn't define a version at all, use
the version \f(CW0\fR.
.PP
Alternatively, a version range \fBmay\fR use the operators < (less than),
<= (less than or equal), > (greater than), >= (greater than
or equal), == (equal), and != (not equal).  For example, the
specification \f(CW\*(C`< 2.0\*(C'\fR means that any version of the prerequisite
less than 2.0 is suitable.
.PP
For more complicated situations, version specifications \fBmay\fR be AND-ed
together using commas.  The specification \f(CW\*(C`>= 1.2, != 1.5, <
2.0\*(C'\fR indicates a version that must be \fBat least\fR 1.2, \fBless than\fR 2.0,
and \fBnot equal to\fR 1.5.
.SH "PREREQUISITES"
.IX Header "PREREQUISITES"
.SS "Prereq Spec"
.IX Subsection "Prereq Spec"
The \f(CW\*(C`prereqs\*(C'\fR key in the top-level metadata and within
\&\f(CW\*(C`optional_features\*(C'\fR define the relationship between a distribution and
other packages.  The prereq spec structure is a hierarchical data
structure which divides prerequisites into \fIPhases\fR of activity in the
installation process and \fIRelationships\fR that indicate how
prerequisites should be resolved.
.PP
For example, to specify that \f(CW\*(C`Data::Dumper\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`required\*(C'\fR during the

Requirements for regular use must be listed in the \f(CW\*(C`runtime\*(C'\fR phase.

The build phase is when the distribution's source code is compiled (if

The develop phase's prereqs are libraries needed to work on the

needed to build a release tarball, to run author-only tests, or to
perform other tasks related to developing new versions of the
distribution.

.IP "conflicts" 4
.IX Item "conflicts"
These libraries cannot be installed when the phase is in operation.

.SS "Merging and Resolving Prerequisites"
.IX Subsection "Merging and Resolving Prerequisites"
Whenever metadata consumers merge prerequisites, either from different
phases or from \f(CW\*(C`optional_features\*(C'\fR, they should merged in a way which
preserves the intended semantics of the prerequisite structure.  Generally,
this means concatenating the version specifications using commas, as
described in the \*(L"Version Ranges\*(R" section.
.PP
Another subtle error that can occur in resolving prerequisites comes from
the way that modules in prerequisites are indexed to distribution files on
\&\s-1CPAN. \s0 When a module is deleted from a distribution, prerequisites calling
for that module could indicate an older distribution should be installed,
potentially overwriting files from a newer distribution.
.PP
For example, as of Oct 31, 2009, the \s-1CPAN\s0 index file contained these
module-distribution mappings:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  Class::MOP                   0.94  D/DR/DROLSKY/Class\-MOP\-0.94.tar.gz
\&  Class::MOP::Class            0.94  D/DR/DROLSKY/Class\-MOP\-0.94.tar.gz
\&  Class::MOP::Class::Immutable 0.04  S/ST/STEVAN/Class\-MOP\-0.36.tar.gz
.Ve
.PP
Consider the case where \*(L"Class::MOP\*(R" 0.94 is installed.  If a
distribution specified \*(L"Class::MOP::Class::Immutable\*(R" as a prerequisite,
it could result in Class\-MOP\-0.36.tar.gz being installed, overwriting
any files from Class\-MOP\-0.94.tar.gz.
.PP
Consumers of metadata \fBshould\fR test whether prerequisites would result
in installed module files being \*(L"downgraded\*(R" to an older version and
\&\fBmay\fR warn users or ignore the prerequisite that would cause such a
result.
.SH "SERIALIZATION"
.IX Header "SERIALIZATION"
Distribution metadata should be serialized (as a hashref) as
JSON-encoded data and packaged with distributions as the file
\&\fI\s-1META\s0.json\fR.
.PP
In the past, the distribution metadata structure had been packed with
distributions as \fI\s-1META\s0.yml\fR, a file in the \s-1YAML\s0 Tiny format (for which,
see YAML::Tiny).  Tools that consume distribution metadata from disk
should be capable of loading \fI\s-1META\s0.yml\fR, but should prefer \fI\s-1META\s0.json\fR
if both are found.
.SH "NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTORS"
.IX Header "NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTORS"
.SS "Extracting Version Numbers from Perl Modules"
.IX Subsection "Extracting Version Numbers from Perl Modules"
To get the version number from a Perl module, consumers should use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`MM\->parse_version($file)\*(C'\fR method provided by
ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Metadata.  For example, for the
module given by \f(CW$mod\fR, the version may be retrieved in one of the
following ways:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  # via ExtUtils::MakeMaker
\&  my $file = MM\->_installed_file_for_module($mod);
\&  my $version = MM\->parse_version($file)
.Ve
.PP
The private \f(CW\*(C`_installed_file_for_module\*(C'\fR method may be replaced with
other methods for locating a module in \f(CW@INC\fR.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  # via Module::Metadata
\&  my $info = Module::Metadata\->new_from_module($mod);
\&  my $version = $info\->version;
.Ve
.PP
If only a filename is available, the following approach may be used:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  # via Module::Build
\&  my $info = Module::Metadata\->new_from_file($file);
\&  my $version = $info\->version;
.Ve
.SS "Comparing Version Numbers"
.IX Subsection "Comparing Version Numbers"
The version module provides the most reliable way to compare version
numbers in all the various ways they might be provided or might exist
within modules.  Given two strings containing version numbers, \f(CW$v1\fR and
\&\f(CW$v2\fR, they should be converted to \f(CW\*(C`version\*(C'\fR objects before using
ordinary comparison operators.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  use version;
\&  if ( version\->new($v1) <=> version\->new($v2) ) {
\&    print "Versions are not equal\en";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
If the only comparison needed is whether an installed module is of a
sufficiently high version, a direct test may be done using the string
form of \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR function.  For example, for module \f(CW$mod\fR
and version prerequisite \f(CW$prereq\fR:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  if ( eval "use $mod $prereq (); 1" ) {
\&    print "Module $mod version is OK.\en";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
If the values of \f(CW$mod\fR and \f(CW$prereq\fR have not been scrubbed, however,
this presents security implications.

Ken Williams wrote the original \s-1CPAN\s0 Meta Spec (also known as the
\&\*(L"\s-1META\s0.yml spec\*(R") in 2003 and maintained it through several revisions
with input from various members of the community.  In 2005, Randy
Sims redrafted it from \s-1HTML\s0 to \s-1POD\s0 for the version 1.2 release.  Ken
continued to maintain the spec through version 1.4.
.PP
In late 2009, David Golden organized the version 2 proposal review
process.  David and Ricardo Signes drafted the final version 2 spec
in April 2010 based on the version 1.4 spec and patches contributed
during the proposal process.

.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBMPSImageLaplacian\fP is an optimized variant of the \fBMPSImageConvolution\fP filter provided primarily for ease of use\&. This filter uses an optimized convolution filter with a 3 x 3 kernel with the following weights: [ 0 1 0 1 -4 1 0 1 0 ]
.PP
The optimized convolution filter used by \fBMPSImageLaplacian\fP can also be used by creating a \fBMPSImageConvolution\fP object with kernelWidth = 3, kernelHeight = 3 and weights as specified above\&.

The bias is a value to be added to convolved pixel before it is converted back to the storage format\&. It can be used to convert negative values into a representable range for a unsigned MTLPixelFormat\&. For example, many edge detection filters produce results in the range [-k,k]\&. By scaling the filter weights by 0\&.5/k and adding 0\&.5, the results will be in range [0,1] suitable for use with unorm formats\&. It can be used in combination with renormalization of the filter weights to do video ranging as part of the convolution effect\&. It can also just be used to increase the brightness of the image\&.

Default value is 0\&.0f\&.

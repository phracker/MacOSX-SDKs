.SH NAME
.B "glGetClipPlane
\- return the coefficients of the specified clipping plane

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glGetClipPlane\fP(
GLenum \fIplane\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3void \fPglGetClipPlane( 'u
	GLdouble \fI*equation\fP )
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIequation\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2plane\fP
Specifies a clipping plane.
The number of clipping planes depends on the implementation,
but at least six clipping planes are supported.
They are identified by symbolic names of the form \%\f3GL_CLIP_PLANE\fPi
where 0 \(<=  i  < \%\f3GL_MAX_CLIP_PLANES\fP.
.TP
\f2equation\fP
Returns four double-precision values that are the coefficients of the plane equation of \f2plane\fP in eye coordinates.
The initial value is (0, 0, 0, 0).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glGetClipPlane\fP returns in \f2equation\fP the four coefficients of the plane equation
for \f2plane\fP.
.SH NOTES
It is always the case that \%\f3GL_CLIP_PLANE\fPi = \%\f3GL_CLIP_PLANE0\fP + i.
.P
If an error is generated,
no change is made to the contents of \f2equation\fP.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2plane\fP is not an accepted value.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glGetClipPlane\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.

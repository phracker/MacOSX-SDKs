.Sh DESCRIPTION
These macros operate on strings of bits.
.Pp
The macro
.Fn bit_alloc
returns a pointer of type
.Dq Fa "bitstr_t *"
to sufficient space to store
.Fa nbits
bits, or
.Dv NULL
if no space is available.
.Pp
The macro
.Fn bit_decl
allocates sufficient space to store
.Fa nbits
bits on the stack.
.Pp
The macro
.Fn bitstr_size
returns the number of elements of type
.Fa bitstr_t
necessary to store
.Fa nbits
bits.
This is useful for copying bit strings.
.Pp
The macros
.Fn bit_clear
and
.Fn bit_set
clear or set the zero-based numbered bit
.Fa bit ,
in the bit string
.Ar name .
.Pp
The
.Fn bit_nset
and
.Fn bit_nclear
macros
set or clear the zero-based numbered bits from
.Fa start
to
.Fa stop
in the bit string
.Ar name .
.Pp
The
.Fn bit_test
macro
evaluates to non-zero if the zero-based numbered bit
.Fa bit
of bit string
.Fa name
is set, and zero otherwise.
.Pp
The
.Fn bit_ffs
macro
stores in the location referenced by
.Fa value
the zero-based number of the first bit set in the array of
.Fa nbits
bits referenced by
.Fa name .
If no bits are set, the location referenced by
.Fa value
is set to \-1.
.Pp
The macro
.Fn bit_ffc
stores in the location referenced by
.Fa value
the zero-based number of the first bit not set in the array of
.Fa nbits
bits referenced by
.Fa name .
If all bits are set, the location referenced by
.Fa value
is set to \-1.
.Pp
The macros
.Fn bit_clear ,
.Fn bit_set
and
.Fn bit_test
will evaluate the
.Fa bit
argument more than once, so avoid using pre- or post-, increment or decrement.
The arguments to the other macros are evaluated only once and may safely
have side effects.

.Sh NAME
.Nm acos
.Nd arc cosine function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn acos "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn acosl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn acosf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acos
function computes the principle value of the arc cosine of
.Fa x .
The result is in the range
.Bq 0 , \*(Pi .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn acos "1"
returns +0.
.Pp
.Fn acos "x"
returns a NAN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception for |x| > 1.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn acos
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vacosf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvacosf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvacos "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;

.Vb 2
\&  use DateTime;
\&  use DateTime::TimeZone;
\&
\&  my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone\->new( name => \*(AqAmerica/Chicago\*(Aq );
\&
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->now();
\&  my $offset = $tz\->offset_for_datetime($dt);
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This class is the base class for all time zone objects.  A time zone
is represented internally as a set of observances, each of which
describes the offset from \s-1GMT\s0 for a given time period.
.PP
Note that without the DateTime module, this module does not do
much.  It's primary interface is through a DateTime object, and
most users will not need to directly use \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\*(C'\fR
methods.
.SS "Special Case Platforms"
.IX Subsection "Special Case Platforms"
If you are on the Win32 platform, you will want to also install
DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32. This will enable you to specify a time
zone of \f(CW\*(Aqlocal\*(Aq\fR when creating a DateTime object.
.PP
If you are on \s-1HPUX,\s0 install DateTime::TimeZone::HPUX. This provides support
for \s-1HPUX\s0 style time zones like \f(CW\*(AqMET\-1METDST\*(Aq\fR.
.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
This class has the following methods:
.ie n .SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->new( name => $tz_name )"
.el .SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->new( name => \f(CW$tz_name\fP )"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::TimeZone->new( name => $tz_name )"
Given a valid time zone name, this method returns a new time zone
blessed into the appropriate subclass.  Subclasses are named for the
given time zone, so that the time zone \*(L"America/Chicago\*(R" is the
DateTime::TimeZone::America::Chicago class.
.PP
If the name given is a \*(L"link\*(R" name in the Olson database, the object
created may have a different name.  For example, there is a link from
the old \*(L"\s-1EST5EDT\*(R"\s0 name to \*(L"America/New_York\*(R".
.PP
When loading a time zone from the Olson database, the constructor
checks the version of the loaded class to make sure it matches the
version of the current DateTime::TimeZone installation. If they do not
match it will issue a warning. This is useful because time zone names
may fall out of use, but you may have an old module file installed for
that time zone.
.PP
There are also several special values that can be given as names.
.PP
If the \*(L"name\*(R" parameter is \*(L"floating\*(R", then a \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone::Floating\*(C'\fR
object is returned.  A floating time zone does not have \fIany\fR offset, and is
always the same time.  This is useful for calendaring applications, which may
need to specify that a given event happens at the same \fIlocal\fR time,
regardless of where it occurs. See \s-1RFC
2445\s0 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt> for more details.
.PP
If the \*(L"name\*(R" parameter is \*(L"\s-1UTC\*(R",\s0 then a \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone::UTC\*(C'\fR
object is returned.
.PP
If the \*(L"name\*(R" is an offset string, it is converted to a number, and a
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly\*(C'\fR object is returned.
.PP
\fIThe \*(L"local\*(R" time zone\fR
.IX Subsection "The local time zone"
.PP
If the \*(L"name\*(R" parameter is \*(L"local\*(R", then the module attempts to
determine the local time zone for the system.
.PP
The method for finding the local zone varies by operating system. See
the appropriate module for details of how we check for the local time
zone.

.PP
If a local time zone is not found, then an exception will be thrown. This
exception will always stringify to something containing the text \f(CW"Cannot
determine local time zone"\fR.
.PP
If you are writing code for users to run on systems you do not control, you
should try to account for the possibility that this exception may be
thrown. Falling back to \s-1UTC\s0 might be a reasonable alternative.
.PP
When writing tests for your modules that might be run on others' systems, you
are strongly encouraged to either not use \f(CW\*(C`local\*(C'\fR when creating DateTime
objects or to set \f(CW$ENV{TZ}\fR to a known value in your test code. All of the
per-OS classes check this environment variable.
.ie n .SS "$tz\->offset_for_datetime( $dt )"
.el .SS "\f(CW$tz\fP\->offset_for_datetime( \f(CW$dt\fP )"
.IX Subsection "$tz->offset_for_datetime( $dt )"
Given a \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR object, this method returns the offset in seconds
for the given datetime.  This takes into account historical time zone
information, as well as Daylight Saving Time.  The offset is
determined by looking at the object's \s-1UTC\s0 Rata Die days and seconds.
.ie n .SS "$tz\->offset_for_local_datetime( $dt )"
.el .SS "\f(CW$tz\fP\->offset_for_local_datetime( \f(CW$dt\fP )"
.IX Subsection "$tz->offset_for_local_datetime( $dt )"
Given a \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR object, this method returns the offset in seconds
for the given datetime.  Unlike the previous method, this method uses
the local time's Rata Die days and seconds.  This should only be done
when the corresponding \s-1UTC\s0 time is not yet known, because local times
can be ambiguous due to Daylight Saving Time rules.
.ie n .SS "$tz\->is_dst_for_datetime( $dt )"
.el .SS "\f(CW$tz\fP\->is_dst_for_datetime( \f(CW$dt\fP )"
.IX Subsection "$tz->is_dst_for_datetime( $dt )"
Given a \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR object, this method returns true if the DateTime is
currently in Daylight Saving Time.
.ie n .SS "$tz\->name"
.el .SS "\f(CW$tz\fP\->name"
.IX Subsection "$tz->name"
Returns the name of the time zone.
.ie n .SS "$tz\->short_name_for_datetime( $dt )"
.el .SS "\f(CW$tz\fP\->short_name_for_datetime( \f(CW$dt\fP )"
.IX Subsection "$tz->short_name_for_datetime( $dt )"
Given a \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR object, this method returns the \*(L"short name\*(R" for
the current observance and rule this datetime is in.  These are names
like \*(L"\s-1EST\*(R", \*(L"GMT\*(R",\s0 etc.
.PP
It is \fBstrongly\fR recommended that you do not rely on these names for
anything other than display.  These names are not official, and many
of them are simply the invention of the Olson database maintainers.
Moreover, these names are not unique.  For example, there is an \*(L"\s-1EST\*(R"\s0
at both \-0500 and +1000/+1100.
.ie n .SS "$tz\->is_floating"
.el .SS "\f(CW$tz\fP\->is_floating"
.IX Subsection "$tz->is_floating"
Returns a boolean indicating whether or not this object represents a floating
time zone, as defined by \s-1RFC 2445\s0 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt>.
.ie n .SS "$tz\->is_utc"
.el .SS "\f(CW$tz\fP\->is_utc"
.IX Subsection "$tz->is_utc"
Indicates whether or not this object represents the \s-1UTC\s0 (\s-1GMT\s0) time
zone.
.ie n .SS "$tz\->has_dst_changes"
.el .SS "\f(CW$tz\fP\->has_dst_changes"
.IX Subsection "$tz->has_dst_changes"
Indicates whether or not this zone has \fIever\fR had a change to and
from \s-1DST,\s0 either in the past or future.
.ie n .SS "$tz\->is_olson"
.el .SS "\f(CW$tz\fP\->is_olson"
.IX Subsection "$tz->is_olson"
Returns true if the time zone is a named time zone from the Olson
database.
.ie n .SS "$tz\->category"
.el .SS "\f(CW$tz\fP\->category"
.IX Subsection "$tz->category"
Returns the part of the time zone name before the first slash.  For
example, the \*(L"America/Chicago\*(R" time zone would return \*(L"America\*(R".
.SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->is_valid_name($name)"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::TimeZone->is_valid_name($name)"
Given a string, this method returns a boolean value indicating whether
or not the string is a valid time zone name.  If you are using
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone::Alias\*(C'\fR, any aliases you've created will be valid.
.SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->all_names"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::TimeZone->all_names"
This returns a pre-sorted list of all the time zone names.  This list
does not include link names.  In scalar context, it returns an array
reference, while in list context it returns an array.
.SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->categories"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::TimeZone->categories"
This returns a list of all time zone categories.  In scalar context,
it returns an array reference, while in list context it returns an
array.
.SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->links"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::TimeZone->links"
This returns a hash of all time zone links, where the keys are the
old, deprecated names, and the values are the new names.  In scalar
context, it returns a hash reference, while in list context it returns
a hash.
.ie n .SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->names_in_category( $category )"
.el .SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->names_in_category( \f(CW$category\fP )"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::TimeZone->names_in_category( $category )"
Given a valid category, this method returns a list of the names in
that category, without the category portion.  So the list for the
\&\*(L"America\*(R" category would include the strings \*(L"Chicago\*(R",
\&\*(L"Kentucky/Monticello\*(R", and \*(L"New_York\*(R". In scalar context, it returns
an array reference, while in list context it returns an array.
.SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->\fBcountries()\fP"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::TimeZone->countries()"
Returns a sorted list of all the valid country codes (in lower-case)
which can be passed to \f(CW\*(C`names_in_country()\*(C'\fR. In scalar context, it
returns an array reference, while in list context it returns an array.
.PP
If you need to convert country codes to names or vice versa you can use
\&\f(CW\*(C`Locale::Country\*(C'\fR to do so. Note that one of the codes returned is \*(L"uk\*(R",
which is an alias for the country code \*(L"gb\*(R", and is not a valid \s-1ISO\s0 country
code.
.ie n .SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->names_in_country( $country_code )"
.el .SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->names_in_country( \f(CW$country_code\fP )"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::TimeZone->names_in_country( $country_code )"
Given a two-letter \s-1ISO3166\s0 country code, this method returns a list of
time zones used in that country. The country code may be of any
case. In scalar context, it returns an array reference, while in list
context it returns an array.
.PP
This list is returned in an order vaguely based on geography and
population. In general, the least used zones come last, but there are not
guarantees of a specific order from one release to the next. This order is
probably the best option for presenting zones names to end users.
.ie n .SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->offset_as_seconds( $offset )"
.el .SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->offset_as_seconds( \f(CW$offset\fP )"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::TimeZone->offset_as_seconds( $offset )"
Given an offset as a string, this returns the number of seconds
represented by the offset as a positive or negative number.  Returns
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if \f(CW$offset\fR is not in the range \f(CW\*(C`\-99:59:59\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`+99:59:59\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The offset is expected to match either
\&\f(CW\*(C`/^([\e+\e\-])?(\ed\ed?):(\ed\ed)(?::(\ed\ed))?$/\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`/^([\e+\e\-])?(\ed\ed)(\ed\ed)(\ed\ed)?$/\*(C'\fR.  If it doesn't match either of
these, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR will be returned.
.PP
This means that if you want to specify hours as a single digit, then
each element of the offset must be separated by a colon (:).
.ie n .SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->offset_as_string( $offset )"
.el .SS "DateTime::TimeZone\->offset_as_string( \f(CW$offset\fP )"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::TimeZone->offset_as_string( $offset )"
Given an offset as a number, this returns the offset as a string.
Returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if \f(CW$offset\fR is not in the range \f(CW\*(C`\-359999\*(C'\fR to \f(CW359999\fR.
.SS "Storable Hooks"
.IX Subsection "Storable Hooks"
This module provides freeze and thaw hooks for \f(CW\*(C`Storable\*(C'\fR so that the
huge data structures for Olson time zones are not actually stored in
the serialized structure.
.PP
If you subclass \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\*(C'\fR, you will inherit its hooks,
which may not work for your module, so please test the interaction of
your module with Storable.
.SH "LOADING TIME ZONES IN A PRE-FORKING SYSTEM"
.IX Header "LOADING TIME ZONES IN A PRE-FORKING SYSTEM"
If you are running an application that does pre-forking (for example with
Starman), then you should try to load all the time zones that you'll need in
the parent process. Time zones are loaded on-demand, so loading them once in
each child will waste memory that could otherwise be shared.

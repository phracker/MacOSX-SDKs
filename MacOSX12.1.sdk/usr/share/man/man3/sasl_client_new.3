.SH DESCRIPTION

.B sasl_client_new()
creates a new SASL context. This context will be used for all SASL calls for one connection. It handles both authentication and integrity/encryption layers after authentication.
.PP
.I service
is the registered name of the service (usually the protocol name) using SASL (e.g. "imap").
.PP
.I serverFQDN
is the fully qualified domain name of the server (e.g. "serverhost.cmu.edu").
.PP
.I iplocalport
is the IP and port of the local side of the connection, or NULL.  If
iplocalport is NULL it will disable mechanisms that require IP address
information.  This strings must be in one of the following formats:
"a.b.c.d;port" (IPv4), "e:f:g:h:i:j:k:l;port" (IPv6),
or "e:f:g:h:i:j:a.b.c.d;port" (IPv6)
.PP
.I ipremoteport
is the IP and port of the remote side of the connection, or NULL (see
iplocalport)
.PP
.I prompt_supp
is a list of client interactions supported that is unique to this connection. If this parameter is NULL the global callbacks (specified in sasl_client_init) will be used. See sasl_callback for more information.
.PP
.I flags
are connection flags (see below)
.PP
.I pconn
is the connection context allocated by the library. This structure will be used for all future SASL calls for this connection.
.PP
.B Connection Flags
.PP
Flags that may be passed to
.B sasl_server_new()
include
.TP 0.8i
.B SASL_SUCCESS_DATA
The protocol supports a server-last send
.TP 0.8i
.B SASL_NEED_PROXY
Force the use of a mechanism that supports an authorization id that is
not the authentication id.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

sasl_client_new returns an integer which corresponds to one of the
following codes. SASL_OK is the only one that indicates success. All
others indicate errors and should either be handled or the
authentication session should be quit.

.SH ERRORS
.TP 0.8i
.B SASL_OK
Success
.TP 0.8i
.B SASL_BADPARAM
Error in config file or passed parameters
.TP 0.8i
.B SASL_NOMECH
No mechanism meets requested properties
.TP 0.8i
.B SASL_NOMEM
Not enough memory to complete operation

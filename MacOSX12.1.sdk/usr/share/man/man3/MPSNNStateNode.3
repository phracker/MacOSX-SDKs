.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
\fBA\fP placeholder node denoting the position in the graph of a \fBMPSState\fP object  Some filters need additional information about an image in order to function\&. For example a max-pooling gradient filter needs to know which position the max result came from in the original pooling filter in order to select the right data for gradient computation\&. In other cases, state may be moved into a \fBMPSState\fP object in order to keep the filter itself immutable\&. The \fBMPSState\fP object typically encapsulates one or more MTLResource objects\&.

Tag a state node for view later  Most state nodes are private to the graph\&. These alias memory heavily and consequently generally have invalid state when the graph exits\&. When exportFromGraph = YES, the image is preserved and made available through the [\fBMPSNNGraph\fP encode\&.\&.\&. resultStates:\&.\&.\&. list\&.
.PP
CAUTION: exporting an state from a graph prevents MPS from recycling memory\&. It will nearly always cause the amount of memory used by the graph to increase by the size of the state\&. There will probably be a performance regression accordingly\&. This feature should generally be used only when the node is needed as an input for further work and recomputing it is prohibitively costly\&.

.SS "\- (BOOL) synchronizeResource\fC [read]\fP, \fC [write]\fP, \fC [nonatomic]\fP, \fC [assign]\fP"
Set to true to cause the resource to be synchronized with the CPU  Ignored on non-MacOS\&.

.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBMPSImageErode\fP filter finds the minimum pixel value in a rectangular region centered around each pixel in the source image\&. It is like the \fBMPSImageAreaMin\fP, except that the intensity at each position is calculated relative to a different value before determining which is the maximum pixel value, allowing for shaped, non-rectangular morphological probes\&. 
.PP
.nf
for each pixel in the filter window:
    value =  pixel[filterY][filterX] + filter[filterY*filter_width+filterX]
    if( value < bestValue ){
         result = value
         bestValue = value;
    }

.fi
.PP
 \fBA\fP filter that contains all zeros is identical to a \fBMPSImageAreaMin\fP filter\&. The center filter element is assumed to be 0, to avoid causing a general lightening of the image\&.
.PP
The definition of the filter for \fBMPSImageErode\fP is different from vImage\&. (MPSErode_filter_value = 1\&.0f-vImageErode_filter_value\&.) This allows \fBMPSImageDilate\fP and \fBMPSImageErode\fP to use the same filter, making open and close operators easier to write\&. The edgeMode property is assumed to always be MPSImageEdgeModeClamp for this filter\&.

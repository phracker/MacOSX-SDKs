.Sh NAME
.Nm scalbn, scalbln
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double 
.Fn scalbn "double x" "int n"
.Ft long double 
.Fn scalbnl "long double x" "int n"
.Ft float
.Fn scalbnf "float x" "int n"
.Ft double 
.Fn scalbln "double x" "long int n"
.Ft long double 
.Fn scalblnl "long double x" "long int n"
.Ft float
.Fn scalblnf "float x" "long int n"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn scalbn
, and
.Fn scalbln
functions return
.Fa x Ns \(**(2** Ns Fa n )
computed by exponent manipulation.
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn scalbn "±0" "n"
returns ±0.
.Pp
.Fn scalbn "x" "0"
returns x.
.Pp
.Fn scalbn "±infinity" "n"
returns ±infinity.
.Pp
.Fn scalbln
has the same special values.
.Sh NOTE
The
.Fn scalb
function is deprecated.
.Fn scalbn
should be used instead.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn scalbn
functions to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following function provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vscalbf "vFloat x" "vSInt32" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3 ,
.Xr ldexp 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn scalbn
and
.Fn scalbln
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

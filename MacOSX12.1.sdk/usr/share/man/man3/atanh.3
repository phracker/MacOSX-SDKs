.Sh NAME
.Nm atanh
.Nd inverse hyperbolic tangent function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn atanh "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn atanhl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn atanhf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn atanh
function computes the inverse hyperbolic tangent
of the real
argument
.Ar x .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn atanh "±0"
returns ±0.
.Pp
.Fn atanh "±1"
returns ±infinity and raises the "divide-by-zero" floating-point exception.
.Pp
.Fn atanh "x"
returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception for |x| > 1.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn atanh
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vatanhf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvatanhf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvatanh "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acosh 3 ,
.Xr asinh 3 ,
.Xr exp 3 ,
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn atanh
function conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

When the code you're testing returns multiple lines, records or data
structures and they're just plain wrong, an equivalent to the Unix
\&\f(CW\*(C`diff\*(C'\fR utility may be just what's needed.  Here's output from an
example test script that checks two text documents and then two

eq_or_diff_...() compares two strings or (limited) data structures and
either emits an ok indication or a side-by-side diff.  Test::Differences
is designed to be used with Test.pm and with Test::Simple, Test::More,
and other Test::Builder based testing modules.  As the \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0 shows,
another testing module must be used as the basis for your test suite.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The options to \f(CW\*(C`eq_or_diff\*(C'\fR give some fine-grained control over the output.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`context\*(C'\fR
.Sp
This allows you to control the amount of context shown:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   eq_or_diff $got, $expected, $name, { context => 50000 };
.Ve
.Sp
will show you lots and lots of context.  Normally, \fBeq_or_diff()\fR uses
some heuristics to determine whether to show 3 lines of context (like
a normal unified diff) or 25 lines.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`data_type\*(C'\fR
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`text\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`data\*(C'\fR. See \f(CW\*(C`eq_or_diff_text\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eq_or_diff_data\*(C'\fR to
understand this. You can usually ignore this.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`Sortkeys\*(C'\fR
.Sp
If passed, whatever value is added is used as the argument for Data::Dumper
Sortkeys option. See the Data::Dumper docs to understand how you can
control the Sortkeys behavior.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`filename_a\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`filename_b\*(C'\fR
.Sp
The column headers to use in the output. They default to 'Got' and 'Expected'.
.SH "DIFF STYLES"
.IX Header "DIFF STYLES"
For extremely long strings, a table diff can wrap on your screen and be hard
to read.  If you are comfortable with different diff formats, you can switch
to a format more suitable for your data.  These are the four formats supported
by the Text::Diff module and are set with the following functions:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`table_diff\*(C'\fR (the default)
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`unified_diff\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`oldstyle_diff\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`context_diff\*(C'\fR
.PP
You can run the following to understand the different diff output styles:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& use Test::More \*(Aqno_plan\*(Aq;
\& use Test::Differences;
\&
\& my $long_string = join \*(Aq\*(Aq => 1..40;
\&

\&     local $TODO = \*(AqTesting diff styles\*(Aq;
\&
\&     # this is the default and does not need to explicitly set unless you need
\&     # to reset it back from another diff type
\&     table_diff;

.SH "UNICODE"
.IX Header "UNICODE"
Generally you'll find that the following test output is disappointing.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Test::Differences;
\&
\&    my $want = { \*(AqTraditional Chinese\*(Aq => \*(Aq中國\*(Aq };
\&    my $have = { \*(AqTraditional Chinese\*(Aq => \*(Aq中国\*(Aq };
\&
\&    eq_or_diff $have, $want, \*(AqUnicode, baby\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
The output looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 10

\&    Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
.Ve
.PP
This is generally not helpful and someone points out that you didn't declare
your test program as being utf8, so you do that:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Test::Differences;
\&    use utf8;
\&
\&    my $want = { \*(AqTraditional Chinese\*(Aq => \*(Aq中國\*(Aq };
\&    my $have = { \*(AqTraditional Chinese\*(Aq => \*(Aq中国\*(Aq };
\&
\&    eq_or_diff $have, $want, \*(AqUnicode, baby\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
Here's what you get:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&    #   Failed test \*(AqUnicode, baby\*(Aq
\&    #   at t/unicode.t line 12.
\&    # +\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+

\&    Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
\&    Failed 1/1 subtests
.Ve
.PP
That's better, but still awful. However, if you have \f(CW\*(C`Text::Diff\*(C'\fR 0.40 or
higher installed, you can add this to your code:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    BEGIN { $ENV{DIFF_OUTPUT_UNICODE} = 1 }
.Ve
.PP
Make sure you do this \fIbefore\fR you load Text::Diff. Then this is the output:
.PP
.Vb 6

.SH "DEPLOYING"
.IX Header "DEPLOYING"
There are several basic ways of deploying Test::Differences requiring more or less
labor by you or your users.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fallback to \f(CW\*(C`is_deeply\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This is your best option if you want this module to be optional.
.Sp
.Vb 6

\& }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4

.Sp
.Vb 1
\& eval "use Test::Differences";
.Ve
.Sp
If you want to detect the presence of Test::Differences on the fly, something
like the following code might do the trick for you:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use Test qw( !ok );   ## get all syms *except* ok
\&
\&    eval "use Test::Differences";
\&    use Data::Dumper;
\&

\&        @_ = map ref $_ ? Dumper( @_ ) : $_, @_;
\&        goto Test::&ok;

.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1PREREQ_PM\s0 => { .... \*(L"Test::Differences\*(R" => 0, ... }
.Sp
This method will let \s-1CPAN\s0 and \s-1CPANPLUS\s0 users download it automatically.  It
will discomfit those users who choose/have to download all packages manually.
.IP "\(bu" 4
t/lib/Test/Differences.pm, t/lib/Text/Diff.pm, ...
.Sp
By placing Test::Differences and its prerequisites in the t/lib directory, you
avoid forcing your users to download the Test::Differences manually if they
aren't using \s-1CPAN\s0 or \s-1CPANPLUS.\s0
.Sp
If you put a \f(CW\*(C`use lib "t/lib";\*(C'\fR in the top of each test suite before the
\&\f(CW\*(C`use Test::Differences;\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR should work well.

You might want to check once in a while for new Test::Differences releases
if you do this.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.IX Header "LIMITATIONS"
.ie n .SS """Test"" or ""Test::More"""
.el .SS "\f(CWTest\fP or \f(CWTest::More\fP"
.IX Subsection "Test or Test::More"
This module \*(L"mixes in\*(R" with Test.pm or any of the test libraries based on
Test::Builder (Test::Simple, Test::More, etc).  It does this by peeking to see
whether Test.pm or Test/Builder.pm is in \f(CW%INC\fR, so if you are not using one of
those, it will print a warning and play dumb by not emitting test numbers (or
incrementing them).  If you are using one of these, it should interoperate
nicely.
.SS "Exporting"
.IX Subsection "Exporting"
Exports all 3 functions by default (and by design).  Use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Test::Differences ();
.Ve
.PP
to suppress this behavior if you don't like the namespace pollution.
.PP
This module will not override functions like \fBok()\fR, \fBis()\fR, \fBis_deeply()\fR, etc.  If
it did, then you could \f(CW\*(C`eval "use Test::Differences qw( is_deeply );"\*(C'\fR to get
automatic upgrading to diffing behaviors without the \f(CW\*(C`sub my_ok\*(C'\fR shown above.
Test::Differences intentionally does not provide this behavior because this
would mean that Test::Differences would need to emulate every popular test
module out there, which would require far more coding and maintenance that I'm
willing to do.  Use the eval and my_ok deployment shown above if you want some
level of automation.
.SS "Unicode"
.IX Subsection "Unicode"
Perls before 5.6.0 don't support characters > 255 at all, and 5.6.0
seems broken.  This means that you might get odd results using perl5.6.0
with unicode strings.
.ie n .SS """Data::Dumper"" and older Perls."
.el .SS "\f(CWData::Dumper\fP and older Perls."
.IX Subsection "Data::Dumper and older Perls."
Relies on Data::Dumper (for now), which, prior to perl5.8, will not always
report hashes in the same order.  \f(CW $Data::Dumper::Sortkeys \fR \fIis\fR set to 1,
so on more recent versions of Data::Dumper, this should not occur.  Check \s-1CPAN\s0
to see if it's been peeled out of the main perl distribution and backported.
Reported by Ilya Martynov <ilya@martynov.org>, although the Sortkeys \*(L"future
perfect\*(R" workaround has been set in anticipation of a new Data::Dumper for a
while.  Note that the two hashes should report the same here:

This was carefully explained to me in words of two syllables or less by
Yves Orton <demerphq@hotmail.com>.  The plan to address this is to allow
you to select Data::Denter or some other module of your choice as an
option.

.IX Subsection "Code-refs"
Test::Differences turns on \f(CW$Data::Dumper::Deparse\fR, so any code-refs in your
data structures will be turned into text before they are examined, using
B::Deparse. The precise text generated for a sub-ref might not be what you
expect as it is generated from the compiled version of the code, but it should
at least be consistent and spot differences correctly.

You can turn this behaviour off by setting \f(CW$Test::Differences::NoDeparse\fR.

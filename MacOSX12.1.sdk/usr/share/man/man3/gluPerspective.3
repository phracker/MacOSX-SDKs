.SH NAME
.B "gluPerspective
\- set up a perspective projection matrix

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3gluPerspective\fP(
GLdouble \fIfovy\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3void \fPgluPerspective( 'u
	GLdouble \fIaspect\fP,
	GLdouble \fIzNear\fP,
	GLdouble \fIzFar\fP )
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIaspect\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2fovy\fP
Specifies the field of view angle, in degrees, in the \f2y\fP direction.
.TP
\f2aspect\fP
Specifies the aspect ratio that determines
the field of view in the \f2x\fP direction.
The aspect ratio is the ratio of \f2x\fP (width) to \f2y\fP (height).
.TP
\f2zNear\fP
Specifies the distance from the viewer to the near clipping plane
(always positive).
.TP
\f2zFar\fP
Specifies the distance from the viewer to the far clipping plane
(always positive).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluPerspective\fP specifies a viewing frustum into the world coordinate system.
In general, the aspect ratio in \%\f3gluPerspective\fP should match the aspect ratio
of the associated viewport. For example, aspect = 2.0 means 
the viewer's
angle of view is twice as wide in \f2x\fP as it is in \f2y\fP.
If the viewport is
twice as wide as it is tall, it displays the image without distortion.
.P
The matrix generated by \%\f3gluPerspective\fP is multipled by the current matrix,
just as if \f3glMultMatrix\fP were called with the generated matrix.
To load the perspective matrix onto the current matrix stack instead,
precede the call to \%\f3gluPerspective\fP with a call to \f3glLoadIdentity\fP.
.P
Given \f2f\fP defined as follows:
.sp
.ce
f  = cotangent(fovy/2)

The generated matrix is

.SH NOTES
Depth buffer precision is affected by the values specified for
\f2zNear\fP and \f2zFar\fP.
The greater the ratio of \f2zFar\fP to \f2zNear\fP is,
the less effective the depth buffer will be at distinguishing between
surfaces that are near each other.
If 

.ce
r = zFar/zNear

.P
roughly log2(r) bits of depth buffer precision are lost.
Because r approaches infinity as \f2zNear\fP approaches 0,
\f2zNear\fP must never be set to 0.

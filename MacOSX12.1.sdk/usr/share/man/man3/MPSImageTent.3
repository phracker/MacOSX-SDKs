.PP 
The box filter, while fast, may yield square-ish looking blur effects\&. However, multiple passes of the box filter tend to smooth out with each additional pass\&. For example, two 3-wide box blurs produces the same effective convolution as a 5-wide tent blur:

1   1   1
    1   1   1
+       1   1   1

.PP
 Addition passes tend to approximate a gaussian line shape\&.
.PP
The \fBMPSImageTent\fP convolves an image with a tent filter\&. These form a tent shape with incrementally increasing sides, for example: 
.PP
.nf
1   2   3   2   1


1   2   1
2   4   2
1   2   1

Like the box filter, this arrangement allows for much faster algorithms, espcially for for larger blur radii but with a more pleasing appearance\&.
.PP
The tent blur is a separable filter\&. The implementation is aware of this and will act accordingly to give best performance for multi-dimensional blurs\&.

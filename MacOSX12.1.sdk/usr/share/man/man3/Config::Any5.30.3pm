.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Config::Any provides a facility for Perl applications and libraries
to load configuration data from multiple different file formats. It supports \s-1XML, YAML,
JSON,\s0 Apache-style configuration, Windows \s-1INI\s0 files, and even Perl code.
.PP
The rationale for this module is as follows: Perl programs are deployed on many different
platforms and integrated with many different systems. Systems administrators and end
users may prefer different configuration formats than the developers. The flexibility
inherent in a multiple format configuration loader allows different users to make
different choices, without generating extra work for the developers. As a developer
you only need to learn a single interface to be able to use the power of different
configuration formats.

\&    Config::Any\->load_files( { files => \e@files, use_ext => 1 } );
\&    Config::Any\->load_files( { files => \e@files, flatten_to_hash => 1 } );
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`load_files()\*(C'\fR attempts to load configuration from the list of files passed in
the \f(CW\*(C`files\*(C'\fR parameter, if the file exists.
.PP
If the \f(CW\*(C`filter\*(C'\fR parameter is set, it is used as a callback to modify the configuration
data before it is returned. It will be passed a single hash-reference parameter which
it should modify in-place.
.PP
If the \f(CW\*(C`use_ext\*(C'\fR parameter is defined, the loader will attempt to parse the file
extension from each filename and will skip the file unless it matches a standard
extension for the loading plugins. Only plugins whose standard extensions match the
file extension will be used. For efficiency reasons, its use is encouraged, but
be aware that you will lose flexibility \*(-- for example, a file called \f(CW\*(C`myapp.cfg\*(C'\fR
containing \s-1YAML\s0 data will not be offered to the \s-1YAML\s0 plugin, whereas \f(CW\*(C`myapp.yml\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`myapp.yaml\*(C'\fR would be.
.PP
When the \f(CW\*(C`flatten_to_hash\*(C'\fR parameter is defined, the loader will return a hash
keyed on the file names, as opposed to the usual list of single-key hashes.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`load_files()\*(C'\fR also supports a 'force_plugins' parameter, whose value should be an
arrayref of plugin names like \f(CW\*(C`Config::Any::INI\*(C'\fR. Its intended use is to allow the use
of a non-standard file extension while forcing it to be offered to a particular parser.
It is not compatible with 'use_ext'.
.PP
You can supply a \f(CW\*(C`driver_args\*(C'\fR hashref to pass special options to a particular
parser object. Example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    Config::Any\->load_files( { files => \e@files, driver_args => {
\&        General => { \-LowerCaseNames => 1 }
\&    } )

\&    Config::Any\->load_stems( { stems => \e@stems, filter  => \e&filter } );
\&    Config::Any\->load_stems( { stems => \e@stems, use_ext => 1 } );
\&    Config::Any\->load_stems( { stems => \e@stems, flatten_to_hash => 1 } );
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`load_stems()\*(C'\fR attempts to load configuration from a list of files which it generates
by combining the filename stems list passed in the \f(CW\*(C`stems\*(C'\fR parameter with the
potential filename extensions from each loader, which you can check with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`extensions()\*(C'\fR classmethod described below. Once this list of possible filenames is
built it is treated exactly as in \f(CW\*(C`load_files()\*(C'\fR above, as which it takes the same
parameters. Please read the \f(CW\*(C`load_files()\*(C'\fR documentation before using this method.
.SS "finder( )"
.IX Subsection "finder( )"
The \f(CW\*(C`finder()\*(C'\fR classmethod returns the
Module::Pluggable::Object
object which is used to load the plugins. See the documentation for that module for
more information.
.SS "plugins( )"
.IX Subsection "plugins( )"
The \f(CW\*(C`plugins()\*(C'\fR classmethod returns the names of configuration loading plugins as
found by Module::Pluggable::Object.
.SS "extensions( )"
.IX Subsection "extensions( )"
The \f(CW\*(C`extensions()\*(C'\fR classmethod returns the possible file extensions which can be loaded
by \f(CW\*(C`load_stems()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`load_files()\*(C'\fR. This may be useful if you set the \f(CW\*(C`use_ext\*(C'\fR
parameter to those methods.

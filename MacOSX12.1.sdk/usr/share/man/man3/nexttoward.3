.Sh NAME
.Nm nexttoward
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double 
.Fn nexttoward "double x" "long double y"
.Ft long double 
.Fn nexttowardl "long double x" "long double y"
.Ft float
.Fn nexttowardf "float x" "long double y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn nexttoward 
functions return the next machine representable number from 
.Fa x
in direction of
.Fa y .
It is identical to
.Fn nextafter
except that the second parameter has type long double, and the function returns
.Fa y
converted to the type of the function if
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
are equal.
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn nexttoward "x" "y"
raises the "overflow" and "inexact" floating-point exceptions for x finite and the function value infinite.
.Pp
.Fn nexttoward "x" "y"
raises the "underflow" and "inexact" floating-point exceptions for the function value subnormal or zero and x not equal to y.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nextafter 3
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn nexttoward
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

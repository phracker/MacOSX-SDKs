\- load a name onto the name stack

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glLoadName\fP(
GLuint \fIname\fP )
.nf
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2name\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2name\fP
Specifies a name that will replace the top value on the name stack.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The name stack is used during selection mode to allow sets of rendering
commands to be uniquely identified.
It consists of an ordered set of unsigned integers.
\%\f3glLoadName\fP causes \f2name\fP to replace the value on the top of the name stack,
which is initially empty.
.P
The name stack is always empty while the render mode is not \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP.
Calls to \%\f3glLoadName\fP while the render mode is not \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP are ignored.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glLoadName\fP is called while the
name stack is empty.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glLoadName\fP is executed between
the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_NAME_STACK_DEPTH\fP
.br
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_MAX_NAME_STACK_DEPTH\fP

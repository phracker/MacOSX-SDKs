.SS "\- (nonnull instancetype) copyWithZone: (nullable NSZone *) zone(nullable id< MTLDevice >) device"

.PP
Create a a copy of this acceleration structure\&. The acceleration structure may be copied to a different Metal device\&. Buffer properties of the acceleration structure such as the vertex buffer, instance, buffer, etc\&. are set to nil\&. Copy these buffers to new Metal device and assign them to the new acceleration structure instead\&. Do not copy the acceleration structure until any prior refit or rebuild operations have completed\&.
.PP

\fIzone\fP This parameter is ignored\&. Memory zones are no longer used by Objective-C\&.

.PP
Create a a copy of this acceleration structure\&. The acceleration structure may be copied with a different acceleration structure group\&. Buffer properties of the acceleration structure such as the vertex buffer, instance buffer, etc\&. are set to nil\&. Copy these buffers with the new Metal device and assign them to the new acceleration structure instead\&. Do not copy the acceleration structure until any prior refit or rebuild operations have completed\&.

.SS "\- (void) encodeRefitToCommandBuffer: (nonnull id< MTLCommandBuffer >) commandBuffer"

.PP
Refit the existing acceleration structure to new data\&. This method is used to refit the acceleration structure to new vertex data, index data, instance data, etc\&. while preserving the existing acceleration structure topology\&. This is typically much faster than a full rebuild of the acceleration structure\&. Refitting can also be pipelined with other GPU work such as ray intersection\&.
.PP
Until the command buffer has completed, the acceleration structure cannot be copied, encoded with \fBNSSecureCoding\fP, or rebuilt\&. Changes to properties such as the triangle count or instance might not be reflected\&. These changes require that the acceleration structure be rebuilt instead\&. The acceleration structure must be rebuilt at least once before this method can be called\&. 
.SS "\- (void) encodeWithCoder: (NSCoder *__nonnull) coder"

.PP
Encode the acceleration structure with an NSCoder\&. Buffer properties such as the vertex buffer, index buffer, etc\&. are not be encoded\&. Encode and decode these buffers along with the acceleration structure instead\&. Do not encode the acceleration structure until any prior refit or rebuild operations have completed\&.

.SS "\- (nonnull instancetype) init "

.SS "\- (nullable instancetype) \fBinitWithCoder:\fP (NSCoder *__nonnull) aDecoder(nonnull id< MTLDevice >) device"

.PP
Initialize the acceleration structure with an NSCoder and a Metal device\&. Buffer properties such as the vertex buffer, instance buffer, etc\&. are set to nil\&. Encode and decode these buffers along with the acceleration structure instead\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBMPSKernel\fP\&.
.SS "\- (nullable instancetype) \fBinitWithCoder:\fP (NSCoder *__nonnull) aDecoder(nonnull \fBMPSAccelerationStructureGroup\fP *) group"

.PP
Initialize the acceleration structure with an NSCoder and an acceleration structure group, if the acceleration structure will be used in an instance hierarchy\&. All acceleration structures in the instance hierarchy must share the same group\&. Buffer properties such as the vertex buffer, instance buffer, etc\&. are set to nil\&. Encode and decode these buffers along with the acceleration structure instead\&. 
.SS "\- (nonnull instancetype) initWithDevice: (nonnull id< MTLDevice >) device"

.PP
Initialize the acceleration structure with a Metal device\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBMPSKernel\fP\&.
.SS "\- (nonnull instancetype) initWithGroup: (\fBMPSAccelerationStructureGroup\fP *_Nonnull) group"

.PP
Initialize the acceleration structure with an acceleration structure group, if the acceleration structure will be used in an instance hierarchy\&. The Metal device is determined from the acceleration structure group\&. All acceleration structures in the instance hierarchy must share the same group\&. 
.SS "\- (void) rebuild "

.PP
Rebuild the acceleration structure\&. This method must be called before any intersection tests can be scheduled with this acceleration structure\&. Before calling this method, fill out the properties of the acceleration structure such as vertex buffer, instance buffer, etc\&. The acceleration structure should be rebuilt when its contents (e\&.g\&. vertices in a triangle acceleration structure) have been modified significantly and must be rebuilt when properties such as triangle count, vertex stride, etc\&. have changed\&. When the contents of the acceleration structure have only been modified slightly, it may be cheaper to refit the acceleration structure instead\&.
.PP
This method blocks until the acceleration structure has been rebuilt\&. Until the rebuild has completed, the acceleration structure cannot be copied, encoded with \fBNSSecureCoding\fP, rebuilt, or refit\&. Before this method can be called, any pending GPU writes to the vertex buffer, index buffer, etc\&. must be completed (and, for managed buffers, synchronized)\&. Any prior intersection tests must also be completed before the acceleration structure can be rebuilt\&. 
.SS "\- (void) rebuildWithCompletionHandler: (nonnull \fBMPSAccelerationStructureCompletionHandler\fP) completionHandler"

.PP
Rebuild the acceleration structure asynchronously\&. This method must be called before any intersection tests can be scheduled with this acceleration structure\&. Before calling this method, fill out the properties of the acceleration structure such as vertex buffer, instance buffer, etc\&. The acceleration structure should be rebuilt when its contents (e\&.g\&. vertices in a triangle acceleration structure) have been modified significantly and must be rebuilt when properties such as triangle count, vertex stride, etc\&. have changed\&. When the contents of the acceleration structure have only been modified slightly, it may be cheaper to refit the acceleration structure instead\&.
.PP
Until the rebuild has completed, the acceleration structure cannot be copied, encoded with \fBNSSecureCoding\fP, rebuilt, or refit\&. Before this method can be called, any pending GPU writes to the vertex buffer, index buffer, etc\&. must be completed (and, for managed buffers, synchronized)\&. Any prior intersection tests must also be completed before the acceleration structure can be rebuilt\&.

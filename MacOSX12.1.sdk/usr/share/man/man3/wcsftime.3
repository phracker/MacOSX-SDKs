.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcsftime
function is equivalent to the
.Fn strftime
function, except for the types of its arguments.
Refer to
.Xr strftime 3
for a detailed description.
.Pp
While the
.Fn wcsftime
function uses the current locale, the
.Fn wcsftime_l
function may be passed a locale directly. See
.Xr xlocale 3
for more information.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Some early implementations of
.Fn wcsftime
had a
.Fa format
argument with type
.Vt "const char *" ,
instead of
.Vt "const wchar_t *" .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr strftime 3 ,
.Xr xlocale 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcsftime
function conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .

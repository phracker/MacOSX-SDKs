.Ft "int"
.Fn openpam_nullconv "int n" "const struct pam_message **msg" "struct pam_response **resp" "void *data"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function is a null conversation function suitable
for applications that want to use PAM but don't support interactive
dialog with the user.
Such applications should set
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK
to whatever authentication
token they've obtained on their own before calling
.Xr pam_authenticate 3
and / or
.Xr pam_chauthtok 3 ,
and their PAM configuration should specify the
.Dv use_first_pass
option for all modules that require access to the
authentication token, to make sure they use
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK
rather than
try to query the user.
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
function returns one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It Bq Er PAM_CONV_ERR
Conversation failure.

.Sh NAME
.Nm kdumpd
.Nd Mac OS X remote kernel core dump server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /usr/libexec/kdumpd
.Op Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Kdumpd
is a server which receives
kernel states in the form of
a core dump from a remote 
Mac OS X machine.
The
.Tn kdumpd
server operates
on UDP port 1069, although this
may be configurable in the future.
The server should be started by
.Xr launchctl 1 .
.Pp
The server should have the user ID
with the lowest possible privilege,
usually the user "nobody". 
.Pp
By default the server stores kernel cores
in the directory
.Pa /var/tmp/PanicDumps .
The directory needs to already exist for kdumpd
to save core dumps.
.Pp
The server returns an EEXIST error
to the remote kernel if it receives a
request for an existing file - i.e.
only new files can be created. The server
also disallows path specifications in the
incoming file name. 
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command is based on Berkeley
.Xr tftpd 8 ,
by way of FreeBSD, with several modifications.
.Sh SEE ALSO

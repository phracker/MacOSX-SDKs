Prompts to add a new firmware password or change and existing password if one exists.
.It Fl setmode Ar mode [-allow-oroms]
Set the mode to "command" or "full".  "Command" will prompt for the firmware password if the user attempts to boot from a different volume.  "Full" will prompt on every startup (not recommended).  Optional "allow-oroms" flag will permit option roms execution, that is denied by default once firmware password is set.
.It Fl mode
Displays the current mode if one is set.
.It Fl check
Displays whether or not a firmware password is set.
.Pp
.It Fl delete
Prompts for password and clears both password and the mode if correct.
.It Fl verify
Prompts for password and displays success if correct.
.It Fl unlockseed
Generates a firmware password recovery key.  Note: Machine must be stable for this command to generate a valid seed.  No pending changes that need a restart.  NOTE: Seed is only valid until the next time a firmware password command runs.
.It Fl disable-reset-capability
Disables firmware password reset using unlockseed.
.It Fl enable-reset-capability
Enables firmware password reset using unlockseed.

.\"																				DESCRIPTION 
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm 
command is used to install macOS installer packages to a specified domain
or volume.
The 
.Nm 
command installs a single package per invocation, which is specified with the
.Fl package
parameter (
.Fl pkg
is accepted as a synonym).
It may be either a single package or a metapackage.
In the case of the metapackage, the packages which are part of the default
install will be installed unless disqualified by a package's check tool(s). 
.Pp
The target volume is specified with the
.Fl target
parameter (
.Fl tgt
is accepted as a synonym).
It must already be mounted when the
.Nm 
command is invoked.
.Pp
The 
.Nm 
command requires root privileges to run.
If a package requires authentication (set in a package's .info file) the
.Nm 
must be either run as root or with the
.Xr sudo 8
command (but see further discussion under the
.Fl store
option).
.Pp
The
.Nm 
is not responsible for rebooting the machine after installing.
Use 
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr shutdown 8
-r now to reboot the system.
.Pp
The
.Nm 
displays two forms of output.
The default terse output is intended for parsing by scripting languages for
automating (or scripting) installs and verbose output providing additional
information and descriptive error messages.
.Pp
A list of flags and their descriptions:
.Bl -tag -width indent 
.It Fl dominfo
Displays a list of domains into which the software package can be installed.
For example:
.Ar LocalSystem
or
.Ar CurrentUserHomeDirectory .
The domains listed are those which are available and enabled when the command
is run.
.It Fl volinfo
Displays a list of volumes onto which the software package can be installed.
The volumes listed are the mounted volumes available when the command is run.
.It Fl pkginfo
Displays a list of packages that can be installed onto the target volume.
If a metapackage is given as the package source, all of its subpackages are
listed.
.It Fl query Ar flag
Queries a package for information about the metadata.
See 
.Ar -help
for supported flags.
.It Fl allowUntrusted
Allow install of a package signed by an untrusted (or expired) certificate.
.It Fl dumplog
Detailed log information is always sent to syslog using the LOG_INSTALL
facility (and will wind up in /var/log/install.log).
.Fl dumplog
additionally writes this log to standard error output.
.It Fl help                 
Displays the help screen describing the list of parameters.
.It Fl verbose            
Displays more descriptive information than the default output.
Use this parameter in conjunction with 
.Ar -pkginfo
and
.Ar -volinfo 
information requests to see more readable output.
The default output is formatted for scripting.
.It Fl verboseR            
Displays same information as 
.Ar -verbose
except the output is formatted for easy parsing.
.It Fl vers
Displays the version of this command.
.It Fl config
Formats the command line installation arguments for later use.
The output is sent to stdout, but can be redirected to a file to create a
configuration file.
When specifying this option, an installation is not actually performed.
This configuration file can be supplied as the argument to the
.Ar -file
parameter instead of typing a long series of installation arguments.
The config file can be used to perform multiple identical installs.
You can create a config file as follows:
.Pp
.Nm
-pkg ~/Documents/Foo.pkg -target /
.Fl config 
> /tmp/configfile.plist
.It Fl plist
Formats the 
.Nm
output into an XML file, which is sent by default to stdout.
Use this parameter for
.Ar -dominfo,
.Ar -volinfo,
and
.Ar -pkginfo
.
.It Fl file Ar pathToFile
Specifies the path to the XML file containing parameter information in the
key/value dictionary.
This file can be used instead of the command line parameters, and supersedes
any parameters on the command line.
When you type this parameter, you type the path to the XML file.  Use with config file generated by
.Ar -config
.
For example:
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl file
/tmp/configfile.plist
.It Fl lang Ar ISOLanguageCode
Default language of installed system (ISO format).
This is only necessary when performing a system (OS) install, otherwise is it
ignored.
There is no verification done to make sure that the language being set
actually exists on the machine, however the ISO language code is verified to
ensure that it is valid.
.It Fl listiso
Display the list of valid ISO language codes the
.Nm
recognizes.
.It Fl showChoiceChangesXML
Prints to stdout the install choices for the package (specified with
.Fl pkg )
in an XML format. This allows choice attributes to be modified and applied at install-time using
.Fl applyChoiceChangesXML .
See
.Sx CHOICE CHANGES FILE
for details of this XML format.
.It Fl applyChoiceChangesXML Ar pathToXMLFile
Applies the install choice changes specified in
.Ar pathToXMLFile
to the default choices in the package before installation. This allows the command-line installer
to customize choice what gets installed. See
.Sx CHOICE CHANGES FILE
for details of this XML format. Any problems encountered while applying the choice changes will be
reported to the LOG_INSTALL facility (i.e. to /var/log/install.log), and also to stdout if 
.Fl dumplog
is used.
.It Fl showChoicesAfterApplyingChangesXML Ar pathToXMLFile
Applies the install choice changes specified in
.Ar pathToXMLFile
to the default choices in the package, and then dumps the resulting choice state to stdout.
The input and output XML format is as described in
.Sx CHOICE CHANGES FILE .
Since changing one choice in a package can implicitly change other choices, this option allows
you to confirm that a particular choiceChanges file will have the intended effect. You must specify a
.Fl target
when using this option, since the evaluated choices can also change with the state of the target disk. 
.It Fl showChoicesXML
Prints to stdout the install choices for the package (specified with
.Fl pkg )
in a hierarchical XML format. This is
.Sy not
the same format as used with
.Fl applyChoiceChangesXML .
This option is provided for System Image Utility only.
.It Fl store
Install the product archive specified by
.Fl package ,
in the same way that it would be installed through the Mac App Store. In this mode, no
other options are supported. (You can specify
.Fl target ,
but the only allowable value is the root volume mount point, /). For best Mac App Store fidelity, run
.Nm
as an admin user (not using sudo); you will prompted for your admin user's password before the install begins.
.Pp
This mode is provided for testing a product archive before submission to the Mac App Store. See
.Xr productbuild 1
for how to create a product archive.

.\"																				DEVICES 
.Sh DEVICES
A device parameter for the target is any one of the following:
.Pp
1) Any of the values returned by
.Ar -dominfo
.br
2) The device node entry.
Any entry of the form of /dev/disk*.
ex: /dev/disk2
.br
3) The disk identifier.
Any entry of the form of disk*.
ex: disk1s9
.br
4) The volume mount point.
Any entry of the form of /Volumes/Mountpoint.
ex: /Volumes/Untitled
.br
5) The volume UUID.
ex: 376C4046-083E-334F-AF08-62FAFBC4E352
.\"																				CHOICE CHANGES FILE 
.Sh CHOICE CHANGES FILE
A
.Dq choiceChanges
file allows individual installer choices to be selected or deselected. A template choiceChanges
file for a given package can be generated with the
.Cm -showChoiceChangesXML
option, and is interpreted as follows.
.Pp
The choiceChanges file is a property list containing an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary
has the following three keys:
.Bl -column ".Sy choiceIdentifier" A012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
.It Sy Key Ta Sy Description
.It Sy choiceIdentifier Ta "Identifier for the choice to be modified (string)"
.It Sy choiceAttribute Ta "One of the attribute names described below (string)"
.It Sy attributeSetting Ta "A setting that depends on the choiceAttribute, described below (number or string)"
.El
.Pp
The 
.Sy choiceAttribute
and
.Sy attributeSetting
values are as follows:
.Bl -column ".Sy choiceIdentifier" A012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
.It Sy choiceAttribute Ta Sy attributeSetting Description
.It Sy selected Ta "(number) 1 to select the choice, 0 to deselect it"
.It Sy enabled Ta "(number) 1 to enable the choice, 0 to disable it"
.It Sy visible Ta "(number) 1 to show the choice, 0 to hide it"
.It Sy customLocation Ta "(string) path at which to install the choice (see below)"
.El
.Pp
Note that there can be multiple dictionaries for the same 
.Sy choiceIdentifier ,
since there can be multiple attributes set for a single choice.
.Pp
The
.Sy customLocation
attribute can be set for a choice only if that choice explicitly allows a user-defined path. That is,
if the choice would have a Location popup when viewed in the Customize pane of the Installer application,
it can be set via
.Sy customLocation .
(Otherwise, installation paths cannot be arbitrarily modified, since the package author must account
for custom install locations for the installation to work properly.)

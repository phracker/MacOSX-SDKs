\fBpostscreen\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix \fBpostscreen\fR(8) server provides additional
protection against mail server overload. One \fBpostscreen\fR(8)
process handles multiple inbound SMTP connections, and decides
which clients may talk to a Postfix SMTP server process.
By keeping spambots away, \fBpostscreen\fR(8) leaves more
SMTP server processes available for legitimate clients, and
delays the onset of server overload conditions.

This program should not be used on SMTP ports that receive
mail from end\-user clients (MUAs). In a typical deployment,
\fBpostscreen\fR(8) handles the MX service on TCP port 25, and
\fBsmtpd\fR(8) receives mail from MUAs on the \fBsubmission\fR
service (TCP port 587) which requires client authentication.
Alternatively, a site could set up a dedicated, non\-postscreen,
"port 25" server that provides \fBsubmission\fR service and
client authentication, but no MX service.

\fBpostscreen\fR(8) maintains a temporary whitelist for
clients that have passed a number of tests.  When an SMTP
client IP address is whitelisted, \fBpostscreen\fR(8) hands
off the connection immediately to a Postfix SMTP server
process. This minimizes the overhead for legitimate mail.

By default, \fBpostscreen\fR(8) logs statistics and hands
off each connection to a Postfix SMTP server process, while
excluding clients in mynetworks from all tests (primarily,
to avoid problems with non\-standard SMTP implementations
in network appliances).  This default mode blocks no clients,
and is useful for non\-destructive testing.

In a typical production setting, \fBpostscreen\fR(8) is
configured to reject mail from clients that fail one or
more tests. \fBpostscreen\fR(8) logs rejected mail with the
client address, helo, sender and recipient information.

\fBpostscreen\fR(8) is not an SMTP proxy; this is intentional.
The purpose is to keep spambots away from Postfix SMTP
server processes, while minimizing overhead for legitimate
traffic.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostscreen\fR(8) server is moderately security\-sensitive.
It talks to untrusted clients on the network. The process
can be run chrooted at fixed low privilege.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostscreen\fR(8) built\-in SMTP protocol engine
currently does not announce support for AUTH, XCLIENT or
XFORWARD.
If you need to make these services available
on port 25, then do not enable the optional "after 220
server greeting" tests.

The optional "after 220 server greeting" tests may result in
unexpected delivery delays from senders that retry email delivery
from a different IP address.  Reason: after passing these tests a
new client must disconnect, and reconnect from the same IP
address before it can deliver mail. See POSTSCREEN_README, section
"Tests after the 220 SMTP server greeting", for a discussion.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to main.cf are not picked up automatically, as
\fBpostscreen\fR(8) processes may run for several hours.
Use the command "postfix reload" after a configuration
change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.

NOTE: Some \fBpostscreen\fR(8) parameters implement
stress\-dependent behavior.  This is supported only when the
default parameter value is stress\-dependent (that is, it
looks like ${stress?{X}:{Y}}, or it is the $\fIname\fR
of an smtpd parameter with a stress\-dependent default).
Other parameters always evaluate as if the \fBstress\fR
parameter value is the empty string.

.SH "PERMANENT WHITE/BLACKLIST TEST"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
This test is executed immediately after a remote SMTP client
connects. If a client is permanently whitelisted, the client
will be handed off immediately to a Postfix SMTP server
process.
.IP "\fBpostscreen_access_list (permit_mynetworks)\fR"
Permanent white/blacklist for remote SMTP client IP addresses.

.SH "MAIL EXCHANGER POLICY TESTS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
When \fBpostscreen\fR(8) is configured to monitor all primary
and backup MX addresses, it can refuse to whitelist clients
that connect to a backup MX address only. For small sites,
this requires configuring primary and backup MX addresses
on the same MTA. Larger sites would have to share the
\fBpostscreen\fR(8) cache between primary and backup MTAs,
which would introduce a common point of failure.
.IP "\fBpostscreen_whitelist_interfaces (static:all)\fR"

non\-whitelisted remote SMTP client can obtain \fBpostscreen\fR(8)'s temporary
whitelist status.

.nf
.ad

These tests are executed before the remote SMTP client
receives the "220 servername" greeting. If no tests remain
after the successful completion of this phase, the client
will be handed off immediately to a Postfix SMTP server
process.

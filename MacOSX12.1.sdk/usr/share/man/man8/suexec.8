.SH NAME
suexec \- Switch user before executing external programs

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
 
.PP
\fB\fBsuexec\fR -\fBV\fR\fR
 

.SH "SUMMARY"
 
.PP
\fBsuexec\fR is used by the Apache HTTP Server to switch to another user before executing CGI programs\&. In order to achieve this, it must run as \fBroot\fR\&. Since the HTTP daemon normally doesn't run as \fBroot\fR, the \fBsuexec\fR executable needs the setuid bit set and must be owned by \fBroot\fR\&. It should never be writable for any other person than \fBroot\fR\&.
 
.PP
For further information about the concepts and the security model of suexec please refer to the suexec documentation (http://httpd\&.apache\&.org/docs/2\&.4/suexec\&.html)\&.
 

.SH "OPTIONS"
 
 
.TP
\fB-V\fR
If you are \fBroot\fR, this option displays the compile options of \fBsuexec\fR\&. For security reasons all configuration options are changeable only at compile time\&.

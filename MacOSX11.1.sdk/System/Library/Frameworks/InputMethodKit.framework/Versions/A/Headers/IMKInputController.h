    @protocol    IMKServerInput
    @abstract    Informal protocol which is used to send user events to an input method.
    @discussion  This is not a formal protocol by choice.  The reason for that is that there are three ways to receive events here. An input method should choose one of those ways and  implement the appropriate methods.  
                 
                 Here are the three approaches:
                 
                 1.  Support keybinding.  
                        In this approach the system takes each keydown and trys to map the keydown to an action method that the input method has implemented.  If an action is found the system calls didCommandBySelector:client:.  If no action method is found inputText:client: is called.  An input method choosing this approach should implement
                        -(BOOL)inputText:(NSString*)string client:(id)sender;
                        -(BOOL)didCommandBySelector:(SEL)aSelector client:(id)sender;
                        
                2. Receive all key events without the keybinding, but do "unpack" the relevant text data.
                        Key events are broken down into the Unicodes, the key code that generated them, and modifier flags.  This data is then sent to the input method's inputText:key:modifiers:client: method.  For this approach implement:
                        -(BOOL)inputText:(NSString*)string key:(NSInteger)keyCode modifiers:(NSUInteger)flags client:(id)sender;
                        
                3. Receive events directly from the Text Services Manager as NSEvent objects.  For this approach implement:
                        -(BOOL)handleEvent:(NSEvent*)event client:(id)sender;
*/

*/
- (BOOL)inputText:(NSString*)string key:(NSInteger)keyCode modifiers:(NSUInteger)flags client:(id)sender;

/*!
    @method     
    @abstract   Each keydown that does not map to an action method is delivered to the input method as an NSString.

    @method     
    @abstract   Called when system binds a keyDown event to an action method.  
    @discussion This method is designed to return YES if the command is handled and NO if the command is not handled. It is called to process a command that was generated by user action such as typing certain keys or mousing down. It is necessary for this method to return YES or NO so the  event can be passed through to the client if it is not handled.  The selector can be an action specified in the input method's dictionary of keys and actions (i.e. an action specific to the input method) or one of the NSResponder action methods such as insertNewline: or deleteBackward:.  By definition such action methods do not return a value.  For that reason if you implement this method you should test if it is appropriate to call the action method before calling it since calling the action method is agreeing to handle the command
				
			For example.  Suppose you have implemented a version of insertNewline: that terminates the conversion session and sends the fully converted text to the client.  However, if you conversion buffer is empty you want the application to receive the return key that triggered the call to insertNewline:.  In that case when didCommandBySelector:client: is called you should test your buffer before calling your implementation of insertNewline:.  If the buffer is empty you would return NO indicating that the return key should be passed on to the application.  If the buffer is not empty you would call insertNewline: and then return YES as the result of didCommandBySelector:client:.

    			A composed string refers to the buffer that an input method typically maintains to mirror the text contained in the active inline area.  It is called the composed string to reflect the fact that the input method composed the string by converting the characters input by the user.  In addition, using the term composed string makes it easier to differentiate between an input method's buffer and the text in the active inline area that the user sees. The returned object should be an autoreleased object.

.SS "New bitwise operators"
.IX Subsection "New bitwise operators"
A new experimental facility has been added that makes the four standard
bitwise operators (\f(CW\*(C`& | ^ ~\*(C'\fR) treat their operands consistently as
numbers, and introduces four new dotted operators (\f(CW\*(C`&. |. ^. ~.\*(C'\fR) that
treat their operands consistently as strings.  The same applies to the
assignment variants (\f(CW\*(C`&= |= ^= &.= |.= ^.=\*(C'\fR).
.PP
To use this, enable the \*(L"bitwise\*(R" feature and disable the
\&\*(L"experimental::bitwise\*(R" warnings category.  See \*(L"Bitwise String
Operators\*(R" in perlop for details.

.SS "New double-diamond operator"
.IX Subsection "New double-diamond operator"
\&\f(CW\*(C`<<>>\*(C'\fR is like \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR but uses three-argument \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR to open
each file in \f(CW@ARGV\fR.  This means that each element of \f(CW@ARGV\fR will be treated
as an actual file name, and \f(CW"|foo"\fR won't be treated as a pipe open.

.IX Subsection "qr/b{gcb}/"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`gcb\*(C'\fR stands for Grapheme Cluster Boundary.  It is a Unicode property
that finds the boundary between sequences of characters that look like a
single character to a native speaker of a language.  Perl has long had
the ability to deal with these through the \f(CW\*(C`\eX\*(C'\fR regular escape
sequence.  Now, there is an alternative way of handling these.  See
\&\*(L"\eb{}, \eb, \eB{}, \eB\*(R" in perlrebackslash for details.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`qr/\eb{wb}/\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "qr/b{wb}/"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`wb\*(C'\fR stands for Word Boundary.  It is a Unicode property
that finds the boundary between words.  This is similar to the plain
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eb\*(C'\fR (without braces) but is more suitable for natural language
processing.  It knows, for example, that apostrophes can occur in the
middle of words.  See \*(L"\eb{}, \eb, \eB{}, \eB\*(R" in perlrebackslash for details.

See \*(L"\eb{}, \eb, \eB{}, \eB\*(R" in perlrebackslash for details.
.SS "Non-Capturing Regular Expression Flag"
.IX Subsection "Non-Capturing Regular Expression Flag"
Regular expressions now support a \f(CW\*(C`/n\*(C'\fR flag that disables capturing
and filling in \f(CW$1\fR, \f(CW$2\fR, etc inside of groups:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  "hello" =~ /(hi|hello)/n; # $1 is not set
.Ve
.PP
This is equivalent to putting \f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR at the beginning of every capturing group.

.ie n .SS """use re \*(Aqstrict\*(Aq"""
.el .SS "\f(CWuse re \*(Aqstrict\*(Aq\fP"
.IX Subsection "use re strict"
This applies stricter syntax rules to regular expression patterns
compiled within its scope. This will hopefully alert you to typos and
other unintentional behavior that backwards-compatibility issues prevent
us from reporting in normal regular expression compilations.  Because the
behavior of this is subject to change in future Perl releases as we gain
experience, using this pragma will raise a warning of category
\&\f(CW\*(C`experimental::re_strict\*(C'\fR.
See 'strict' in re.

The version of Unicode 7.0 that comes with Perl includes
a correction dealing with glyph shaping in Arabic
(see <http://www.unicode.org/errata/#current_errata>).
.ie n .SS """use\ locale"" can restrict which locale categories are affected"
.el .SS "\f(CWuse\ locale\fP can restrict which locale categories are affected"
.IX Subsection "uselocale can restrict which locale categories are affected"
It is now possible to pass a parameter to \f(CW\*(C`use\ locale\*(C'\fR to specify
a subset of locale categories to be locale-aware, with the remaining
ones unaffected.  See \*(L"The \*(R"use locale\*(L" pragma\*(R" in perllocale for details.
.SS "Perl now supports \s-1POSIX 2008\s0 locale currency additions"
.IX Subsection "Perl now supports POSIX 2008 locale currency additions"
On platforms that are able to handle \s-1POSIX.1\-2008,\s0 the
hash returned by
\&\f(CW\*(C`POSIX::localeconv()\*(C'\fR
includes the international currency fields added by that version of the
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 standard.  These are
\&\f(CW\*(C`int_n_cs_precedes\*(C'\fR,

.SS "Better heuristics on older platforms for determining locale UTF\-8ness"
.IX Subsection "Better heuristics on older platforms for determining locale UTF-8ness"
On platforms that implement neither the C99 standard nor the \s-1POSIX 2001\s0
standard, determining if the current locale is \s-1UTF\-8\s0 or not depends on
heuristics.  These are improved in this release.
.SS "Aliasing via reference"
.IX Subsection "Aliasing via reference"
Variables and subroutines can now be aliased by assigning to a reference:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    \e$c = \e$d;
\&    \e&x = \e&y;
.Ve
.PP
Aliasing can also be accomplished
by using a backslash before a \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR iterator variable; this is
perhaps the most useful idiom this feature provides:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    foreach \e%hash (@array_of_hash_refs) { ... }
.Ve
.PP
This feature is experimental and must be enabled via \f(CW\*(C`use\ feature\ \*(Aqrefaliasing\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.  It will warn unless the \f(CW\*(C`experimental::refaliasing\*(C'\fR
warnings category is disabled.

.el .SS "New \f(CW:const\fP subroutine attribute"
.IX Subsection "New :const subroutine attribute"
The \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR attribute can be applied to an anonymous subroutine.  It
causes the new sub to be executed immediately whenever one is created
(\fIi.e.\fR when the \f(CW\*(C`sub\*(C'\fR expression is evaluated).  Its value is captured
and used to create a new constant subroutine that is returned.  This
feature is experimental.  See \*(L"Constant Functions\*(R" in perlsub.
.ie n .SS """fileno"" now works on directory handles"
.el .SS "\f(CWfileno\fP now works on directory handles"
.IX Subsection "fileno now works on directory handles"
When the relevant support is available in the operating system, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`fileno\*(C'\fR builtin now works on directory handles, yielding the
underlying file descriptor in the same way as for filehandles. On
operating systems without such support, \f(CW\*(C`fileno\*(C'\fR on a directory handle
continues to return the undefined value, as before, but also sets \f(CW$!\fR to
indicate that the operation is not supported.
.PP
Currently, this uses either a \f(CW\*(C`dd_fd\*(C'\fR member in the \s-1OS\s0 \f(CW\*(C`DIR\*(C'\fR
structure, or a \f(CWdirfd(3)\fR function as specified by \s-1POSIX.1\-2008.\s0
.SS "List form of pipe open implemented for Win32"
.IX Subsection "List form of pipe open implemented for Win32"
The list form of pipe:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  open my $fh, "\-|", "program", @arguments;
.Ve
.PP
is now implemented on Win32.  It has the same limitations as \f(CW\*(C`system
LIST\*(C'\fR on Win32, since the Win32 \s-1API\s0 doesn't accept program arguments
as a list.
.SS "Assignment to list repetition"
.IX Subsection "Assignment to list repetition"
\&\f(CW\*(C`(...) x ...\*(C'\fR can now be used within a list that is assigned to, as long
as the left-hand side is a valid lvalue.  This allows \f(CW\*(C`(undef,undef,$foo)\ =\ that_function()\*(C'\fR to be written as \f(CW\*(C`((undef)x2,\ $foo)\ =\ that_function()\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Infinity and NaN (not-a-number) handling improved"
.IX Subsection "Infinity and NaN (not-a-number) handling improved"
Floating point values are able to hold the special values infinity, negative
infinity, and NaN (not-a-number).  Now we more robustly recognize and
propagate the value in computations, and on output normalize them to the strings
\&\f(CW\*(C`Inf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-Inf\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`NaN\*(C'\fR.
.PP
See also the \s-1POSIX\s0 enhancements.
.SS "Floating point parsing has been improved"
.IX Subsection "Floating point parsing has been improved"
Parsing and printing of floating point values has been improved.
.PP
As a completely new feature, hexadecimal floating point literals
(like \f(CW\*(C`0x1.23p\-4\*(C'\fR)  are now supported, and they can be output with
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\ "%a"\*(C'\fR. See \*(L"Scalar value constructors\*(R" in perldata for more
details.
.SS "Packing infinity or not-a-number into a character is now fatal"
.IX Subsection "Packing infinity or not-a-number into a character is now fatal"
Before, when trying to pack infinity or not-a-number into a
(signed) character, Perl would warn, and assumed you tried to
pack \f(CW0xFF\fR; if you gave it as an argument to \f(CW\*(C`chr\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`U+FFFD\*(C'\fR was returned.
.PP
But now, all such actions (\f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`chr\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`print \*(Aq%c\*(Aq\*(C'\fR)
result in a fatal error.
.SS "Experimental C Backtrace \s-1API\s0"
.IX Subsection "Experimental C Backtrace API"
Perl now supports (via a C level \s-1API\s0) retrieving
the C level backtrace (similar to what symbolic debuggers like gdb do).
.PP
The backtrace returns the stack trace of the C call frames,
with the symbol names (function names), the object names (like \*(L"perl\*(R"),
and if it can, also the source code locations (file:line).
.PP
The supported platforms are Linux and \s-1OS X\s0 (some *BSD might work at
least partly, but they have not yet been tested).
.PP
The feature needs to be enabled with \f(CW\*(C`Configure \-Dusecbacktrace\*(C'\fR.

Perl has been compiled with the anti-stack-smashing option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-fstack\-protector\*(C'\fR since 5.10.1.  Now Perl uses the newer variant
called \f(CW\*(C`\-fstack\-protector\-strong\*(C'\fR, if available.

Critical bugfix: outside packages could be replaced.  Safe has
been patched to 2.38 to address this.

The 'code hardening' option called \f(CW\*(C`_FORTIFY_SOURCE\*(C'\fR, available in
gcc 4.*, is now always used for compiling Perl, if available.
.PP
Note that this isn't necessarily a huge step since in many platforms
the step had already been taken several years ago: many Linux
distributions (like Fedora) have been using this option for Perl,
and \s-1OS X\s0 has enforced the same for many years.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Subroutine signatures moved before attributes"
.IX Subsection "Subroutine signatures moved before attributes"
The experimental sub signatures feature, as introduced in 5.20, parsed
signatures after attributes. In this release, following feedback from users
of the experimental feature, the positioning has been moved such that
signatures occur after the subroutine name (if any) and before the attribute
list (if any).

List slices now return an empty list only if the original list was empty

consistency, this is now changed to match what terminates comment lines
outside \f(CW\*(C`(?[\ ])\*(C'\fR, namely a \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR (even if escaped), which is the

This experimental feature allows set operations in regular expression patterns.
Prior to this, the intersection operator had the same precedence as the other
binary operators.  Now it has higher precedence.  This could lead to different
outcomes than existing code expects (though the documentation has always noted
that this change might happen, recommending fully parenthesizing the
expressions).  See \*(L"Extended Bracketed Character Classes\*(R" in perlrecharclass.

Really old Perl let you omit the \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR on array names and the \f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR on hash

Previously, the text, unlike almost everything else, always came out
based on the current underlying locale of the program.  (Also affected
on some systems is \f(CW"$^E"\fR.)  For programs that are unprepared to
handle locale differences, this can cause garbage text to be displayed.
It's better to display text that is translatable via some tool than
garbage text which is much harder to figure out.

The stringification of \f(CW$!\fR and \f(CW$^E\fR will have the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 flag set
when the text is actually non-ASCII \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  This will enable programs
that are set up to be locale-aware to properly output messages in the
user's native language.  Code that needs to continue the 5.20 and
earlier behavior can do the stringification within the scopes of both
\&\f(CW\*(C`use\ bytes\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`use\ locale\ ":messages"\*(C'\fR.  Within these two
scopes, no other Perl operations will
be affected by locale; only \f(CW$!\fR and \f(CW$^E\fR stringification.  The

This variable allows Perl scripts to be written in an encoding other than
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 or \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  However, it affects all modules globally, leading
to wrong answers and segmentation faults.  New scripts should be written

.SS "Use of non-graphic characters in single-character variable names"
.IX Subsection "Use of non-graphic characters in single-character variable names"
The syntax for single-character variable names is more lenient than
for longer variable names, allowing the one-character name to be a
punctuation character or even invisible (a non-graphic).  Perl v5.20
deprecated the ASCII-range controls as such a name.  Now, all
non-graphic characters that formerly were allowed are deprecated.
The practical effect of this occurs only when not under \f(CW\*(C`use\ utf8\*(C'\fR, and affects just the C1 controls (code points 0x80 through
0xFF), NO-BREAK \s-1SPACE,\s0 and \s-1SOFT HYPHEN.\s0

.el .SS "Inlining of \f(CWsub () { $var }\fP with observable side-effects"
.IX Subsection "Inlining of sub () { $var } with observable side-effects"
In many cases Perl makes \f(CW\*(C`sub\ ()\ {\ $var\ }\*(C'\fR into an inlinable constant
subroutine, capturing the value of \f(CW$var\fR at the time the \f(CW\*(C`sub\*(C'\fR expression
is evaluated.  This can break the closure behavior in those cases where
\&\f(CW$var\fR is subsequently modified, since the subroutine won't return the
changed value. (Note that this all only applies to anonymous subroutines
with an empty prototype (\f(CW\*(C`sub\ ()\*(C'\fR).)
.PP
This usage is now deprecated in those cases where the variable could be
modified elsewhere.  Perl detects those cases and emits a deprecation
warning.  Such code will likely change in the future and stop producing a
constant.
.PP
If your variable is only modified in the place where it is declared, then
Perl will continue to make the sub inlinable with no warnings.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub make_constant {
\&        my $var = shift;
\&        return sub () { $var }; # fine

\&        log_that_value($var); # could modify $var
\&        return sub () { $var }; # deprecated
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
In the second example above, detecting that \f(CW$var\fR is assigned to only once
is too hard to detect.  That it happens in a spot other than the \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR
declaration is enough for Perl to find it suspicious.
.PP
This deprecation warning happens only for a simple variable for the body of
the sub.  (A \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR block or \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR statement inside the sub is ignored,
because it does not become part of the sub's body.)  For more complex
cases, such as \f(CW\*(C`sub\ ()\ {\ do_something()\ if\ 0;\ $var\ }\*(C'\fR the behavior has
changed such that inlining does not happen if the variable is modifiable
elsewhere.  Such cases should be rare.
.ie n .SS "Use of multiple ""/x"" regexp modifiers"

.PP
.Vb 3

.Ve
.PP
That is, now \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR should only occur once in any string of contiguous
regular expression pattern modifiers.  We do not believe there are any
occurrences of this in all of \s-1CPAN.\s0  This is in preparation for a future

preceding it with a backslash (\f(CW"\e{"\fR) or enclosing it within square
brackets \f(CW"[{]"\fR, or by using \f(CW\*(C`\eQ\*(C'\fR; otherwise a deprecation warning
will be raised.  This was first announced as forthcoming in the v5.16

\&\f(CW\*(C`(...)x1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`("constant")x0\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`($scalar)x0\*(C'\fR are now optimised in list
context.  If the right-hand argument is a constant 1, the repetition
operator disappears.  If the right-hand argument is a constant 0, the whole
expression is optimised to the empty list, so long as the left-hand
argument is a simple scalar or constant.  (That is, \f(CW\*(C`(foo())x0\*(C'\fR is not
subject to this optimisation.)

In \f(CW"\eL..."\fR, \f(CW"\eQ..."\fR, etc., the extra \*(L"stringify\*(R" op is now optimised

Assignment to an empty list is now sometimes faster.  In particular, it
never calls \f(CW\*(C`FETCH\*(C'\fR on tied arguments on the right-hand side, whereas it

There is a performance improvement of up to 20% when \f(CW\*(C`length\*(C'\fR is applied to

In \f(CW\*(C`@array = split\*(C'\fR, the assignment can be optimized away, so that \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR

Moreover, \f(CW\*(C`join\*(C'\fR with a scalar or constant for the separator and a
single-item list to join is simplified to a stringification, and the
separator doesn't even get evaluated.

\&\f(CW\*(C`qq(@array)\*(C'\fR is implemented using two ops: a stringify op and a join op.

Bad symbol for scalar
.Sp
(P) An internal request asked to add a scalar entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Can't use a hash as a reference
.Sp
(F) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
\&\f(CW\*(C`%foo\->{"bar"}\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`%$ref\->{"hello"}\*(C'\fR.  Versions of perl <= 5.6.1
used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.

Can't use an array as a reference
.Sp
(F) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
\&\f(CW\*(C`@foo\->[23]\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`@$ref\->[99]\*(C'\fR.  Versions of perl <= 5.6.1 used to
allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Can't use 'defined(@array)' (Maybe you should just omit the \fBdefined()\fR?)
.Sp
(F) \f(CW\*(C`defined()\*(C'\fR is not useful on arrays because it
checks for an undefined \fIscalar\fR value.  If you want to see if the
array is empty, just use \f(CW\*(C`if\ (@array)\ {\ #\ not\ empty\ }\*(C'\fR for example.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Can't use 'defined(%hash)' (Maybe you should just omit the \fBdefined()\fR?)
.Sp
(F) \f(CW\*(C`defined()\*(C'\fR is not usually right on hashes.
.Sp
Although \f(CW\*(C`defined\ %hash\*(C'\fR is false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it
becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including iterators,
weak references, stash names, even remaining true after \f(CW\*(C`undef\ %hash\*(C'\fR.
These things make \f(CW\*(C`defined\ %hash\*(C'\fR fairly useless in practice, so it now
generates a fatal error.
.Sp
If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it in boolean
context (see \*(L"Scalar values\*(R" in perldata):
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    if (%hash) {
\&       # not empty

.Ve
.Sp
If you had \f(CW\*(C`defined\ %Foo::Bar::QUUX\*(C'\fR to check whether such a package
variable exists then that's never really been reliable, and isn't
a good way to enquire about the features of a package, or whether
it's loaded, etc.

charnames alias definitions may not contain a sequence of multiple spaces
.Sp
(F) You defined a character name which had multiple space
characters in a row.  Change them to single spaces.  Usually these
names are defined in the \f(CW\*(C`:alias\*(C'\fR import argument to \f(CW\*(C`use charnames\*(C'\fR, but
they could be defined by a translator installed into \f(CW$^H{charnames}\fR.

defined in the \f(CW\*(C`:alias\*(C'\fR import argument to \f(CW\*(C`use charnames\*(C'\fR, but they

.IP "\(bu" 4
:const is not permitted on named subroutines
.Sp
(F) The \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR attribute causes an anonymous subroutine to be run and
its value captured at the time that it is cloned.  Named subroutines are
not cloned like this, so the attribute does not make sense on them.

Invalid quantifier in {,} in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/

(F) The pattern looks like a {min,max} quantifier, but the min or max could not
be parsed as a valid number: either it has leading zeroes, or it represents
too big a number to cope with.  The <\-\-\ \s-1HERE\s0 shows where in the regular

Missing or undefined argument to require
.Sp
(F) You tried to call \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR with no argument or with an undefined

.Sp
(W regexp) (only under \f(CW\*(C`use\ re\ \*(Aqstrict\*(Aq\*(C'\fR or within \f(CW\*(C`(?[...])\*(C'\fR)
.Sp
In a bracketed character class in a regular expression pattern, you
had a range which has exactly one end of it specified using \f(CW\*(C`\eN{}\*(C'\fR, and
the other end is specified using a non-portable mechanism.  Perl treats
the range as a Unicode range, that is, all the characters in it are
considered to be the Unicode characters, and which may be different code
points on some platforms Perl runs on.  For example, \f(CW\*(C`[\eN{U+06}\-\ex08]\*(C'\fR
is treated as if you had instead said \f(CW\*(C`[\eN{U+06}\-\eN{U+08}]\*(C'\fR, that is it
matches the characters whose code points in Unicode are 6, 7, and 8.
But that \f(CW\*(C`\ex08\*(C'\fR might indicate that you meant something different, so
the warning gets raised.

(W locale) You are 1) running under "\f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR"; 2) the current

(You can force portability by specifying a Unicode range, which means that

Wide character (U+%X) in \f(CW%s\fR
.Sp
(W locale) While in a single-byte locale (\fIi.e.\fR, a non\-UTF\-8
one), a multi-byte character was encountered.   Perl considers this
character to be the specified Unicode code point.  Combining non\-UTF\-8
locales and Unicode is dangerous.  Almost certainly some characters
will have two different representations.  For example, in the \s-1ISO 8859\-7\s0
(Greek) locale, the code point 0xC3 represents a Capital Gamma.  But so
also does 0x393.  This will make string comparisons unreliable.
.Sp
You likely need to figure out how this multi-byte character got mixed up
with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you had a \s-1UTF\-8\s0
locale, but Perl disagrees).

Experimental support has been added to allow ops in the optree to locate
their parent, if any. This is enabled by the non-default build option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR. It is envisaged that this will eventually become
enabled by default, so \s-1XS\s0 code which directly accesses the \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling\*(C'\fR
field of ops should be updated to be future-proofed.
.Sp
On \f(CW\*(C`PERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR builds, the \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling\*(C'\fR field has been renamed
\&\f(CW\*(C`op_sibparent\*(C'\fR and a new flag, \f(CW\*(C`op_moresib\*(C'\fR, added. On the last op in a
sibling chain, \f(CW\*(C`op_moresib\*(C'\fR is false and \f(CW\*(C`op_sibparent\*(C'\fR points to the
parent (if any) rather than being \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
To make existing code work transparently whether using \f(CW\*(C`PERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR
or not, a number of new macros and functions have been added that should
be used, rather than directly manipulating \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
For the case of just reading \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling\*(C'\fR to determine the next sibling,
two new macros have been added. A simple scan through a sibling chain
like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    for (; kid\->op_sibling; kid = kid\->op_sibling) { ... }
.Ve
.Sp
should now be written as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    for (; OpHAS_SIBLING(kid); kid = OpSIBLING(kid)) { ... }
.Ve
.Sp
For altering optrees, a general-purpose function \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling_splice()\*(C'\fR
has been added, which allows for manipulation of a chain of sibling ops.
By analogy with the Perl function \f(CW\*(C`splice()\*(C'\fR, it allows you to cut out
zero or more ops from a sibling chain and replace them with zero or more
new ops.  It transparently handles all the updating of sibling, parent,
op_last pointers etc.
.Sp
If you need to manipulate ops at a lower level, then three new macros,
\&\f(CW\*(C`OpMORESIB_set\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`OpLASTSIB_set\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`OpMAYBESIB_set\*(C'\fR are intended to
be a low-level portable way to set \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`op_sibparent\*(C'\fR while
also updating \f(CW\*(C`op_moresib\*(C'\fR.  The first sets the sibling pointer to a new
sibling, the second makes the op the last sibling, and the third
conditionally does the first or second action.  Note that unlike
\&\f(CW\*(C`op_sibling_splice()\*(C'\fR these macros won't maintain consistency in the
parent at the same time (\fIe.g.\fR by updating \f(CW\*(C`op_first\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`op_last\*(C'\fR where
appropriate).
.Sp
A C\-level \f(CW\*(C`Perl_op_parent()\*(C'\fR function and a Perl-level \f(CW\*(C`B::OP::parent()\*(C'\fR
method have been added. The C function only exists under
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR builds (using it is build-time error on vanilla
perls).  \f(CW\*(C`B::OP::parent()\*(C'\fR exists always, but on a vanilla build it
always returns \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR. Under \f(CW\*(C`PERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR, they return the parent
of the current op, if any. The variable \f(CW$B::OP::does_parent\fR allows you
to determine whether \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR supports retrieving an op's parent.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR was introduced in 5.21.2, but the interface was

Perl now tries to keep the locale category \f(CW\*(C`LC_NUMERIC\*(C'\fR set to \*(L"C\*(R"
except around operations that need it to be set to the program's
underlying locale.  This protects the many \s-1XS\s0 modules that cannot cope
with the decimal radix character not being a dot.  Prior to this
release, Perl initialized this category to \*(L"C\*(R", but a call to
\&\f(CW\*(C`POSIX::setlocale()\*(C'\fR would change it.  Now such a call will change the
underlying locale of the \f(CW\*(C`LC_NUMERIC\*(C'\fR category for the program, but the
locale exposed to \s-1XS\s0 code will remain \*(L"C\*(R".  There are new macros
to manipulate the \s-1LC_NUMERIC\s0 locale, including
\&\f(CW\*(C`STORE_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED\*(C'\fR and

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0 community for
helping Perl to flourish.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
<https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
\&\s-1CPAN.\s0

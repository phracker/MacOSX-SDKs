rewriting or deleting. The build process was overhauled during the 5.19
development track and the current instructions as of that time are given
in \*(L"\s-1CURRENT BUILD INSTRUCTIONS\*(R"\s0; the previous build instructions, which
are largely superseded but may still contain some useful information, are
left in \*(L"\s-1OLD BUILD INSTRUCTIONS\*(R"\s0 but really need removing after anything

\&\fIminiperl\fR is built. This is a single executable (without \s-1DLL\s0), intended
to run on Win32, and it will facilitate remaining build process; all binaries
built after it are foreign and should not run locally.
.Sp
\&\fIminiperl\fR is built using \fI./win32/Makefile\fR; this is part of normal
build process invoked as dependency from wince/Makefile.ce
.IP "\(bu" 4
After \fIminiperl\fR is built, \fIconfigpm\fR is invoked to create right \fIConfig.pm\fR
in right place and its corresponding Cross.pm.
.Sp
Unlike Win32 build, miniperl will not have \fIConfig.pm\fR of host within reach;
it rather will use \fIConfig.pm\fR from within cross-compilation directories.
.Sp
File \fICross.pm\fR is dead simple: for given cross-architecture places in \f(CW@INC\fR
a path where perl modules are, and right \fIConfig.pm\fR in that place.
.Sp
That said, \f(CW\*(C`miniperl \-Ilib \-MConfig \-we 1\*(C'\fR should report an error, because
it can not find \fIConfig.pm\fR. If it does not give an error \*(-- wrong \fIConfig.pm\fR
is substituted, and resulting binaries will be a mess.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`miniperl \-MCross \-MConfig \-we 1\*(C'\fR should run okay, and it will provide right
\&\fIConfig.pm\fR for further compilations.
.IP "\(bu" 4
During extensions build phase, a script \fI./win32/buildext.pl\fR is invoked,
which in turn steps in \fI./ext\fR subdirectories and performs a build of
each extension in turn.
.Sp
All invokes of \fIMakefile.PL\fR are provided with \f(CW\*(C`\-MCross\*(C'\fR so to enable cross\-
compile.

7. Open another command prompt, ensure \s-1PLATFORM\s0 is not set to anything

8. In the WinCE command prompt you made with \s-1WCEARMV4.BAT,\s0 goto the perl 
source directory, cd into win32/ and run \*(L"nmake \-f Makefile.ce\*(R".

9. The \s-1ARM\s0 perl interpreter (perl519.dll and perl.exe) will be in something

\fIMake\fR
.IX Subsection "Make"
.PP
Normally you only need to edit \fI./win32/ce\-helpers/compile.bat\fR
to reflect your system and run it.
.PP
File \fI./win32/ce\-helpers/compile.bat\fR is actually a wrapper to call
\&\f(CW\*(C`nmake \-f makefile.ce\*(C'\fR with appropriate parameters and it accepts extra
parameters and forwards them to \f(CW\*(C`nmake\*(C'\fR command as additional
arguments. You should pass target this way.
.PP
To prepare distribution you need to do following:
.IP "\(bu" 4
go to \fI./win32\fR subdirectory
.IP "\(bu" 4
edit file \fI./win32/ce\-helpers/compile.bat\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
run 
  compile.bat
.IP "\(bu" 4
run 
  compile.bat dist
.PP
\&\fIMakefile.ce\fR has \f(CW\*(C`CROSS_NAME\*(C'\fR macro, and it is used further to refer to
your cross-compilation scheme. You could assign a name to it, but this
is not necessary, because by default it is assigned after your machine
configuration name, such as \*(L"wince\-sh3\-hpc\-wce211\*(R", and this is enough
to distinguish different builds at the same time. This option could be
handy for several different builds on same platform to perform, say,
threaded build. In a following example we assume that all required
environment variables are set properly for C cross-compiler (a special
*.bat file could fit perfectly to this purpose) and your \fIcompile.bat\fR
has proper \*(L"\s-1MACHINE\*(R"\s0 parameter set, to, say, \f(CW\*(C`wince\-mips\-pocket\-wce300\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  compile.bat
\&  compile.bat dist
\&  compile.bat CROSS_NAME=mips\-wce300\-thr "USE_ITHREADS=define" ^

.Ve
.PP
If all goes okay and no errors during a build, you'll get two independent
distributions: \f(CW\*(C`wince\-mips\-pocket\-wce300\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`mips\-wce300\-thr\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Target \f(CW\*(C`dist\*(C'\fR prepares distribution file set. Target \f(CW\*(C`zipdist\*(C'\fR performs
same as \f(CW\*(C`dist\*(C'\fR but additionally compresses distribution files into zip
archive.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 during a build there could be created a number (or one) of \fIConfig.pm\fR
for cross-compilation (\*(L"foreign\*(R" \fIConfig.pm\fR) and those are hidden inside
\&\fI../xlib/$(\s-1CROSS_NAME\s0)\fR with other auxiliary files, but, and this is important to
note, there should be \fBno\fR \fIConfig.pm\fR for host miniperl.
If you'll get an error that perl could not find Config.pm somewhere in building
process this means something went wrong. Most probably you forgot to
specify a cross-compilation when invoking miniperl.exe to Makefile.PL
When building an extension for cross-compilation your command line should
look like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ..\eminiperl.exe \-I..\elib \-MCross=mips\-wce300\-thr Makefile.PL
.Ve
.PP
or just
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ..\eminiperl.exe \-I..\elib \-MCross Makefile.PL
.Ve
.PP
to refer a cross-compilation that was created last time.

PerlCE is currently linked with a simple console window, so it also
works on non-hpc devices.
.PP
The simple stdio implementation creates the files \fIstdin.txt\fR,
\&\fIstdout.txt\fR and \fIstderr.txt\fR, so you might examine them if your
console has only a limited number of cols.
.PP
When exitcode is non-zero, a message box appears, otherwise the
console closes, so you might have to catch an exit with
status 0 in your program to see any output.

stdout/stderr now go into the files \fI/perl\-stdout.txt\fR and

The port for Win32 was used as a reference.

.IX Item "5.6.0"
Initial port of perl to WinCE. It was performed in separate directory
named \fIwince\fR. This port was based on contents of \fI./win32\fR directory.
\&\fIminiperl\fR was not built, user must have \s-1HOST\s0 perl and properly edit
\&\fImakefile.ce\fR to reflect this.
.IP "5.8.0" 4
.IX Item "5.8.0"
wince port was kept in the same \fI./wince\fR directory, and \fIwince/Makefile.ce\fR
was used to invoke native compiler to create \s-1HOST\s0 miniperl, which then
facilitates cross-compiling process.
Extension building support was added.
.IP "5.9.4" 4
.IX Item "5.9.4"
Two directories \fI./win32\fR and \fI./wince\fR were merged, so perlce build
process comes in \fI./win32\fR directory.

provided initial port of Perl, which appears to be most essential work, as
it was a breakthrough on having Perl ported at all.
Many thanks and obligations to Rainer!

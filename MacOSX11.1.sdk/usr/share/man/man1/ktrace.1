.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can configure the system to trace events, or record them to a file, and print a
human-readable representation of the events.
.
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
.Nm
uses a subcommand syntax to separate different functionality into logical
groups.
Each subcommand takes its own set of options, though a few options may be used
in multiple subcommands.
.Bl -tag -width "disable -"
.\" INFO
.It Cm info
Print information about the current configuration of kernel trace.
.\" TRACE
.It Xo
.Cm trace
.trace-opts
.Xc
.Pp
Print events to
.Xr stdout 4
in a human-readable format, automatically providing wall clock time, process
names, and event names for each event.
Without the
.Fl R
or
.Fl E
options,
.Nm
initializes the trace buffers to a reasonable size and enables tracing until it
terminates.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl R Ar path
Print events from the trace file at
.Ar path .
.It Fl E
Use an existing configuration, instead of creating a new configuration.
This is necessary to use the
.Cm trace
subcommand with other
.Nm
subcommands, like
.Cm init
and
.Cm setopt .
.It Fl N
Don't display names of events.
.It Fl C
Print timestamps in continuous time.
.It Fl n
Display thread names.
.It Fl r
Just configure and start trace running in windowed or ring buffer mode -- do
not print the events.
.Nm Cm trace Fl E
can later be used to read the in-memory events.
.It Fl S
Print arguments as strings for tracepoints known to include strings
.It Fl s
Attempt to symbolicate addresses found in arguments to symbols.
.It Fl t
Print times as Mach absolute timestamps, instead of the default local wall clock
time.
.It Fl A
Print times as seconds since the start of trace.
.It Fl u
Attempt to symbolicate addressess to uuid-offset tuples.
.It Fl C Ar codes-path
Use a custom codes file to provide event ID to name mappings.
See
.Xr trace 1
for more details on the format of codes files.
.It Fl b Ar buffer-size-mb
Set a custom buffer size in megabytes.
.It Fl f Ar filter-desc
Apply a filter description to the trace session, controlling which events are
traced.
See
.Sx FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
for details on the syntax of a filter.
If no filter description is provided, all events will be traced.
.It Fl T Ar timeout
End tracing after
.Ar timeout
has elapsed.
Suffixes like
.Li ns
or
.Li ms
are supported, but seconds are the default if just a number is supplied.
.It Fl x Ar pid-or-process-name Oo Ar ... Oc | Fl p Ar pid-or-process-name Oo Ar ... Oc
Restrict the processes that can trace events.
Either exclude
.Pq Fl x
or only trace events
.Pq Fl p
from the provided processes by name or pid.
These options are mutually exlusive.
Processes that cannot be attached to are always excluded on release kernels.
Similarly, events in the Mach scheduling subclass are included, regardless of
the this option, to allow tools to maintain thread scheduling state machines.
.It Fl Fl json
Print events as an array of JSON objects.
.It Fl Fl csv
Print events as CSV entries.
.It Fl Fl ndjson
Print events as a stream of newline-delimited JSON objects.
.It Fl Fl json-64
Print events as JSON objects, with 64-bit numbers.
.It Fl c Ar command Op ...
Run the command specified by
.Ar command
and stop tracing when it exits.
All arguments after this option are passed to the command.

.\" DUMP
.It Cm dump Oo Fl E Oc Oo Fl f Ar filter-desc Oc Oo Fl l Ar compression-level Oc Oo Fl T Ar timeout Oc Oo Fl Fl stackshot-flags Ar extra-flags Oc Oo Ar path Oc Oo Fl p Ar pid-or-process-name Oc
.Pp
Write trace to a file at
.Ar path
for later inspection with
.Nm
.Cm trace Fl R .
If no
.Ar path
is specified, the tool writes to a new, numbered file in the working directory,
starting with
.Li trace001.ktrace .
The command continues to write events until
.Nm
is terminated, the optional timeout triggers, or the trace buffers fill up when
using an existing configuration with wrapping disabled.
If a compression level is specified, the file is compressed as it is written.
Using non-default values for this option may increase the overhead of collecting
events.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl E
Use an existing configuration, instead of creating a new configuration.
.It Fl f Ar filter-desc
Apply a filter description to events written to the file, controlling which
events are traced.
See
.Sx FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
for details on the syntax of a filter.
If no filter description is provided, all events will be traced.
.It Fl p Ar pid-or-process-name
Only record events that occur for the process identified by
.Ar pid
or
.Ar process-name .
Only the first 16 characters of the name are observed, due to a kernel
limitation.
.Sx FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
for details on the syntax of a filter.
If no filter description is provided, all events will be traced.
.It Fl p
Enable kperf sampling.
.It Fl T Ar timeout
End tracing after
.Ar timeout
has elapsed.
Suffixes like
.Li ns
or
.Li ms
are supported, but seconds are the default if just a number is supplied.
.It Fl Fl stackshot-flags Ar extra-flags
Pass the provided
.Ar extra-flags
integer as additional flags when recording stackshots.
.El
.\" INIT
.It Cm init Fl b Ar buffer-size-mb | Fl n Ar n-events
.Pp
Initialize trace to allocate
.Ar buffer-size-mb
megabytes of space or
.Ar n-events
events for its trace buffers.
This subcommand must be provided before using the
.Cm setopt ,
.Cm enable ,
or
.Cm disable
subcommands initially or after using the
.Cm remove
subcommand.
.\" SETOPT
.It Cm setopt Oo Fl f Ar filter-desc Oc Oo Fl w Oc Oo Fl x Ar pid-or-process-name Oo Ar ... Oc | Fl p Ar pid-or-process-name Oo Ar ... Oc Oc
.Pp
Set options on the existing trace configuration.
The trace configuration must already be initialized.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar filter-desc
Apply a filter description to the current configuration, controlling which
events are traced.
See
.Sx FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
for details on the syntax of a filter.
If no filter description is provided, all events will be traced.
.It Fl w
Configure trace to operate in
.Dq windowed
mode, where the trace buffer acts as a ring buffer, removing old events to make
room for new ones.
By default, tracing ends when the buffer runs out of space for new events.
.It Fl x Ar pid-or-process-name Oo Ar ... Oc | Fl p Ar pid-or-process-name Oo Ar ... Oc
Restrict the processes that can trace events.
Either exclude
.Pq Fl x
or only trace events
.Pq Fl p
from the provided processes by name or pid.
These options are mutually exlusive.
Processes that cannot be attached to are always excluded on release kernels.
Similarly, events in the Mach scheduling subclass are included, regardless of
the this option, to allow tools to maintain thread scheduling state machines.
.El
.\" ENABLE
.It Cm enable
Start tracing events.
.\" DISABLE
.It Cm disable
Stop tracing events.
Tracing can be started again after it has been disabled, using the same
configuration.
.\" REMOVE
.It Cm remove
Remove the current trace configuration and free the memory associated with
tracing.
.\" RESET
.It Cm reset
Reset tracing and associated subsystems, including kperf, to their default
state.
.\" DECODE
.It Cm decode Ar debugid Op debugid Op Ar ...
Print the components that make up the provided
.Ar debugids .
.\" EMIT
.It Cm emit Ar debugid Op arg1 Op arg2 Op arg3 Op arg4

Oc Oc
Profile the system, writing trace events to an automatically named file.
By default, this measures scheduler, VM, and system call usage, and samples
threads on-core periodically.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar path
Specify the name of the file to be created.
.It Fl f Ar filter-desc
Trace the classes and subclasses specified by the filter description.
See
.Sx FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
for details on the syntax of a filter.
.It Fl F Ar filter-desc
Exclude events from the default set.
Use this options with care, since analysis tools may rely on certain events
being present.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Stop tracing and exit after
.Ar timeout
option is provided, stop tracing and exit after
.Ar timeout
has elapsed.
The timeout value may have
.Li us ,
.Li ms ,
or
.Li s
appended to indicate the time units.
.It Fl i Ar interval
Set the interval that the profiling timer fires
.Po supports the same time suffixes as
.Fl t
.Pc .
.It Fl n
Disable the profiling timer entirely.
.It Fl b Ar buffer-size-mb
Set the trace buffer size.
.It Fl r
Configure tracing and leave it running in ring buffer mode.
.It Fl p Ar pid-or-process-name
Only record events that occur for the process identified by
.Ar pid
or
.Ar process-name .
Only the first 16 characters of the name are observed, due to a kernel
limitation.
.It Fl d Ar group
Disable the group named
.Ar group .
See
.Sx GROUPS
for a list of groups.
.It Fl e Ar group
Enable the group named
.Ar group .
See
.Sx GROUPS
for a list of groups.
.It Fl Fl remote Ns Op Ns = Ns Ar device-name
Also trace on the provided
.Ar device-name
or the local bridge if not specified.
.It Fl Fl type Ns = Ns Ar full Ns | Ns Ar profile Ns | Ns Ar lite Ns | Ns Ar morelite
Trace using the specified type.
.Ar full
is the default, while
.Ar profile
just enables the profiling timer, but does not closely track scheduling events.
The
.Ar lite
and
.Ar morelite
trace types are meant for long-running, low overhead analysis and prioritize
analyzing threads that are blocked for relatively long periods of time, at the
cost of an unbiased sample towards threads that cause a CPU to come out of idle.
.Pp
The
.Ql lite
modes work by lazily sampling threads as they are unblocked, and only those
threads that block for more than a set threshold.
Further, the typical profiling timer is disabled, in lieu of sampling the CPUs
opportunistically, on other interrupts.
The
.Ar morelite
mode has a more restrictive typefilter than
.Ar lite .
.It Fl Fl stackshot-flags Ar extra-flags
Pass the provided
.Ar extra-flags
integer as additional flags when recording stackshots.
.It Fl c Ar command Op ...
Run the command specified by
.Ar command
and stop tracing when it exits.
All arguments after this option are passed to
the command.
.It Fl Fl kperf Ns = Ns Ar sampler-name Ns Oo , Ns Ar sampler-name Oc Ns @ Ns Ar timer-period Ns | Ns Ar timer-frequency Ns | Ns Ar kdebug-filter-desc
Sample using kperf according to the given sampling description.
For the syntax of sampling descriptions, see
.Sx SAMPLING DESCRIPTIONS .
.El

.Sh FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
A filter description is a comma-separated list of class and subclass specifiers
that indicate which events should be traced.
A class specifier starts with
.Ql C
and contains a single byte, specified in either decimal or hex.
A subclass specifier starts with
.Ql S
and takes two bytes.
The high byte is the class and the low byte is the subclass of that class.
.Pp
For example, this filter description would enable classes 1 and 37 and the
subclasses 33 and 35 of class 5:
.Ql C1,C0x25,S0x0521,S0x0523 .
The
.Ql ALL
filter description enables events from all classes.
.Sh SAMPLING DESCRIPTIONS
A sampling description is similar to a filter description, but it configures
sampling.
It's composed of two parts: a samplers section and a trigger section, separated
by
.Li @ .
The overall form is
.Ar sampler-name Ns
.Op , Ns Ar sampler-name Ns
@ Ns
.Ar timer-period Ns | Ns
.Ar timer-frequency Ns | Ns
.Ar kdebug-filter-desc .
The valid names of samplers are
.Ql ustack ,
.Ql kstack ,
.Ql thinfo ,
.Ql thsnapshot ,
.Ql meminfo ,
.Ql thsched ,
.Ql thdispatch ,
.Ql tksnapshot ,
.Ql sysmem ,
and
.Ql thinstrscycles .
.Pp
For example, to sample user stacks every 10 milliseconds, use
.Ql ustack@10ms .
To sample thread scheduling information and system memory every time the
.Ql 0xfeedfac0
event is emitted, use
.Ql thsched,sysmem@D0xfeedfac0 .
.Sh GROUPS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It syscall-sampling
Sample backtraces on system calls.
.It fault-sampling
Sample backtraces on page faults.
.It graphics
Include graphics events.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.
.Sh CAVEATS
Once trace has been initialized with the
.Cm init
subcommand
.Po or the
.Cm trace
and
.Cm artrace
subcommands with the
.Fl r
flag
.Pc ,
it remains in use until the space is reclaimed with the
.Cm remove
subcommand.
This prevents background diagnostic tools from making use of trace.

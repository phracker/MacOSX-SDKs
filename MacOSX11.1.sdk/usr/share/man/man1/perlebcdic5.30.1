.SH "NAME"
perlebcdic \- Considerations for running Perl on EBCDIC platforms
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
An exploration of some of the issues facing Perl programmers
on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 based computers.
.PP
Portions of this document that are still incomplete are marked with \s-1XXX.\s0
.PP
Early Perl versions worked on some \s-1EBCDIC\s0 machines, but the last known
version that ran on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 was v5.8.7, until v5.22, when the Perl core
again works on z/OS.  Theoretically, it could work on \s-1OS/400\s0 or Siemens'
\&\s-1BS2000\s0  (or their successors), but this is untested.  In v5.22 and 5.24,
not all
the modules found on \s-1CPAN\s0 but shipped with core Perl work on z/OS.
.PP
If you want to use Perl on a non\-z/OS \s-1EBCDIC\s0 machine, please let us know
at <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.
.PP
Writing Perl on an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform is really no different than writing
on an \*(L"\s-1ASCII\*(R"\s0 one, but with different underlying numbers, as we'll see
shortly.  You'll have to know something about those \*(L"\s-1ASCII\*(R"\s0 platforms
because the documentation is biased and will frequently use example
numbers that don't apply to \s-1EBCDIC.\s0  There are also very few \s-1CPAN\s0
modules that are written for \s-1EBCDIC\s0 and which don't work on \s-1ASCII\s0;
instead the vast majority of \s-1CPAN\s0 modules are written for \s-1ASCII,\s0 and
some may happen to work on \s-1EBCDIC,\s0 while a few have been designed to
portably work on both.
.PP
If your code just uses the 52 letters A\-Z and a\-z, plus \s-1SPACE,\s0 the
digits 0\-9, and the punctuation characters that Perl uses, plus a few
controls that are denoted by escape sequences like \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\et\*(C'\fR, then
there's nothing special about using Perl, and your code may very well
work on an \s-1ASCII\s0 machine without change.
.PP
But if you write code that uses \f(CW\*(C`\e005\*(C'\fR to mean a \s-1TAB\s0 or \f(CW\*(C`\exC1\*(C'\fR to mean
an \*(L"A\*(R", or \f(CW\*(C`\exDF\*(C'\fR to mean a \*(L"y\*:\*(R" (small \f(CW"y"\fR with a diaeresis),
then your code may well work on your \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform, but not on an
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 one.  That's fine to do if no one will ever want to run your code
on an \s-1ASCII\s0 platform; but the bias in this document will be towards writing
code portable between \s-1EBCDIC\s0 and \s-1ASCII\s0 systems.  Again, if every
character you care about is easily enterable from your keyboard, you
don't have to know anything about \s-1ASCII,\s0 but many keyboards don't easily
allow you to directly enter, say, the character \f(CW\*(C`\exDF\*(C'\fR, so you have to
specify it indirectly, such as by using the \f(CW"\exDF"\fR escape sequence.
In those cases it's easiest to know something about the ASCII/Unicode
character sets.  If you know that the small \*(L"y\*:\*(R" is \f(CW\*(C`U+00FF\*(C'\fR, then
you can instead specify it as \f(CW"\eN{U+FF}"\fR, and have the computer
automatically translate it to \f(CW\*(C`\exDF\*(C'\fR on your platform, and leave it as
\&\f(CW\*(C`\exFF\*(C'\fR on \s-1ASCII\s0 ones.  Or you could specify it by name, \f(CW\*(C`\eN{LATIN
SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS\*(C'\fR and not have to know the  numbers.
Either way works, but both require familiarity with Unicode.
.SH "COMMON CHARACTER CODE SETS"
.IX Header "COMMON CHARACTER CODE SETS"
.SS "\s-1ASCII\s0"
.IX Subsection "ASCII"
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (\s-1ASCII\s0 or
US-ASCII) is a set of
integers running from 0 to 127 (decimal) that have standardized
interpretations by the computers which use \s-1ASCII.\s0  For example, 65 means
the letter \*(L"A\*(R".
The range 0..127 can be covered by setting various bits in a 7\-bit binary
digit, hence the set is sometimes referred to as \*(L"7\-bit \s-1ASCII\*(R".
ASCII\s0 was described by the American National Standards Institute
document \s-1ANSI X3.4\-1986.\s0  It was also described by \s-1ISO 646:1991\s0
(with localization for currency symbols).  The full \s-1ASCII\s0 set is
given in the table below as the first 128 elements.
Languages that
can be written adequately with the characters in \s-1ASCII\s0 include
English, Hawaiian, Indonesian, Swahili and some Native American
languages.
.PP
Most non-EBCDIC character sets are supersets of \s-1ASCII.\s0  That is the
integers 0\-127 mean what \s-1ASCII\s0 says they mean.  But integers 128 and
above are specific to the character set.
.PP
Many of these fit entirely into 8 bits, using \s-1ASCII\s0 as 0\-127, while
specifying what 128\-255 mean, and not using anything above 255.
Thus, these are single-byte (or octet if you prefer) character sets.
One important one (since Unicode is a superset of it) is the \s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0
character set.
.SS "\s-1ISO 8859\s0"
.IX Subsection "ISO 8859"
The \s-1ISO 8859\-\s0\fI\f(BI\f(CB$n\f(BI\fI\fR are a collection of character code sets from the
International Organization for Standardization (\s-1ISO\s0), each of which adds
characters to the \s-1ASCII\s0 set that are typically found in various
languages, many of which are based on the Roman, or Latin, alphabet.
Most are for European languages, but there are also ones for Arabic,
Greek, Hebrew, and Thai.  There are good references on the web about
all these.
.SS "Latin 1 (\s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0)"
.IX Subsection "Latin 1 (ISO 8859-1)"
A particular 8\-bit extension to \s-1ASCII\s0 that includes grave and acute
accented Latin characters.  Languages that can employ \s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0
include all the languages covered by \s-1ASCII\s0 as well as Afrikaans,
Albanian, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Faroese, Finnish, Norwegian,
Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.  Dutch is covered albeit without
the ij ligature.  French is covered too but without the oe ligature.
German can use \s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0 but must do so without German-style
quotation marks.  This set is based on Western European extensions
to \s-1ASCII\s0 and is commonly encountered in world wide web work.
In \s-1IBM\s0 character code set identification terminology, \s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0 is
also known as \s-1CCSID 819\s0 (or sometimes 0819 or even 00819).
.SS "\s-1EBCDIC\s0"
.IX Subsection "EBCDIC"
The Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code refers to a
large collection of single\- and multi-byte coded character sets that are
quite different from \s-1ASCII\s0 and \s-1ISO 8859\-1,\s0 and are all slightly
different from each other; they typically run on host computers.  The
\&\s-1EBCDIC\s0 encodings derive from 8\-bit byte extensions of Hollerith punched
card encodings, which long predate \s-1ASCII.\s0  The layout on the
cards was such that high bits were set for the upper and lower case
alphabetic
characters \f(CW\*(C`[a\-z]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[A\-Z]\*(C'\fR, but there were gaps within each Latin
alphabet range, visible in the table below.  These gaps can
cause complications.
.PP
Some \s-1IBM EBCDIC\s0 character sets may be known by character code set
identification numbers (\s-1CCSID\s0 numbers) or code page numbers.
.PP
Perl can be compiled on platforms that run any of three commonly used \s-1EBCDIC\s0
character sets, listed below.
.PP
\fIThe 13 variant characters\fR
.IX Subsection "The 13 variant characters"
.PP
Among \s-1IBM EBCDIC\s0 character code sets there are 13 characters that
are often mapped to different integer values.  Those characters
are known as the 13 \*(L"variant\*(R" characters and are:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \e [ ] { } ^ ~ ! # | $ @ \`
.Ve
.PP
When Perl is compiled for a platform, it looks at all of these characters to
guess which \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character set the platform uses, and adapts itself
accordingly to that platform.  If the platform uses a character set that is not
one of the three Perl knows about, Perl will either fail to compile, or
mistakenly and silently choose one of the three.
.PP
The Line Feed (\s-1LF\s0) character is actually a 14th variant character, and
Perl checks for that as well.
.PP
\fI\s-1EBCDIC\s0 code sets recognized by Perl\fR
.IX Subsection "EBCDIC code sets recognized by Perl"
.IP "\fB0037\fR" 4
.IX Item "0037"
Character code set \s-1ID 0037\s0 is a mapping of the \s-1ASCII\s0 plus Latin\-1
characters (i.e. \s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0) to an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 set.  0037 is used
in North American English locales on the \s-1OS/400\s0 operating system
that runs on \s-1AS/400\s0 computers.  \s-1CCSID 0037\s0 differs from \s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0
in 236 places; in other words they agree on only 20 code point values.
.IP "\fB1047\fR" 4
.IX Item "1047"
Character code set \s-1ID 1047\s0 is also a mapping of the \s-1ASCII\s0 plus
Latin\-1 characters (i.e. \s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0) to an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 set.  1047 is
used under Unix System Services for \s-1OS/390\s0 or z/OS, and OpenEdition
for \s-1VM/ESA.\s0  \s-1CCSID 1047\s0 differs from \s-1CCSID 0037\s0 in eight places,
and from \s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0 in 236.
.IP "\fBPOSIX-BC\fR" 4
.IX Item "POSIX-BC"
The \s-1EBCDIC\s0 code page in use on Siemens' \s-1BS2000\s0 system is distinct from
1047 and 0037.  It is identified below as the POSIX-BC set.
Like 0037 and 1047, it is the same as \s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0 in 20 code point
values.
.SS "Unicode code points versus \s-1EBCDIC\s0 code points"
.IX Subsection "Unicode code points versus EBCDIC code points"
In Unicode terminology a \fIcode point\fR is the number assigned to a
character: for example, in \s-1EBCDIC\s0 the character \*(L"A\*(R" is usually assigned
the number 193.  In Unicode, the character \*(L"A\*(R" is assigned the number 65.
All the code points in \s-1ASCII\s0 and Latin\-1 (\s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0) have the same
meaning in Unicode.  All three of the recognized \s-1EBCDIC\s0 code sets have
256 code points, and in each code set, all 256 code points are mapped to
equivalent Latin1 code points.  Obviously, \*(L"A\*(R" will map to \*(L"A\*(R", \*(L"B\*(R" =>
\&\*(L"B\*(R", \*(L"%\*(R" => \*(L"%\*(R", etc., for all printable characters in Latin1 and these
code pages.
.PP
It also turns out that \s-1EBCDIC\s0 has nearly precise equivalents for the
ASCII/Latin1 C0 controls and the \s-1DELETE\s0 control.  (The C0 controls are
those whose \s-1ASCII\s0 code points are 0..0x1F; things like \s-1TAB, ACK, BEL,\s0
etc.)  A mapping is set up between these \s-1ASCII/EBCDIC\s0 controls.  There
isn't such a precise mapping between the C1 controls on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms
and the remaining \s-1EBCDIC\s0 controls.  What has been done is to map these
controls, mostly arbitrarily, to some otherwise unmatched character in
the other character set.  Most of these are very very rarely used
nowadays in \s-1EBCDIC\s0 anyway, and their names have been dropped, without
much complaint.  For example the \s-1EO\s0 (Eight Ones) \s-1EBCDIC\s0 control
(consisting of eight one bits = 0xFF) is mapped to the C1 \s-1APC\s0 control
(0x9F), and you can't use the name \*(L"\s-1EO\*(R".\s0
.PP
The \s-1EBCDIC\s0 controls provide three possible line terminator characters,
\&\s-1CR\s0 (0x0D), \s-1LF\s0 (0x25), and \s-1NL\s0 (0x15).  On \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms, the symbols
\&\*(L"\s-1NL\*(R"\s0 and \*(L"\s-1LF\*(R"\s0 refer to the same character, but in strict \s-1EBCDIC\s0
terminology they are different ones.  The \s-1EBCDIC NL\s0 is mapped to the C1
control called \*(L"\s-1NEL\*(R"\s0 (\*(L"Next Line\*(R"; here's a case where the mapping makes
quite a bit of sense, and hence isn't just arbitrary).  On some \s-1EBCDIC\s0
platforms, this \s-1NL\s0 or \s-1NEL\s0 is the typical line terminator.  This is true
of z/OS and \s-1BS2000.\s0  In these platforms, the C compilers will swap the
\&\s-1LF\s0 and \s-1NEL\s0 code points, so that \f(CW"\en"\fR is 0x15, and refers to \s-1NL.\s0  Perl
does that too; you can see it in the code chart below.
This makes things generally \*(L"just work\*(R" without you even having to be
aware that there is a swap.
.SS "Unicode and \s-1UTF\s0"
.IX Subsection "Unicode and UTF"
\&\s-1UTF\s0 stands for \*(L"Unicode Transformation Format\*(R".
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 is an encoding of Unicode into a sequence of 8\-bit byte chunks, based on
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 and Latin\-1.
The length of a sequence required to represent a Unicode code point
depends on the ordinal number of that code point,
with larger numbers requiring more bytes.
UTF-EBCDIC is like \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 but based on \s-1EBCDIC.\s0
They are enough alike that often, casual usage will conflate the two
terms, and use \*(L"\s-1UTF\-8\*(R"\s0 to mean both the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 found on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms,
and the UTF-EBCDIC found on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 ones.
.PP
You may see the term \*(L"invariant\*(R" character or code point.
This simply means that the character has the same numeric
value and representation when encoded in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 (or UTF-EBCDIC) as when
not.  (Note that this is a very different concept from \*(L"The 13 variant
characters\*(R" mentioned above.  Careful prose will use the term \*(L"\s-1UTF\-8\s0
invariant\*(R" instead of just \*(L"invariant\*(R", but most often you'll see just
\&\*(L"invariant\*(R".) For example, the ordinal value of \*(L"A\*(R" is 193 in most
\&\s-1EBCDIC\s0 code pages, and also is 193 when encoded in UTF-EBCDIC.  All
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 (or UTF-EBCDIC) variant code points occupy at least two bytes when
encoded in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 (or UTF-EBCDIC); by definition, the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 (or
UTF-EBCDIC) invariant code points are exactly one byte whether encoded
in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 (or UTF-EBCDIC), or not.  (By now you see why people typically
just say \*(L"\s-1UTF\-8\*(R"\s0 when they also mean \*(L"UTF-EBCDIC\*(R".  For the rest of this
document, we'll mostly be casual about it too.)
In \s-1ASCII UTF\-8,\s0 the code points corresponding to the lowest 128
ordinal numbers (0 \- 127: the \s-1ASCII\s0 characters) are invariant.
In UTF-EBCDIC, there are 160 invariant characters.
(If you care, the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 invariants are those characters
which have \s-1ASCII\s0 equivalents, plus those that correspond to
the C1 controls (128 \- 159 on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms).)
.PP
A string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may be longer (very rarely shorter) than
one encoded in \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  Perl extends both \s-1UTF\-8\s0 and UTF-EBCDIC so that
they can encode code points above the Unicode maximum of U+10FFFF.  Both
extensions are constructed to allow encoding of any code point that fits
in a 64\-bit word.
.PP
UTF-EBCDIC is defined by
Unicode Technical Report #16 <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr16>
(often referred to as just \s-1TR16\s0).
It is defined based on \s-1CCSID 1047,\s0 not allowing for the differences for
other code pages.  This allows for easy interchange of text between
computers running different code pages, but makes it unusable, without
adaptation, for Perl on those other code pages.
.PP
The reason for this unusability is that a fundamental assumption of Perl
is that the characters it cares about for parsing and lexical analysis
are the same whether or not the text is in \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  For example, Perl
expects the character \f(CW"["\fR to have the same representation, no matter
if the string containing it (or program text) is \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded or not.
To ensure this, Perl adapts UTF-EBCDIC to the particular code page so
that all characters it expects to be \s-1UTF\-8\s0 invariant are in fact \s-1UTF\-8\s0
invariant.  This means that text generated on a computer running one
version of Perl's UTF-EBCDIC has to be translated to be intelligible to
a computer running another.
.PP
\&\s-1TR16\s0 implies a method to extend UTF-EBCDIC to encode points up through
\&\f(CW\*(C`2\ **\ 31\ \-\ 1\*(C'\fR.  Perl uses this method for code points up through
\&\f(CW\*(C`2\ **\ 30\ \-\ 1\*(C'\fR, but uses an incompatible method for larger ones, to
enable it to handle much larger code points than otherwise.
.SS "Using Encode"
.IX Subsection "Using Encode"
Starting from Perl 5.8 you can use the standard module Encode
to translate from \s-1EBCDIC\s0 to Latin\-1 code points.
Encode knows about more \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character sets than Perl can currently

For doing I/O it is suggested that you use the autotranslating features
of PerlIO, see perluniintro.
.PP
Since version 5.8 Perl uses the PerlIO I/O library.  This enables
you to use different encodings per \s-1IO\s0 channel.  For example you may use
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    use Encode;
\&    open($f, ">:encoding(ascii)", "test.ascii");
\&    print $f "Hello World!\en";
\&    open($f, ">:encoding(cp37)", "test.ebcdic");
\&    print $f "Hello World!\en";
\&    open($f, ">:encoding(latin1)", "test.latin1");
\&    print $f "Hello World!\en";
\&    open($f, ">:encoding(utf8)", "test.utf8");
\&    print $f "Hello World!\en";
.Ve
.PP
to get four files containing \*(L"Hello World!\en\*(R" in \s-1ASCII, CP 0037 EBCDIC,
ISO 8859\-1\s0 (Latin\-1) (in this example identical to \s-1ASCII\s0 since only \s-1ASCII\s0
characters were printed), and
UTF-EBCDIC (in this example identical to normal \s-1EBCDIC\s0 since only characters
that don't differ between \s-1EBCDIC\s0 and UTF-EBCDIC were printed).  See the
documentation of Encode::PerlIO for details.
.PP
As the PerlIO layer uses raw \s-1IO\s0 (bytes) internally, all this totally
ignores things like the type of your filesystem (\s-1ASCII\s0 or \s-1EBCDIC\s0).
.SH "SINGLE OCTET TABLES"
.IX Header "SINGLE OCTET TABLES"
The following tables list the \s-1ASCII\s0 and Latin 1 ordered sets including
the subsets: C0 controls (0..31), \s-1ASCII\s0 graphics (32..7e), delete (7f),
C1 controls (80..9f), and Latin\-1 (a.k.a. \s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0) (a0..ff).  In the
table names of the Latin 1
extensions to \s-1ASCII\s0 have been labelled with character names roughly
corresponding to \fIThe Unicode Standard, Version 6.1\fR albeit with
substitutions such as \f(CW\*(C`s/LATIN//\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`s/VULGAR//\*(C'\fR in all cases;
\&\f(CW\*(C`s/CAPITAL\ LETTER//\*(C'\fR in some cases; and
\&\f(CW\*(C`s/SMALL\ LETTER\ ([A\-Z])/\el$1/\*(C'\fR in some other
cases.  Controls are listed using their Unicode 6.2 abbreviations.
The differences between the 0037 and 1047 sets are
flagged with \f(CW\*(C`**\*(C'\fR.  The differences between the 1047 and POSIX-BC sets
are flagged with \f(CW\*(C`##.\*(C'\fR  All \f(CW\*(C`ord()\*(C'\fR numbers listed are decimal.  If you
would rather see this table listing octal values, then run the table
(that is, the pod source text of this document, since this recipe may not
work with a pod2_other_format translation) through:

.SS "Table in hex, sorted in 1047 order"
.IX Subsection "Table in hex, sorted in 1047 order"
Since this document was first written, the convention has become more
and more to use hexadecimal notation for code points.  To do this with
the recipes and to also sort is a multi-step process, so here, for
convenience, is the table from above, re-sorted to be in Code Page 1047
order, and using hex notation.

.SH "IDENTIFYING CHARACTER CODE SETS"
.IX Header "IDENTIFYING CHARACTER CODE SETS"
It is possible to determine which character set you are operating under.
But first you need to be really really sure you need to do this.  Your
code will be simpler and probably just as portable if you don't have
to test the character set and do different things, depending.  There are
actually only very few circumstances where it's not easy to write
straight-line code portable to all character sets.  See
\&\*(L"Unicode and \s-1EBCDIC\*(R"\s0 in perluniintro for how to portably specify
characters.
.PP
But there are some cases where you may want to know which character set
you are running under.  One possible example is doing
sorting in inner loops where performance is critical.
.PP
To determine if you are running under \s-1ASCII\s0 or \s-1EBCDIC,\s0 you can use the
return value of \f(CW\*(C`ord()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`chr()\*(C'\fR to test one or more character
values.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $is_ascii  = "A" eq chr(65);
\&    $is_ebcdic = "A" eq chr(193);
\&    $is_ascii  = ord("A") == 65;
\&    $is_ebcdic = ord("A") == 193;
.Ve
.PP
There's even less need to distinguish between \s-1EBCDIC\s0 code pages, but to
do so try looking at one or more of the characters that differ between
them.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $is_ascii           = ord(\*(Aq[\*(Aq) == 91;
\&    $is_ebcdic_37       = ord(\*(Aq[\*(Aq) == 186;
\&    $is_ebcdic_1047     = ord(\*(Aq[\*(Aq) == 173;
\&    $is_ebcdic_POSIX_BC = ord(\*(Aq[\*(Aq) == 187;
.Ve
.PP
However, it would be unwise to write tests such as:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $is_ascii = "\er" ne chr(13);  #  WRONG
\&    $is_ascii = "\en" ne chr(10);  #  ILL ADVISED
.Ve
.PP
Obviously the first of these will fail to distinguish most \s-1ASCII\s0
platforms from either a \s-1CCSID 0037,\s0 a 1047, or a POSIX-BC \s-1EBCDIC\s0
platform since \f(CW\*(C`"\er"\ eq\ chr(13)\*(C'\fR under all of those coded character
sets.  But note too that because \f(CW"\en"\fR is \f(CW\*(C`chr(13)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW"\er"\fR is
\&\f(CW\*(C`chr(10)\*(C'\fR on old Macintosh (which is an \s-1ASCII\s0 platform) the second
\&\f(CW$is_ascii\fR test will lead to trouble there.
.PP
To determine whether or not perl was built under an \s-1EBCDIC\s0
code page you can use the Config module like so:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Config;
\&    $is_ebcdic = $Config{\*(Aqebcdic\*(Aq} eq \*(Aqdefine\*(Aq;

.SS "tr///"
.IX Subsection "tr///"
In order to convert a string of characters from one character set to
another a simple list of numbers, such as in the right columns in the
above table, along with Perl's \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR operator is all that is needed.
The data in the table are in ASCII/Latin1 order, hence the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 columns
provide easy-to-use ASCII/Latin1 to \s-1EBCDIC\s0 operations that are also easily
reversed.
.PP
For example, to convert ASCII/Latin1 to code page 037 take the output of the
second numbers column from the output of recipe 2 (modified to add
\&\f(CW"\e"\fR characters), and use it in \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR like so:

\&    eval \*(Aq$ascii_string =~ tr/\*(Aq . $cp_037 . \*(Aq/\e000\-\e377/\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
Similarly one could take the output of the third numbers column from recipe 2
to obtain a \f(CW$cp_1047\fR table.  The fourth numbers column of the output from
recipe 2 could provide a \f(CW$cp_posix_bc\fR table suitable for transcoding as
well.
.PP
If you wanted to see the inverse tables, you would first have to sort on the
desired numbers column as in recipes 4, 5 or 6, then take the output of the
first numbers column.

On \s-1OS/390\s0 or z/OS see the \fBiconv\fR\|(1) manpage.  One way to invoke the \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR

.PP
.Vb 2

\&    $ascii_data = \`echo \*(Aq$ebcdic_data\*(Aq| iconv \-f IBM\-1047 \-t ISO8859\-1\`

.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # OS/390 or z/OS example
\&    $ebcdic_data = \`echo \*(Aq$ascii_data\*(Aq| iconv \-f ISO8859\-1 \-t IBM\-1047\`

.SH "OPERATOR DIFFERENCES"
.IX Header "OPERATOR DIFFERENCES"
The \f(CW\*(C`..\*(C'\fR range operator treats certain character ranges with
care on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.  For example the following array
will have twenty six elements on either an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform
or an \s-1ASCII\s0 platform:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @alphabet = (\*(AqA\*(Aq..\*(AqZ\*(Aq);   #  $#alphabet == 25
.Ve
.PP
The bitwise operators such as & ^ | may return different results
when operating on string or character data in a Perl program running
on an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform than when run on an \s-1ASCII\s0 platform.  Here is
an example adapted from the one in perlop:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    # EBCDIC\-based examples
\&    print "j p \en" ^ " a h";                      # prints "JAPH\en"
\&    print "JA" | "  ph\en";                        # prints "japh\en"
\&    print "JAPH\enJunk" & "\e277\e277\e277\e277\e277";  # prints "japh\en";
\&    print \*(Aqp N$\*(Aq ^ " E<H\en";                      # prints "Perl\en";
.Ve
.PP
An interesting property of the 32 C0 control characters
in the \s-1ASCII\s0 table is that they can \*(L"literally\*(R" be constructed
as control characters in Perl, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`(chr(0)\*(C'\fR eq \f(CW\*(C`\ec@\*(C'\fR)>
\&\f(CW\*(C`(chr(1)\*(C'\fR eq \f(CW\*(C`\ecA\*(C'\fR)>, and so on.  Perl on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms has been
ported to take \f(CW\*(C`\ec@\*(C'\fR to \f(CWchr(0)\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\ecA\*(C'\fR to \f(CWchr(1)\fR, etc. as well, but the
characters that result depend on which code page you are
using.  The table below uses the standard acronyms for the controls.
The POSIX-BC and 1047 sets are
identical throughout this range and differ from the 0037 set at only
one spot (21 decimal).  Note that the line terminator character
may be generated by \f(CW\*(C`\ecJ\*(C'\fR on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms but by \f(CW\*(C`\ecU\*(C'\fR on 1047 or POSIX-BC
platforms and cannot be generated as a \f(CW"\ec.letter."\fR control character on
0037 platforms.  Note also that \f(CW\*(C`\ec\e\*(C'\fR cannot be the final element in a string
or regex, as it will absorb the terminator.   But \f(CW\*(C`\ec\e\f(CIX\f(CW\*(C'\fR is a \f(CW\*(C`FILE
SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR concatenated with \fIX\fR for all \fIX\fR.
The outlier \f(CW\*(C`\ec?\*(C'\fR on \s-1ASCII,\s0 which yields a non\-C0 control \f(CW\*(C`DEL\*(C'\fR,
yields the outlier control \f(CW\*(C`APC\*(C'\fR on \s-1EBCDIC,\s0 the one that isn't in the
block of contiguous controls.  Note that a subtlety of this is that
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ec?\*(C'\fR on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms is an \s-1ASCII\s0 character, while it isn't
equivalent to any \s-1ASCII\s0 character in \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.

The \f(CW"c"\fR and \f(CW"C"\fR templates for \f(CW\*(C`pack()\*(C'\fR are dependent upon character set
encoding.  Examples of usage on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 include:
.Sp
.Vb 4

The \f(CW"U"\fR template has been ported to mean \*(L"Unicode\*(R" on all platforms so
that
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Sp
is true on all platforms.  If you want native code points for the low
256, use the \f(CW"W"\fR template.  This means that the equivalences
.Sp
.Vb 2

.Sp
will hold.

One must be careful with scalars and strings that are passed to
print that contain \s-1ASCII\s0 encodings.  One common place
for this to occur is in the output of the \s-1MIME\s0 type header for
\&\s-1CGI\s0 script writing.  For example, many Perl programming guides
recommend something similar to:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    print "Content\-type:\ettext/html\e015\e012\e015\e012";
\&    # this may be wrong on EBCDIC
.Ve
.Sp
You can instead write
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print "Content\-type:\ettext/html\er\en\er\en"; # OK for DGW et al
.Ve
.Sp
and have it work portably.
.Sp
That is because the translation from \s-1EBCDIC\s0 to \s-1ASCII\s0 is done
by the web server in this case.  Consult your web server's documentation for
further details.

The formats that can convert characters to numbers and vice versa
will be different from their \s-1ASCII\s0 counterparts when executed

.SH "REGULAR EXPRESSION DIFFERENCES"
.IX Header "REGULAR EXPRESSION DIFFERENCES"
You can write your regular expressions just like someone on an \s-1ASCII\s0
platform would do.  But keep in mind that using octal or hex notation to
specify a particular code point will give you the character that the
\&\s-1EBCDIC\s0 code page natively maps to it.   (This is also true of all
double-quoted strings.)  If you want to write portably, just use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{U+...}\*(C'\fR notation everywhere where you would have used \f(CW\*(C`\ex{...}\*(C'\fR,
and don't use octal notation at all.
.PP
Starting in Perl v5.22, this applies to ranges in bracketed character
classes.  If you say, for example, \f(CW\*(C`qr/[\eN{U+20}\-\eN{U+7F}]/\*(C'\fR, it means
the characters \f(CW\*(C`\eN{U+20}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eN{U+21}\*(C'\fR, ..., \f(CW\*(C`\eN{U+7F}\*(C'\fR.  This range
is all the printable characters that the \s-1ASCII\s0 character set contains.
.PP
Prior to v5.22, you couldn't specify any ranges portably, except
(starting in Perl v5.5.3) all subsets of the \f(CW\*(C`[A\-Z]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[a\-z]\*(C'\fR
ranges are specially coded to not pick up gap characters.  For example,
characters such as \*(L"o\*^\*(R" (\f(CW\*(C`o WITH CIRCUMFLEX\*(C'\fR) that lie between
\&\*(L"I\*(R" and \*(L"J\*(R" would not be matched by the regular expression range
\&\f(CW\*(C`/[H\-K]/\*(C'\fR.  But if either of the range end points is explicitly numeric
(and neither is specified by \f(CW\*(C`\eN{U+...}\*(C'\fR), the gap characters are
matched:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    /[\ex89\-\ex91]/
.Ve
.PP
will match \f(CW\*(C`\ex8e\*(C'\fR, even though \f(CW\*(C`\ex89\*(C'\fR is \*(L"i\*(R" and \f(CW\*(C`\ex91 \*(C'\fR is \*(L"j\*(R",
and \f(CW\*(C`\ex8e\*(C'\fR is a gap character, from the alphabetic viewpoint.
.PP
Another construct to be wary of is the inappropriate use of hex (unless
you use \f(CW\*(C`\eN{U+...}\*(C'\fR) or
octal constants in regular expressions.  Consider the following
set of subs:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub is_c0 {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\e000\-\e037]/;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_print_ascii {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\e040\-\e176]/;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_delete {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char eq "\e177";
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_c1 {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\e200\-\e237]/;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_latin_1 {    # But not ASCII; not C1
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\e240\-\e377]/;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
These are valid only on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms.  Starting in Perl v5.22, simply
changing the octal constants to equivalent \f(CW\*(C`\eN{U+...}\*(C'\fR values makes
them portable:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub is_c0 {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\eN{U+00}\-\eN{U+1F}]/;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_print_ascii {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\eN{U+20}\-\eN{U+7E}]/;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_delete {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char eq "\eN{U+7F}";
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_c1 {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\eN{U+80}\-\eN{U+9F}]/;

\&
\&    sub is_latin_1 {    # But not ASCII; not C1

\&        $char =~ /[\eN{U+A0}\-\eN{U+FF}]/;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
And here are some alternative portable ways to write them:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    sub Is_c0 {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        return $char =~ /[[:cntrl:]]/a && ! Is_delete($char);

\&    }
\&
\&    sub Is_print_ascii {

\&
\&        # Alternatively:

\&

\&               && $char !~ /[[:ascii:]]/
\&               && $char !~ /[[:cntrl:]]/;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Another way to write \f(CW\*(C`Is_latin_1()\*(C'\fR would be
to use the characters in the range explicitly:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    sub Is_latin_1 {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\ XXXXXXXXXXXX\%XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXA\*`A\*'A\*^A\*~A\*:A\*o\*(AeC\*,E\*`E\*'E\*^E\*:I\*`I\*'I\*^I\*:]
\&                  [\*(D-N\*~O\*`O\*'O\*^O\*~O\*:XO\*/U\*`U\*'U\*^U\*:Y\*'\*(Th\*8a\*`a\*'a\*^a\*~a\*:a\*o\*(aec\*,e\*`e\*'e\*^e\*:i\*`i\*'i\*^i\*:\*(d-n\*~o\*`o\*'o\*^o\*~o\*:Xo\*/u\*`u\*'u\*^u\*:y\*'\*(thy\*:]/x;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Although that form may run into trouble in network transit (due to the
presence of 8 bit characters) or on non ISO-Latin character sets.  But
it does allow \f(CW\*(C`Is_c1\*(C'\fR to be rewritten so it works on Perls that don't
have \f(CW\*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq\fR (earlier than v5.14):
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    sub Is_latin_1 {    # But not ASCII; not C1
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        return ord($char) < 256

.SH "SORTING"
.IX Header "SORTING"
One big difference between ASCII-based character sets and \s-1EBCDIC\s0 ones
are the relative positions of the characters when sorted in native
order.  Of most concern are the upper\- and lowercase letters, the
digits, and the underscore (\f(CW"_"\fR).  On \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms the native sort
order has the digits come before the uppercase letters which come before
the underscore which comes before the lowercase letters.  On \s-1EBCDIC,\s0 the
underscore comes first, then the lowercase letters, then the uppercase
ones, and the digits last.  If sorted on an ASCII-based platform, the
two-letter abbreviation for a physician comes before the two letter
abbreviation for drive; that is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& @sorted = sort(qw(Dr. dr.));  # @sorted holds (\*(AqDr.\*(Aq,\*(Aqdr.\*(Aq) on ASCII,
\&                                  # but (\*(Aqdr.\*(Aq,\*(AqDr.\*(Aq) on EBCDIC
.Ve
.PP
The property of lowercase before uppercase letters in \s-1EBCDIC\s0 is
even carried to the Latin 1 \s-1EBCDIC\s0 pages such as 0037 and 1047.
An example would be that \*(L"E\*:\*(R" (\f(CW\*(C`E WITH DIAERESIS\*(C'\fR, 203) comes
before \*(L"e\*:\*(R" (\f(CW\*(C`e WITH DIAERESIS\*(C'\fR, 235) on an \s-1ASCII\s0 platform, but
the latter (83) comes before the former (115) on an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform.
(Astute readers will note that the uppercase version of \*(L"\*8\*(R"
\&\f(CW\*(C`SMALL LETTER SHARP S\*(C'\fR is simply \*(L"\s-1SS\*(R"\s0 and that the upper case versions
of \*(L"y\*:\*(R" (small \f(CW\*(C`y WITH DIAERESIS\*(C'\fR) and \*(L"X\*(R" (\f(CW\*(C`MICRO SIGN\*(C'\fR)
are not in the 0..255 range but are in Unicode, in a Unicode enabled
Perl).
.PP
The sort order will cause differences between results obtained on
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 platforms versus \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.  What follows are some suggestions
on how to deal with these differences.

If performance is an issue, and you don't care if the output is in the

non\-Latin1, then apply \f(CW\*(C`tr/[a\-z]/[A\-Z]/\*(C'\fR, and then \f(CW\*(C`sort()\*(C'\fR.  If the
data are primarily lowercase non Latin1 then apply \f(CW\*(C`tr/[A\-Z]/[a\-z]/\*(C'\fR
before sorting.  If the data are primarily \s-1UPPERCASE\s0 and include Latin\-1
characters then apply:
.PP

then \f(CW\*(C`sort()\*(C'\fR.  If you have a choice, it's better to lowercase things

.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # This QP encoder works on ASCII only
\&    $qp_string =~ s/([=\ex00\-\ex1F\ex80\-\exFF])/
\&                    sprintf("=%02X",ord($1))/xge;
.Ve
.PP
Starting in Perl v5.22, this is trivially changeable to work portably on
both \s-1ASCII\s0 and \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # This QP encoder works on both ASCII and EBCDIC
\&    $qp_string =~ s/([=\eN{U+00}\-\eN{U+1F}\eN{U+80}\-\eN{U+FF}])/
\&                    sprintf("=%02X",ord($1))/xge;
.Ve
.PP
For earlier Perls, a \s-1QP\s0 encoder that works on both \s-1ASCII\s0 and \s-1EBCDIC\s0
platforms would look somewhat like the following:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $delete = utf8::unicode_to_native(ord("\ex7F"));
\&    $qp_string =~
\&      s/([^[:print:]$delete])/
\&         sprintf("=%02X",utf8::native_to_unicode(ord($1)))/xage;
.Ve
.PP
(although in production code the substitutions might be done
in the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 branch with the function call and separately in the
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 branch without the expense of the identity map; in Perl v5.22, the
identity map is optimized out so there is no expense, but the
alternative above is simpler and is also available in v5.22).
.PP
Such \s-1QP\s0 strings can be decoded with:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # This QP decoder is limited to ASCII only
\&    $string =~ s/=([[:xdigit:][[:xdigit:])/chr hex $1/ge;
\&    $string =~ s/=[\en\er]+$//;
.Ve
.PP
Whereas a \s-1QP\s0 decoder that works on both \s-1ASCII\s0 and \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms
would look somewhat like the following:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $string =~ s/=([[:xdigit:][:xdigit:]])/
\&                                chr utf8::native_to_unicode(hex $1)/xge;
\&    $string =~ s/=[\en\er]+$//;

.SS "Caesarean ciphers"
.IX Subsection "Caesarean ciphers"
The practice of shifting an alphabet one or more characters for encipherment
dates back thousands of years and was explicitly detailed by Gaius Julius
Caesar in his \fBGallic Wars\fR text.  A single alphabet shift is sometimes
referred to as a rotation and the shift amount is given as a number \f(CW$n\fR after
the string 'rot' or \*(L"rot$n\*(R".  Rot0 and rot26 would designate identity maps
on the 26\-letter English version of the Latin alphabet.  Rot13 has the
interesting property that alternate subsequent invocations are identity maps
(thus rot13 is its own non-trivial inverse in the group of 26 alphabet
rotations).  Hence the following is a rot13 encoder and decoder that will
work on \s-1ASCII\s0 and \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/perl
\&
\&    while(<>){
\&        tr/n\-za\-mN\-ZA\-M/a\-zA\-Z/;
\&        print;
\&    }
.Ve

.SH "Hashing order and checksums"
.IX Header "Hashing order and checksums"
Perl deliberately randomizes hash order for security purposes on both
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 and \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.
.PP
\&\s-1EBCDIC\s0 checksums will differ for the same file translated into \s-1ASCII\s0
and vice versa.
.SH "I18N AND L10N"
.IX Header "I18N AND L10N"
Internationalization (I18N) and localization (L10N) are supported at least
in principle even on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.  The details are system-dependent
and discussed under the \*(L"\s-1OS ISSUES\*(R"\s0 section below.
.SH "MULTI-OCTET CHARACTER SETS"

Perl works with UTF-EBCDIC, a multi-byte encoding.  In Perls earlier

Not all shells will allow multiple \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR string arguments to perl to
be concatenated together properly as recipes in this document
0, 2, 4, 5, and 6 might
seem to imply.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There are a significant number of test failures in the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
shipped with Perl v5.22 and 5.24.  These are only in modules not primarily
maintained by Perl 5 porters.  Some of these are failures in the tests
only: they don't realize that it is proper to get different results on
\&\s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.  And some of the failures are real bugs.  If you
compile and do a \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR on Perl, all tests on the \f(CW\*(C`/cpan\*(C'\fR
directory are skipped.
.Sp
Encode partially works.
.IP "\(bu" 4
In earlier Perl versions, when byte and character data were
concatenated, the new string was sometimes created by
decoding the byte strings as \fI\s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0 (Latin\-1)\fR, even if the
old Unicode string used \s-1EBCDIC.\s0

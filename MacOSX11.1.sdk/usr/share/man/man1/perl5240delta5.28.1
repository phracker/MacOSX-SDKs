.SS "Postfix dereferencing is no longer experimental"
.IX Subsection "Postfix dereferencing is no longer experimental"
Using the \f(CW\*(C`postderef\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`postderef_qq\*(C'\fR features no longer emits a
warning. Existing code that disables the \f(CW\*(C`experimental::postderef\*(C'\fR warning
category that they previously used will continue to work. The \f(CW\*(C`postderef\*(C'\fR
feature has no effect; all Perl code can use postfix dereferencing,
regardless of what feature declarations are in scope. The \f(CW5.24\fR feature
bundle now includes the \f(CW\*(C`postderef_qq\*(C'\fR feature.

.SS "perl will now croak when closing an in-place output file fails"
.IX Subsection "perl will now croak when closing an in-place output file fails"
Until now, failure to close the output file for an in-place edit was not
detected, meaning that the input file could be clobbered without the edit being
successfully completed.  Now, when the output file cannot be closed
successfully, an exception is raised.
.ie n .SS "New ""\eb{lb}"" boundary in regular expressions"
.el .SS "New \f(CW\eb{lb}\fP boundary in regular expressions"
.IX Subsection "New b{lb} boundary in regular expressions"
\&\f(CW\*(C`lb\*(C'\fR stands for Line Break.  It is a Unicode property
that determines where a line of text is suitable to break (typically so
that it can be output without overflowing the available horizontal
space).  This capability has long been furnished by the
Unicode::LineBreak module, but now a light-weight, non-customizable
version that is suitable for many purposes is in core Perl.
.ie n .SS """qr/(?[ ])/"" now works in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales"
.el .SS "\f(CWqr/(?[ ])/\fP now works in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales"
.IX Subsection "qr/(?[ ])/ now works in UTF-8 locales"
Extended Bracketed Character Classes
now will successfully compile when \f(CW\*(C`use\ locale\*(C'\fR is in effect.  The compiled
pattern will use standard Unicode rules.  If the runtime locale is not a
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 one, a warning is raised and standard Unicode rules are used
anyway.  No tainting is done since the outcome does not actually depend
on the locale.
.ie n .SS "Integer shift (""<<"" and "">>"") now more explicitly defined"
.el .SS "Integer shift (\f(CW<<\fP and \f(CW>>\fP) now more explicitly defined"
.IX Subsection "Integer shift (<< and >>) now more explicitly defined"
Negative shifts are reverse shifts: left shift becomes right shift,
and right shift becomes left shift.
.PP
Shifting by the number of bits in a native integer (or more) is zero,
except when the \*(L"overshift\*(R" is right shifting a negative value under
\&\f(CW\*(C`use integer\*(C'\fR, in which case the result is \-1 (arithmetic shift).
.PP
Until now negative shifting and overshifting have been undefined
because they have relied on whatever the C implementation happens
to do.  For example, for the overshift a common C behavior is
\&\*(L"modulo shift\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  1 >> 64 == 1 >> (64 % 64) == 1 >> 0 == 1  # Common C behavior.
\&
\&  # And the same for <<, while Perl now produces 0 for both.
.Ve
.PP
Now these behaviors are well-defined under Perl, regardless of what
the underlying C implementation does.  Note, however, that you are still
constrained by the native integer width: you need to know how far left you
can go.  You can use for example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use Config;
\&  my $wordbits = $Config{uvsize} * 8;  # Or $Config{uvsize} << 3.
.Ve
.PP
If you need a more bits on the left shift, you can use for example
the \f(CW\*(C`bigint\*(C'\fR pragma, or the \f(CW\*(C`Bit::Vector\*(C'\fR module from \s-1CPAN.\s0
.SS "printf and sprintf now allow reordered precision arguments"
.IX Subsection "printf and sprintf now allow reordered precision arguments"
That is, \f(CW\*(C`sprintf \*(Aq|%.*2$d|\*(Aq, 2, 3\*(C'\fR now returns \f(CW\*(C`|002|\*(C'\fR. This extends
the existing reordering mechanism (which allows reordering for arguments
that are used as format fields, widths, and vector separators).
.ie n .SS "More fields provided to ""sigaction"" callback with ""SA_SIGINFO"""
.el .SS "More fields provided to \f(CWsigaction\fP callback with \f(CWSA_SIGINFO\fP"
.IX Subsection "More fields provided to sigaction callback with SA_SIGINFO"
When passing the \f(CW\*(C`SA_SIGINFO\*(C'\fR flag to sigaction, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`status\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`uid\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pid\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`addr\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`band\*(C'\fR fields are now
included in the hash passed to the handler, if supported by the
platform.
.SS "Hashbang redirection to Perl 6"
.IX Subsection "Hashbang redirection to Perl 6"
Previously perl would redirect to another interpreter if it found a
hashbang path unless the path contains \*(L"perl\*(R" (see perlrun). To improve
compatibility with Perl 6 this behavior has been extended to also redirect
if \*(L"perl\*(R" is followed by \*(L"6\*(R".
.SH "Security"
.IX Header "Security"
.ie n .SS "Set proper umask before calling mkstemp(3)"
.el .SS "Set proper umask before calling \f(CWmkstemp(3)\fP"
.IX Subsection "Set proper umask before calling mkstemp(3)"
In 5.22 perl started setting umask to 0600 before calling \f(CWmkstemp(3)\fR
and restoring it afterwards. This wrongfully tells \f(CWopen(2)\fR to strip
the owner read and write bits from the given mode before applying it,
rather than the intended negation of leaving only those bits in place.
.PP
Systems that use mode 0666 in \f(CWmkstemp(3)\fR (like old versions of
glibc) create a file with permissions 0066, leaving world read and
write permissions regardless of current umask.
.PP
This has been fixed by using umask 0177 instead. [perl #127322]

.ie n .SS "Remove duplicate environment variables from ""environ"""
.el .SS "Remove duplicate environment variables from \f(CWenviron\fP"
.IX Subsection "Remove duplicate environment variables from environ"
Previously, if an environment variable appeared more than once in
\&\f(CW\*(C`environ[]\*(C'\fR, \f(CW%ENV\fR would contain the last entry for that name,
while a typical \f(CW\*(C`getenv()\*(C'\fR would return the first entry. We now
make sure \f(CW%ENV\fR contains the same as what \f(CW\*(C`getenv\*(C'\fR returns.
.PP
Second, we remove duplicates from \f(CW\*(C`environ[]\*(C'\fR, so if a setting
with that name is set in \f(CW%ENV\fR, we won't pass an unsafe value
to a child process.

.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.ie n .SS "The ""autoderef"" feature has been removed"
.el .SS "The \f(CWautoderef\fP feature has been removed"
.IX Subsection "The autoderef feature has been removed"
The experimental \f(CW\*(C`autoderef\*(C'\fR feature (which allowed calling \f(CW\*(C`push\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`pop\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`shift\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`unshift\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`splice\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR on
a scalar argument) has been deemed unsuccessful. It has now been removed;
trying to use the feature (or to disable the \f(CW\*(C`experimental::autoderef\*(C'\fR
warning it previously triggered) now yields an exception.
.ie n .SS "Lexical $_ has been removed"
.el .SS "Lexical \f(CW$_\fP has been removed"
.IX Subsection "Lexical $_ has been removed"
\&\f(CW\*(C`my $_\*(C'\fR was introduced in Perl 5.10, and subsequently caused much confusion
with no obvious solution.  In Perl 5.18.0, it was made experimental on the
theory that it would either be removed or redesigned in a less confusing (but
backward-incompatible) way.  Over the following years, no alternatives were
proposed.  The feature has now been removed and will fail to compile.
.ie n .SS """qr/\eb{wb}/"" is now tailored to Perl expectations"
.el .SS "\f(CWqr/\eb{wb}/\fP is now tailored to Perl expectations"
.IX Subsection "qr/b{wb}/ is now tailored to Perl expectations"
This is now more suited to be a drop-in replacement for plain \f(CW\*(C`\eb\*(C'\fR, but
giving better results for parsing natural language.  Previously it
strictly followed the current Unicode rules which calls for it to match
between each white space character.  Now it doesn't generally match
within spans of white space, behaving like \f(CW\*(C`\eb\*(C'\fR does.  See
\&\*(L"\eb{wb}\*(R" in perlrebackslash
.SS "Regular expression compilation errors"
.IX Subsection "Regular expression compilation errors"
Some regular expression patterns that had runtime errors now
don't compile at all.
.PP
Almost all Unicode properties using the \f(CW\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eP{}\*(C'\fR regular
expression pattern constructs are now checked for validity at pattern
compilation time, and invalid ones will cause the program to not
compile.  In earlier releases, this check was often deferred until run
time.  Whenever an error check is moved from run\- to compile time,
erroneous code is caught 100% of the time, whereas before it would only
get caught if and when the offending portion actually gets executed,
which for unreachable code might be never.
.ie n .SS """qr/\eN{}/"" now disallowed under ""use re ""strict"""""
.el .SS "\f(CWqr/\eN{}/\fP now disallowed under \f(CWuse re ``strict''\fP"
.IX Subsection "qr/N{}/ now disallowed under use re ""strict"""
An empty \f(CW\*(C`\eN{}\*(C'\fR makes no sense, but for backwards compatibility is
accepted as doing nothing, though a deprecation warning is raised by
default.  But now this is a fatal error under the experimental feature
\&\*(L"'strict' mode\*(R" in re.
.SS "Nested declarations are now disallowed"
.IX Subsection "Nested declarations are now disallowed"
A \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR declaration is no longer allowed inside
of another \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR declaration.
.PP
For example, these are now fatal:

.IX Subsection "The /C/ character class has been removed."
This regular expression character class was deprecated in v5.20.0 and has
produced a deprecation warning since v5.22.0. It is now a compile-time
error. If you need to examine the individual bytes that make up a
UTF8\-encoded character, then use \f(CW\*(C`utf8::encode()\*(C'\fR on the string (or a
copy) first.
.ie n .SS """chdir(\*(Aq\*(Aq)"" no longer chdirs home"

.IX Subsection "chdir() no longer chdirs home"
Using \f(CW\*(C`chdir(\*(Aq\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`chdir(undef)\*(C'\fR to chdir home has been deprecated since
perl v5.8, and will now fail.  Use \f(CW\*(C`chdir()\*(C'\fR instead.
.SS "\s-1ASCII\s0 characters in variable names must now be all visible"
.IX Subsection "ASCII characters in variable names must now be all visible"
It was legal until now on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms for variable names to contain
non-graphical \s-1ASCII\s0 control characters (ordinals 0 through 31, and 127,
which are the C0 controls and \f(CW\*(C`DELETE\*(C'\fR).  This usage has been
deprecated since v5.20, and as of now causes a syntax error.  The
variables these names referred to are special, reserved by Perl for
whatever use it may choose, now, or in the future.  Each such variable
has an alternative way of spelling it.  Instead of the single
non-graphic control character, a two character sequence beginning with a
caret is used, like \f(CW$^]\fR and \f(CW\*(C`${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\*(C'\fR.  Details are at
perlvar.   It remains legal, though unwise and deprecated (raising a
deprecation warning), to use certain non-graphic non-ASCII characters in
variables names when not under \f(CW\*(C`use\ utf8\*(C'\fR.  No code should do this,
as all such variables are reserved by Perl, and Perl doesn't currently
define any of them (but could at any time, without notice).
.ie n .SS "An off by one issue in $Carp::MaxArgNums has been fixed"
.el .SS "An off by one issue in \f(CW$Carp::MaxArgNums\fP has been fixed"
.IX Subsection "An off by one issue in $Carp::MaxArgNums has been fixed"
\&\f(CW$Carp::MaxArgNums\fR is supposed to be the number of arguments to display.
Prior to this version, it was instead showing \f(CW$Carp::MaxArgNums\fR + 1 arguments,
contrary to the documentation.
.ie n .SS "Only blanks and tabs are now allowed within ""[...]"" within ""(?[...])""."
.el .SS "Only blanks and tabs are now allowed within \f(CW[...]\fP within \f(CW(?[...])\fP."
.IX Subsection "Only blanks and tabs are now allowed within [...] within (?[...])."
The experimental Extended Bracketed Character Classes can contain regular
bracketed character classes within them.  These differ from regular ones in
that white space is generally ignored, unless escaped by preceding it with a
backslash.  The white space that is ignored is now limited to just tab \f(CW\*(C`\et\*(C'\fR
and \s-1SPACE\s0 characters.  Previously, it was any white space.  See
\&\*(L"Extended Bracketed Character Classes\*(R" in perlrecharclass.
.SH "Deprecations"
.IX Header "Deprecations"
.ie n .SS "Using code points above the platform's ""IV_MAX"" is now deprecated"
.el .SS "Using code points above the platform's \f(CWIV_MAX\fP is now deprecated"
.IX Subsection "Using code points above the platform's IV_MAX is now deprecated"
Unicode defines code points in the range \f(CW\*(C`0..0x10FFFF\*(C'\fR.  Some standards
at one time defined them up to 2**31 \- 1, but Perl has allowed them to
be as high as anything that will fit in a word on the platform being
used.  However, use of those above the platform's \f(CW\*(C`IV_MAX\*(C'\fR is broken in
some constructs, notably \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR, regular expression patterns involving
quantifiers, and in some arithmetic and comparison operations, such as
being the upper limit of a loop.  Now the use of such code points raises
a deprecation warning, unless that warning category is turned off.
\&\f(CW\*(C`IV_MAX\*(C'\fR is typically 2**31 \-1 on 32\-bit platforms, and 2**63\-1 on
64\-bit ones.
.SS "Doing bitwise operations on strings containing code points above 0xFF is deprecated"
.IX Subsection "Doing bitwise operations on strings containing code points above 0xFF is deprecated"
The string bitwise operators treat their operands as strings of bytes,
and values beyond 0xFF are nonsensical in this context.  To operate on
encoded bytes, first encode the strings.  To operate on code points'
numeric values, use \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`map ord\*(C'\fR.  In the future, this
warning will be replaced by an exception.
.ie n .SS """sysread()"", ""syswrite()"", ""recv()"" and ""send()"" are deprecated on :utf8 handles"
.el .SS "\f(CWsysread()\fP, \f(CWsyswrite()\fP, \f(CWrecv()\fP and \f(CWsend()\fP are deprecated on :utf8 handles"
.IX Subsection "sysread(), syswrite(), recv() and send() are deprecated on :utf8 handles"
The \f(CW\*(C`sysread()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`recv()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`syswrite()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`send()\*(C'\fR operators
are deprecated on handles that have the \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR layer, either
explicitly, or implicitly, eg., with the \f(CW\*(C`:encoding(UTF\-16LE)\*(C'\fR layer.
.PP
Both \f(CW\*(C`sysread()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`recv()\*(C'\fR currently use only the \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR flag for the
stream, ignoring the actual layers.  Since \f(CW\*(C`sysread()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`recv()\*(C'\fR do no
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 validation they can end up creating invalidly encoded scalars.
.PP
Similarly, \f(CW\*(C`syswrite()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`send()\*(C'\fR use only the \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR flag, otherwise
ignoring any layers.  If the flag is set, both write the value \s-1UTF\-8\s0
encoded, even if the layer is some different encoding, such as the
example above.
.PP
Ideally, all of these operators would completely ignore the \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR
state, working only with bytes, but this would result in silently
breaking existing code.  To avoid this a future version of perl will
throw an exception when any of \f(CW\*(C`sysread()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`recv()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`syswrite()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`send()\*(C'\fR
are called on handle with the \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR layer.

most common ones, and skips much of the work when
a program tries to change case in them (like \f(CW\*(C`ucfirst()\*(C'\fR) or match
caselessly (\f(CW\*(C`qr//i\*(C'\fR).  This will speed up a program, such as a web
server, that can operate on multiple languages, while it is operating on a
caseless one.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`/fixed\-substr/\*(C'\fR has been made much faster.
.Sp
On platforms with a libc \f(CW\*(C`memchr()\*(C'\fR implementation which makes good use of
underlying hardware support, patterns which include fixed substrings will now
often be much faster; for example with glibc on a recent x86_64 \s-1CPU,\s0 this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $s = "a" x 1000 . "wxyz";
\&    $s =~ /wxyz/ for 1..30000
.Ve
.Sp
is now about 7 times faster.  On systems with slow \f(CW\*(C`memchr()\*(C'\fR, e.g. 32\-bit \s-1ARM\s0
Raspberry Pi, there will be a small or little speedup.  Conversely, some
pathological cases, such as \f(CW\*(C`"ab" x 1000 =~ /aa/\*(C'\fR will be slower now; up to 3
times slower on the rPi, 1.5x slower on x86_64.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Faster addition, subtraction and multiplication.
.Sp
Since 5.8.0, arithmetic became slower due to the need to support
64\-bit integers. To deal with 64\-bit integers, a lot more corner
cases need to be checked, which adds time. We now detect common
cases where there is no need to check for those corner cases,
and special-case them.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Preincrement, predecrement, postincrement, and postdecrement have been
made faster by internally splitting the functions which handled multiple
cases into different functions.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Creating Perl debugger data structures (see \*(L"Debugger Internals\*(R" in perldebguts)
for XSUBs and const subs has been removed.  This removed one glob/scalar combo
for each unique \f(CW\*(C`.c\*(C'\fR file that XSUBs and const subs came from.  On startup
(\f(CW\*(C`perl \-e"0"\*(C'\fR) about half a dozen glob/scalar debugger combos were created.
Loading \s-1XS\s0 modules created more glob/scalar combos.  These things were
being created regardless of whether the perl debugger was being used,
and despite the fact that it can't debug C code anyway
.IP "\(bu" 4
On Win32, \f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fRing or \f(CW\*(C`\-X\*(C'\fRing a path, if the file or directory does not

extended so that it can represent code points up to 2 ** 64 \- 1 on
platforms with 64\-bit words.  This brings it into parity with \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
This enhancement requires an incompatible change to the representation
of code points in the range 2 ** 30 to 2 ** 31 \-1 (the latter was the
previous maximum representable code point).  This means that a file that
contains one of these code points, written out with previous versions of
perl cannot be read in, without conversion, by a perl containing this
change.  We do not believe any such files are in existence, but if you
do have one, submit a ticket at perlbug@perl.org <mailto:perlbug@perl.org>,
and we will write a conversion script for you.

Until now \s-1OS X\s0 builds of perl have specified a link target of 10.3 (Panther,

regardless of changes in \s-1OS X, SDK,\s0 or compiler and linker versions.  To

The new behavior provides a much more robust solution for checking Winsock
errors in portable software without accidentally matching \s-1POSIX\s0 tests that were
intended for other OSes and may have different meanings for Winsock.

The old behavior is currently retained, warts and all, for backwards
compatibility, but users are encouraged to change any code that tests \f(CW$!\fR
against \f(CW\*(C`E*\*(C'\fR constants for Winsock errors to instead test \f(CW$^E\fR against

could produce an assertion or a segmentation fault.  This now reliably
complains about the unterminated here-doc.  [perl #125540]

\&\f(CW\*(C`untie()\*(C'\fR would sometimes return the last value returned by the \f(CW\*(C`UNTIE()\*(C'\fR

Fixed an operator precedence problem when \f(CW\*(C` castflags & 2\*(C'\fR is true.

Caching of \s-1DESTROY\s0 methods could result in a non-pointer or a
non-STASH stored in the \f(CW\*(C`SvSTASH()\*(C'\fR slot of a stash, breaking the B
\&\f(CW\*(C`STASH()\*(C'\fR method.  The \s-1DESTROY\s0 method is now cached in the \s-1MRO\s0 metadata
for the stash.  [perl #126410]

The \s-1AUTOLOAD\s0 method is now called when searching for a \s-1DESTROY\s0 method,

Avoid parsing beyond the end of the buffer when processing a \f(CW\*(C`#line\*(C'\fR
directive with no filename.  [perl #127334]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl now raises a warning when a regular expression pattern looks like
it was supposed to contain a \s-1POSIX\s0 class, like \f(CW\*(C`qr/[[:alpha:]]/\*(C'\fR, but
there was some slight defect in its specification which causes it to
instead be treated as a regular bracketed character class.  An example
would be missing the second colon in the above like this:
\&\f(CW\*(C`qr/[[:alpha]]/\*(C'\fR.  This compiles to match a sequence of two characters.
The second is \f(CW"]"\fR, and the first is any of: \f(CW"["\fR, \f(CW":"\fR, \f(CW"a"\fR,
\&\f(CW"h"\fR, \f(CW"l"\fR, or \f(CW"p"\fR.   This is unlikely to be the intended
meaning, and now a warning is raised.  No warning is raised unless the
specification is very close to one of the 14 legal \s-1POSIX\s0 classes.  (See
\&\*(L"\s-1POSIX\s0 Character Classes\*(R" in perlrecharclass.)
[perl #8904]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Certain regex patterns involving a complemented \s-1POSIX\s0 class in an
inverted bracketed character class, and matching something else
optionally would improperly fail to match.  An example of one that could
fail is \f(CW\*(C`qr/_?[^\eWbar]\ex{100}/\*(C'\fR.  This has been fixed.

Perl 5.22 added support to the C99 hexadecimal floating point notation,

\&\f(CW\*(C`/...\eG/\*(C'\fR no longer crashes on utf8 strings. When \f(CW\*(C`\eG\*(C'\fR is a fixed number
of characters from the start of the regex, perl needs to count back that
many characters from the current \f(CW\*(C`pos()\*(C'\fR position and start matching from
there. However, it was counting back bytes rather than characters, which
could lead to panics on utf8 strings.

In some cases operators that return integers would return negative

The \f(CW\*(C`pipe()\*(C'\fR operator would assert for \s-1DEBUGGING\s0 builds instead of

In some cases, failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed

A regression from Perl v5.20 was fixed in which debugging output of regular
expression compilation was wrong.  (The pattern was correctly compiled, but
what got displayed for it was wrong.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eb{sb}\*(C'\fR works much better.  In Perl v5.22.0, this new construct didn't
seem to give the expected results, yet passed all the tests in the
extensive suite furnished by Unicode.  It turns out that it was because
these were short input strings, and the failures had to do with longer
inputs.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Certain syntax errors in
\&\*(L"Extended Bracketed Character Classes\*(R" in perlrecharclass caused panics
instead of the proper error message.  This has now been fixed. [perl
#126481]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl 5.20 added a message when a quantifier in a regular
expression was useless, but then caused the parser to skip it;
this caused the surplus quantifier to be silently ignored, instead
of throwing an error. This is now fixed. [perl #126253]
.IP "\(bu" 4
The switch to building non-XS modules last in win32/makefile.mk (introduced
by design as part of the changes to enable parallel building) caused the
build of \s-1POSIX\s0 to break due to problems with the version module. This

Fixed an issue with \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR where \f(CW\*(C`pack "H"\*(C'\fR (and \f(CW\*(C`pack "h"\*(C'\fR)

There were places in regular expression patterns where comments (\f(CW\*(C`(?#...)\*(C'\fR)

Some regressions from Perl 5.20 have been fixed, in which some syntax errors in

.IP "\(bu" 4
Some problems with attempting to extend the perl stack to around 2G or 4G
entries have been fixed.  This was particularly an issue on 32\-bit perls built
to use 64\-bit integers, and was easily noticeable with the list repetition
operator, e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @a = (1) x $big_number
.Ve

Formerly perl may have crashed, depending on the exact value of \f(CW$big_number\fR;
now it will typically raise an exception.

.IP "\(bu" 4
In a regex conditional expression \f(CW\*(C`(?(condition)yes\-pattern|no\-pattern)\*(C'\fR, if
the condition is \f(CW\*(C`(?!)\*(C'\fR then perl failed the match outright instead of

.IP "\(bu" 4
The special backtracking control verbs \f(CW\*(C`(*VERB:ARG)\*(C'\fR now all allow an optional

Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack.  This

In perl v5.22.0, the logic changed when parsing a numeric parameter to the \-C

Zero \-DPERL_TRACE_OPS memory for sub-threads.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl_clone_using()\*(C'\fR was missing Zero init of PL_op_exec_cnt[].  This
caused sub-threads in threaded \-DPERL_TRACE_OPS builds to spew exceedingly
large op-counts at destruct.  These counts would print \f(CW%x\fR as \*(L"\s-1ABABABAB\*(R",\s0
clearly a mem-poison value.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A leak in the \s-1XS\s0 typemap caused one scalar to be leaked each time a \f(CW\*(C`FILE *\*(C'\fR
or a \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO *\*(C'\fR was \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT:\*(C'\fRed or imported to Perl, since perl 5.000. These
particular typemap entries are thought to be extremely rarely used by \s-1XS\s0

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`alarm()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`sleep()\*(C'\fR will now warn if the argument is a negative number

Perl can again be compiled with any Unicode version.  This used to
(mostly) work, but was lost in v5.18 through v5.20.  The property

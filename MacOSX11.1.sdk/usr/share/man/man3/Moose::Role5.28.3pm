.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The concept of roles is documented in Moose::Manual::Roles. This document
serves as \s-1API\s0 documentation.
.SH "EXPORTED FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "EXPORTED FUNCTIONS"
Moose::Role currently supports all of the functions that Moose exports, but
differs slightly in how some items are handled (see \*(L"\s-1CAVEATS\*(R"\s0 below for
details).
.PP
Moose::Role also offers two role-specific keyword exports:
.SS "requires (@method_names)"
.IX Subsection "requires (@method_names)"
Roles can require that certain methods are implemented by any class which
\&\f(CW\*(C`does\*(C'\fR the role.
.PP
Note that attribute accessors also count as methods for the purposes
of satisfying the requirements of a role.
.SS "excludes (@role_names)"
.IX Subsection "excludes (@role_names)"
Roles can \f(CW\*(C`exclude\*(C'\fR other roles, in effect saying "I can never be combined
with these \f(CW@role_names\fR". This is a feature which should not be used
lightly.
.SS "no Moose::Role"
.IX Subsection "no Moose::Role"
Moose::Role offers a way to remove the keywords it exports, through the
\&\f(CW\*(C`unimport\*(C'\fR method. You simply have to say \f(CW\*(C`no Moose::Role\*(C'\fR at the bottom of
your code for this to work.
.SH "METACLASS"
.IX Header "METACLASS"
When you use Moose::Role, you can specify traits which will be applied to your
role metaclass:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Moose::Role \-traits => \*(AqMy::Trait\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
This is very similar to the attribute traits feature. When you do
this, your class's \f(CW\*(C`meta\*(C'\fR object will have the specified traits
applied to it. See \*(L"Metaclass and Trait Name Resolution\*(R" in Moose for more
details.
.PP
All role metaclasses (note, not the role itself) extend Moose::Meta::Role.
You can test if a package is a role or not using \*(L"is_role\*(R" in Moose::Util.
.SH "APPLYING ROLES"
.IX Header "APPLYING ROLES"
In addition to being applied to a class using the 'with' syntax (see
Moose::Manual::Roles) and using the Moose::Util 'apply_all_roles'
method, roles may also be applied to an instance of a class using
Moose::Util 'apply_all_roles' or the role's metaclass:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   MyApp::Test::SomeRole\->meta\->apply( $instance );
.Ve
.PP
Doing this creates a new, mutable, anonymous subclass, applies the role to that,
and reblesses. In a debugger, for example, you will see class names of the
form \f(CW\*(C` Moose::Meta::Class::_\|_ANON_\|_::SERIAL::6 \*(C'\fR, which means that doing a
\&'ref' on your instance may not return what you expect. See Moose::Object for
\&'\s-1DOES\s0'.
.PP
Additional params may be added to the new instance by providing
\&'rebless_params'. See Moose::Meta::Role::Application::ToInstance.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
Role support has only a few caveats:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Roles cannot use the \f(CW\*(C`extends\*(C'\fR keyword; it will throw an exception for now.
The same is true of the \f(CW\*(C`augment\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`inner\*(C'\fR keywords (not sure those
really make sense for roles). All other Moose keywords will be \fIdeferred\fR
so that they can be applied to the consuming class.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Role composition does its best to \fBnot\fR be order-sensitive when it comes to
conflict resolution and requirements detection. However, it is order-sensitive
when it comes to method modifiers. All before/around/after modifiers are
included whenever a role is composed into a class, and then applied in the order
in which the roles are used. This also means that there is no conflict for
before/around/after modifiers.
.Sp
In most cases, this will be a non-issue; however, it is something to keep in
mind when using method modifiers in a role. You should never assume any
ordering.

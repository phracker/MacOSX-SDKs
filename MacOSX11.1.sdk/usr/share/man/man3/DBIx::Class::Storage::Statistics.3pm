.SH "NAME"
DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics \- SQL Statistics
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This class is called by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI as a means of collecting
statistics on its actions.  Using this class alone merely prints the \s-1SQL\s0
executed, the fact that it completes and begin/end notification for
transactions.
.PP
To really use this class you should subclass it and create your own method
for collecting the statistics as discussed in DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS "new"
.IX Subsection "new"
Returns a new DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics object.
.SS "debugfh"
.IX Subsection "debugfh"
Sets or retrieves the filehandle used for trace/debug output.  This should
be an IO::Handle compatible object (only the
print method is used). By
default it is initially set to \s-1STDERR\s0 \- although see discussion of the
\&\s-1DBIC_TRACE\s0 environment variable.
.PP
Invoked as a getter it will lazily open a filehandle and set it to
autoflush (if one is not
already set).
.SS "print"
.IX Subsection "print"
Prints the specified string to our debugging filehandle.  Provided to save our
methods the worry of how to display the message.
.SS "silence"
.IX Subsection "silence"
Turn off all output if set to true.
.SS "txn_begin"
.IX Subsection "txn_begin"
Called when a transaction begins.
.SS "txn_rollback"
.IX Subsection "txn_rollback"
Called when a transaction is rolled back.
.SS "txn_commit"
.IX Subsection "txn_commit"
Called when a transaction is committed.
.SS "svp_begin"
.IX Subsection "svp_begin"
Called when a savepoint is created.
.SS "svp_release"
.IX Subsection "svp_release"
Called when a savepoint is released.
.SS "svp_rollback"
.IX Subsection "svp_rollback"
Called when rolling back to a savepoint.
.SS "query_start"
.IX Subsection "query_start"
Called before a query is executed.  The first argument is the \s-1SQL\s0 string being
executed and subsequent arguments are the parameters used for the query.
.SS "query_end"
.IX Subsection "query_end"
Called when a query finishes executing.  Has the same arguments as query_start.

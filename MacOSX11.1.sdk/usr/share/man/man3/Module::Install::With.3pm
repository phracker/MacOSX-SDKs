Module::Install::With \- find environnement for Module::Install
.SS "interactive"
.IX Subsection "interactive"
The \f(CW\*(C`interactive\*(C'\fR function tests for an install that has a user present
(or at least, one in which it is reasonable for us to present prompts
and other similar types of things).
.PP
Returns true if in an interactive environment, or false otherwise.
.SS "automated_testing"
.IX Subsection "automated_testing"
Are we currently running in an automated testing environment, such as
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 Testers.
.PP
This is primarily a cleaner and more human-readable equivalent of
checking \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1AUTOMATED_TESTING\s0} yourself, but may be improved in line
with best practices at a later date.
.SS "release_testing"
.IX Subsection "release_testing"
Are we currently running in an release testing environment. That is,
are we in the process of running in a potential highly-intensive and
high dependency bloat testing process prior to packaging a module for
release.
.PP
This is primarily a cleaner and more human-readable equivalent of
checking \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1RELEASE_TESTING\s0} yourself, but may be improved in line
with best practices at a later date.
.SS "win32"
.IX Subsection "win32"
The \f(CW\*(C`win32\*(C'\fR function tests if the Makefile.PL is currently running in a
native Microsoft Windows Perl, such as ActivePerl or Strawberry Perl.
.PP
This is primarily a cleaner and more human-readable equivalent of
checking \f(CW\*(C`$^O eq \*(AqMSWin32\*(Aq\*(C'\fR yourself, but may be improved in line
with best practices at a later date.
.SS "winlike"
.IX Subsection "winlike"
The \f(CW\*(C`winlike\*(C'\fR function tests if the Makefile.PL is currently running
in a Microsoft Windows Perl, under either cygwin or a native Win32 Perl.
.PP
This is primarily a cleaner and more human-readable equivalent of
checking \f(CW\*(C`$^O eq \*(AqMSWin32\*(Aq or $^O eq \*(Aqcygwin\*(Aq\*(C'\fRyourself, but may be
improved in line with best practices at a later date.

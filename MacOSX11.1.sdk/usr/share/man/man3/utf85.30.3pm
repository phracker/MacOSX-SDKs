.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \f(CW\*(C`use utf8\*(C'\fR pragma tells the Perl parser to allow \s-1UTF\-8\s0 in the
program text in the current lexical scope.  The \f(CW\*(C`no utf8\*(C'\fR pragma tells Perl
to switch back to treating the source text as literal bytes in the current
lexical scope.  (On \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms, technically it is allowing UTF-EBCDIC,
and not \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 but this distinction is academic, so in this document the term
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 is used to mean both).
.PP
\&\fBDo not use this pragma for anything else than telling Perl that your
script is written in \s-1UTF\-8.\s0\fR The utility functions described below are
directly usable without \f(CW\*(C`use utf8;\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Because it is not possible to reliably tell \s-1UTF\-8\s0 from native 8 bit
encodings, you need either a Byte Order Mark at the beginning of your
source code, or \f(CW\*(C`use utf8;\*(C'\fR, to instruct perl.
.PP
When \s-1UTF\-8\s0 becomes the standard source format, this pragma will
effectively become a no-op.
.PP
See also the effects of the \f(CW\*(C`\-C\*(C'\fR switch and its cousin, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_UNICODE\*(C'\fR environment variable, in perlrun.
.PP
Enabling the \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR pragma has the following effect:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Bytes in the source text that are not in the \s-1ASCII\s0 character set will be
treated as being part of a literal \s-1UTF\-8\s0 sequence.  This includes most
literals such as identifier names, string constants, and constant
regular expression patterns.
.PP
Note that if you have non-ASCII, non\-UTF\-8 bytes in your script (for example
embedded Latin\-1 in your string literals), \f(CW\*(C`use utf8\*(C'\fR will be unhappy.  If
you want to have such bytes under \f(CW\*(C`use utf8\*(C'\fR, you can disable this pragma
until the end the block (or file, if at top level) by \f(CW\*(C`no utf8;\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Utility functions"
.IX Subsection "Utility functions"
The following functions are defined in the \f(CW\*(C`utf8::\*(C'\fR package by the
Perl core.  You do not need to say \f(CW\*(C`use utf8\*(C'\fR to use these and in fact
you should not say that unless you really want to have \s-1UTF\-8\s0 source code.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$num_octets = utf8::upgrade($string)\*(C'\fR
.Sp
(Since Perl v5.8.0)
Converts in-place the internal representation of the string from an octet
sequence in the native encoding (Latin\-1 or \s-1EBCDIC\s0) to \s-1UTF\-8.\s0 The
logical character sequence itself is unchanged.  If \fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR is already
upgraded, then this is a no-op. Returns the
number of octets necessary to represent the string as \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
.Sp
If your code needs to be compatible with versions of perl without
\&\f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR, you can force Unicode semantics on
a given string:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  # force unicode semantics for $string without the
\&  # "unicode_strings" feature
\&  utf8::upgrade($string);
.Ve
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  # without explicit or implicit use feature \*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq
\&  my $x = "\exDF";    # LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S
\&  $x =~ /ss/i;       # won\*(Aqt match
\&  my $y = uc($x);    # won\*(Aqt convert
\&  utf8::upgrade($x);
\&  $x =~ /ss/i;       # matches
\&  my $z = uc($x);    # converts to "SS"
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBNote that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings\fR;
use Encode instead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$success = utf8::downgrade($string[, $fail_ok])\*(C'\fR
.Sp
(Since Perl v5.8.0)
Converts in-place the internal representation of the string from \s-1UTF\-8\s0 to the
equivalent octet sequence in the native encoding (Latin\-1 or \s-1EBCDIC\s0). The
logical character sequence itself is unchanged. If \fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR is already
stored as native 8 bit, then this is a no-op.  Can be used to make sure that
the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 flag is off, e.g. when you want to make sure that the \fBsubstr()\fR or
\&\fBlength()\fR function works with the usually faster byte algorithm.
.Sp
Fails if the original \s-1UTF\-8\s0 sequence cannot be represented in the
native 8 bit encoding. On failure dies or, if the value of \fI\f(CI$fail_ok\fI\fR is
true, returns false.
.Sp
Returns true on success.
.Sp
If your code expects an octet sequence this can be used to validate
that you've received one:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  # throw an exception if not representable as octets
\&  utf8::downgrade($string)
\&
\&  # or do your own error handling
\&  utf8::downgrade($string, 1) or die "string must be octets";
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBNote that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings\fR;
use Encode instead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::encode($string)\*(C'\fR
.Sp
(Since Perl v5.8.0)
Converts in-place the character sequence to the corresponding octet
sequence in Perl's extended \s-1UTF\-8.\s0 That is, every (possibly wide) character
gets replaced with a sequence of one or more characters that represent the
individual \s-1UTF\-8\s0 bytes of the character.  The \s-1UTF8\s0 flag is turned off.
Returns nothing.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& my $x = "\ex{100}"; # $x contains one character, with ord 0x100
\& utf8::encode($x);  # $x contains two characters, with ords (on
\&                    # ASCII platforms) 0xc4 and 0x80.  On EBCDIC
\&                    # 1047, this would instead be 0x8C and 0x41.
.Ve
.Sp
Similar to:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  use Encode;
\&  $x = Encode::encode("utf8", $x);
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBNote that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings\fR;
use Encode instead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$success = utf8::decode($string)\*(C'\fR
.Sp
(Since Perl v5.8.0)
Attempts to convert in-place the octet sequence encoded in Perl's extended
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 to the corresponding character sequence. That is, it replaces each
sequence of characters in the string whose ords represent a valid (extended)
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 byte sequence, with the corresponding single character.  The \s-1UTF\-8\s0 flag
is turned on only if the source string contains multiple-byte \s-1UTF\-8\s0
characters.  If \fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR is invalid as extended \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 returns false;
otherwise returns true.
.Sp
.Vb 6
\& my $x = "\exc4\ex80"; # $x contains two characters, with ords
\&                     # 0xc4 and 0x80
\& utf8::decode($x);   # On ASCII platforms, $x contains one char,
\&                     # with ord 0x100.   Since these bytes aren\*(Aqt
\&                     # legal UTF\-EBCDIC, on EBCDIC platforms, $x is
\&                     # unchanged and the function returns FALSE.
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBNote that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings\fR;
use Encode instead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$unicode = utf8::native_to_unicode($code_point)\*(C'\fR
.Sp
(Since Perl v5.8.0)
This takes an unsigned integer (which represents the ordinal number of a
character (or a code point) on the platform the program is being run on) and
returns its Unicode equivalent value.  Since \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms natively use the
Unicode code points, this function returns its input on them.  On \s-1EBCDIC\s0
platforms it converts from \s-1EBCDIC\s0 to Unicode.
.Sp
A meaningless value will currently be returned if the input is not an unsigned
integer.
.Sp
Since Perl v5.22.0, calls to this function are optimized out on \s-1ASCII\s0
platforms, so there is no performance hit in using it there.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$native = utf8::unicode_to_native($code_point)\*(C'\fR
.Sp
(Since Perl v5.8.0)
This is the inverse of \f(CW\*(C`utf8::native_to_unicode()\*(C'\fR, converting the other
direction.  Again, on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms, this returns its input, but on \s-1EBCDIC\s0
platforms it will find the native platform code point, given any Unicode one.
.Sp
A meaningless value will currently be returned if the input is not an unsigned
integer.
.Sp
Since Perl v5.22.0, calls to this function are optimized out on \s-1ASCII\s0
platforms, so there is no performance hit in using it there.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$flag = utf8::is_utf8($string)\*(C'\fR
.Sp
(Since Perl 5.8.1)  Test whether \fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR is marked internally as encoded in
\&\s-1UTF\-8.\s0  Functionally the same as \f(CW\*(C`Encode::is_utf8($string)\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Typically only necessary for debugging and testing, if you need to
dump the internals of an \s-1SV,\s0 Devel::Peek's \fBDump()\fR
provides more detail in a compact form.
.Sp
If you still think you need this outside of debugging, testing or
dealing with filenames, you should probably read perlunitut and
\&\*(L"What is \*(R"the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag\*(L"?\*(R" in perlunifaq.
.Sp
Don't use this flag as a marker to distinguish character and binary
data: that should be decided for each variable when you write your
code.
.Sp
To force unicode semantics in code portable to perl 5.8 and 5.10, call
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::upgrade($string)\*(C'\fR unconditionally.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$flag = utf8::valid($string)\*(C'\fR
.Sp
[\s-1INTERNAL\s0] Test whether \fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR is in a consistent state regarding
\&\s-1UTF\-8.\s0  Will return true if it is well-formed Perl extended \s-1UTF\-8\s0 and has the
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 flag
on \fBor\fR if \fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR is held as bytes (both these states are 'consistent').
The main reason for this routine is to allow Perl's test suite to check
that operations have left strings in a consistent state.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::encode\*(C'\fR is like \f(CW\*(C`utf8::upgrade\*(C'\fR, but the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag is
cleared.  See perlunicode, and the C \s-1API\s0
functions \f(CW\*(C`sv_utf8_upgrade\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`"sv_utf8_downgrade" in perlapi\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`"sv_utf8_encode" in perlapi\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`"sv_utf8_decode" in perlapi\*(C'\fR, which are wrapped by the Perl functions
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::upgrade\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8::downgrade\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8::encode\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::decode\*(C'\fR.  Also, the functions \f(CW\*(C`utf8::is_utf8\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8::valid\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::encode\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8::decode\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8::upgrade\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`utf8::downgrade\*(C'\fR are
actually internal, and thus always available, without a \f(CW\*(C`require utf8\*(C'\fR
statement.

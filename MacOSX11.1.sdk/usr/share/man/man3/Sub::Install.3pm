.SH "NAME"
Sub::Install \- install subroutines into packages easily
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 0.928
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&  use Sub::Install;
\&
\&  Sub::Install::install_sub({
\&    code => sub { ... },
\&    into => $package,
\&    as   => $subname
\&  });
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module makes it easy to install subroutines into packages without the
unsightly mess of \f(CW\*(C`no strict\*(C'\fR or typeglobs lying about where just anyone can
see them.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
.SS "install_sub"
.IX Subsection "install_sub"
.Vb 5
\&  Sub::Install::install_sub({
\&   code => \e&subroutine,
\&   into => "Finance::Shady",
\&   as   => \*(Aqlaunder\*(Aq,
\&  });
.Ve
.PP
This routine installs a given code reference into a package as a normal
subroutine.  The above is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  no strict \*(Aqrefs\*(Aq;
\&  *{"Finance::Shady" . \*(Aq::\*(Aq . "launder"} = \e&subroutine;
.Ve
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`into\*(C'\fR is not given, the sub is installed into the calling package.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`code\*(C'\fR is not a code reference, it is looked for as an existing sub in the
package named in the \f(CW\*(C`from\*(C'\fR parameter.  If \f(CW\*(C`from\*(C'\fR is not given, it will look
in the calling package.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`as\*(C'\fR is not given, and if \f(CW\*(C`code\*(C'\fR is a name, \f(CW\*(C`as\*(C'\fR will default to \f(CW\*(C`code\*(C'\fR.
If \f(CW\*(C`as\*(C'\fR is not given, but if \f(CW\*(C`code\*(C'\fR is a code ref, Sub::Install will try to
find the name of the given code ref and use that as \f(CW\*(C`as\*(C'\fR.
.PP
That means that this code:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  Sub::Install::install_sub({
\&    code => \*(Aqtwitch\*(Aq,
\&    from => \*(AqPerson::InPain\*(Aq,
\&    into => \*(AqPerson::Teenager\*(Aq,
\&    as   => \*(Aqdance\*(Aq,
\&  });
.Ve
.PP
is the same as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  package Person::Teenager;
\&
\&  Sub::Install::install_sub({
\&    code => Person::InPain\->can(\*(Aqtwitch\*(Aq),
\&    as   => \*(Aqdance\*(Aq,
\&  });
.Ve
.SS "reinstall_sub"
.IX Subsection "reinstall_sub"
This routine behaves exactly like \f(CW"install_sub"\fR, but does not emit a
warning if warnings are on and the destination is already defined.
.SS "install_installers"
.IX Subsection "install_installers"
This routine is provided to allow Sub::Install compatibility with
Sub::Installer.  It installs \f(CW\*(C`install_sub\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`reinstall_sub\*(C'\fR methods into
the package named by its argument.
.PP
.Vb 2
\& Sub::Install::install_installers(\*(AqCode::Builder\*(Aq); # just for us, please
\& Code::Builder\->install_sub({ name => $code_ref });
\&
\& Sub::Install::install_installers(\*(AqUNIVERSAL\*(Aq); # feeling lucky, punk?
\& Anything::At::All\->install_sub({ name => $code_ref });
.Ve
.PP
The installed installers are similar, but not identical, to those provided by
Sub::Installer.  They accept a single hash as an argument.  The key/value pairs
are used as the \f(CW\*(C`as\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`code\*(C'\fR parameters to the \f(CW\*(C`install_sub\*(C'\fR routine
detailed above.  The package name on which the method is called is used as the
\&\f(CW\*(C`into\*(C'\fR parameter.
.PP
Unlike Sub::Installer's \f(CW\*(C`install_sub\*(C'\fR will not eval strings into code, but
will look for named code in the calling package.
.SH "EXPORTS"
.IX Header "EXPORTS"
Sub::Install exports \f(CW\*(C`install_sub\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`reinstall_sub\*(C'\fR only if they are
requested.
.SS "exporter"
.IX Subsection "exporter"
Sub::Install has a never-exported subroutine called \f(CW\*(C`exporter\*(C'\fR, which is used
to implement its \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR routine.  It takes a hashref of named arguments,
only one of which is currently recognize: \f(CW\*(C`exports\*(C'\fR.  This must be an arrayref
of subroutines to offer for export.
.PP
This routine is mainly for Sub::Install's own consumption.  Instead, consider
Sub::Exporter.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IX Header "SEE ALSO"
.IP "Sub::Installer" 4
.IX Item "Sub::Installer"
This module is (obviously) a reaction to Damian Conway's Sub::Installer, which
does the same thing, but does it by getting its greasy fingers all over
\&\s-1UNIVERSAL.\s0  I was really happy about the idea of making the installation of
coderefs less ugly, but I couldn't bring myself to replace the ugliness of
typeglobs and loosened strictures with the ugliness of \s-1UNIVERSAL\s0 methods.
.IP "Sub::Exporter" 4
.IX Item "Sub::Exporter"
This is a complete Exporter.pm replacement, built atop Sub::Install.
.SH "EXTRA CREDITS"
.IX Header "EXTRA CREDITS"
Several of the tests are adapted from tests that shipped with Damian Conway's
Sub-Installer distribution.

.Nd FileVault enabling tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar verb
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to enable or disable FileVault, to list, add, or remove enabled FileVault users, and to obtain status about the current state of FileVault. Most commands require root access and need to be authenticated with either a FileVault password, a personal recovery key (if enabled), and in some cases the private key from the installed institutional recovery key.  Some status related commands can be run from a non-root session.
.Pp
By default, when enabling FileVault
.Nm
will only return a personal recovery key. Given the proper certificate information, 
.Nm
can install an institutional recovery key.  You can also set it up without a personal recovery key using the
.Sy -norecoverykey
option, though this is not recommended unless you are also installing an institutional recovery key.   Either type of keys can be added or changed at a later time.
.Pp
Data passed in via stdin should be a property list using the example format described later. When enabling FileVault, the top level Username and Password key values must be for an existing MacOS X user. For other commands that require authentication, the top level Username key is ignored, and the Password key value should either be an existing FileVault user password or the personal recovery key (in the example form "AU2A-PHMK-WBGX-PWKX-M3X3-VAPY"). If a password is not in the property list,
.Nm
will prompt the user for it.  Added Username parameters should be short names of existing users.  Some commands allow you to authenticate and unlock by providing the
.Sy -key 
option followed by the path to a keychain file containing the private key of the institutional recovery key.  Do not include the certificate in this keychain.
.Pp
With the
.Sy -keychain
option, an institutional recovery key can be set up by placing an X.509 asymmetric public certificate in the /Library/Keychains/FileVaultMaster.keychain file. \fBsecurity create-filevaultmaster-keychain\fP can be used to create the keychain. Alternatively a certificate can be passed in by using the
.Sy -certificate 
option and entering the path to the DER encoded certificate file. In this case the FileVaultMaster.keychain file will be created using the certificate. With your .cer file, the optional certificate data can be obtained using the base64 tool.  For example: 'base64 /path/to/mycert.cer > /mynewdata.txt', at which point you would copy the data string contained in the text file and place it into the Certificate <data></data> value area of the property list.
.Pp
The
.Sy status
command will indicate if FileVault is On or Off.  If a FileVault master keychain is installed into the /Library/Keychains folder it will also report this back.  Note that this, by itself, does not indicate whether or not FileVault has been set up with an institutional recovery key.  Use the
.Sy hasinstitutionalrecoverykey
command to see if the institutional recovery key is active.
.Pp
The
.Sy list
command will display the short names and UUIDs of any enabled FileVault users. The
.Sy remove
command will remove a user from FileVault.
.Pp
The
.Sy syncusers
command synchronizes Open Directory attributes (e.g. user pictures) with FileVault users, and removes FileVault users that were removed from Open Directory.   In most cases these changes will already be updated in FileVault.  
.Sy syncusers
does not add users to FileVault.
.Pp
Use the
.Sy haspersonalrecoverykey
or
.Sy hasinstitutionalrecoverykey
commands to see if FileVault has a personal or institutional recovery key set up.  If FileVault is active and the key is set, these commands will return "true", otherwise they will return "false".  Note that "false" may also be returned if any error occurs.
.Pp
If a user currently has the system unlocked using the recovery key, the
.Sy usingrecoverykey
command will return "true".
.Pp
The
.Sy changerecovery
command changes or adds either the personal or institutional recovery key.  You can only have one recovery key of each type, so any associated existing key will be removed.  The
.Sy removerecovery
command will remove any existing recovery key of the type specified.  It is not recommended that you remove all recovery keys since, if you lose your FileVault password, you may not be able to access your information.
.Pp
On supported hardware,
.Nm
allows restart of a FileVault-enabled system without requiring
unlock during the subsequent boot using the
.Sy authrestart
command. WARNING: FileVault protections
are reduced during authenticated restarts. In particular,
.Nm
deliberately stores at least one additional copy of a permanent FDE (full disk encryption)
unlock key in both system memory and (on supported systems) the
System Management Controller (SMC).
.Nm
must be run as root and itself prompts for a password to unlock the
FileVault root volume.  Use
.Sy pmset destroyfvkeyonstandby
to prevent saving the key across standby modes. Once 
.Sy authrestart
is authenticated, it launches
.Xr reboot 8
and, upon successful unlock, the unlock key will be removed.  You can also use this as an option to the
.Sy enable
command if the system supports this feature.  The
.Sy supportsauthrestart
command will check the system to see if it supports this option.

.Pp
.It Fl norecoverykey

.El
.Sh DEFERRED ENABLEMENT
.Pp
The
.Sy -defer
option can be used with the
.Sy enable
command option to delay enabling FileVault until after the current (or next) user logs out, thus avoiding the need to enter a password when the tool is run. The user will be prompted at logout time for the password, at which point an attempt will be made to enable FileVault. If the volume is not already a CoreStorage volume, the system may need to be restarted to start the encryption process. Logout dialogs are automatically dismissed and canceled after 60 seconds if no interaction occurs and the user will be prompted again at the next logout time.
.Pp
The
.Sy -defer
option sets up a single user to be added to FileVault. If there was no user specified (e.g. without the
.Sy -user
option), then the currently logged in user will be added to the configuration and becomes the designated user. If there is no user specified and no users are logged in at the time of configuration, then the next user that logs in will be used as the designated user.
.Pp
As recovery key information is not generated until the user password is obtained, the
.Sy -defer
option requires a path where this information will be written to. The property list file will be created as a root-only readable file and should be placed in a secure location.  You can use the
.Sy showdeferralinfo
command to view the current deferral configuration information.
.Pp
Options that can be used in conjunction with the
.Sy -defer
option include: 
.Sy -keychain,
.Sy -certificate,
.Sy -forcerestart,
.Sy -user,
and 
.Sy -norecoverykey.
.Pp
Note that if the designated user doesn't complete the setup at logout, FileVault will not be enabled, and the configuration will remain and be used again for the designated user's next logout, thereby 'nagging' the user to enable FileVault. To remove an active deferred enablement configuration, you can use the
.Sy disable
command, even if FileVault is not currently enabled.

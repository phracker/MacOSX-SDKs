.SH "NAME"
perluniprops \- Index of Unicode Version 5.2.0 properties in Perl
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
There are many properties in Unicode, and Perl provides access to almost all of
them, as well as some additional extensions and short-cut synonyms.
.PP
And just about all of the few that aren't accessible through the Perl
core are accessible through the modules: Unicode::Normalize and
Unicode::UCD, and for Unihan properties, via the \s-1CPAN\s0 module Unicode::Unihan.
.PP
This document merely lists all available properties and does not attempt to
explain what each property really means.  There is a brief description of each
Perl extension.  There is some detail about Blocks, Scripts, General_Category,
and Bidi_Class in perlunicode, but to find out about the intricacies of the
Unicode properties, refer to the Unicode standard.  A good starting place is
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/>.  More information on the Perl extensions is in
perlrecharclass.
.PP
Note that you can define your own properties; see
\&\*(L"User-Defined Character Properties\*(R" in perlunicode.
.SH "Properties accessible through \ep{} and \eP{}"
.IX Header "Properties accessible through p{} and P{}"
The Perl regular expression \ep{} and \eP{} constructs give access to most of
the Unicode character properties.  The table below shows all these constructs,
both single and compound forms.
.PP
\&\fBCompound forms\fR consist of two components, separated by an equals sign or a
colon.  The first component is the property name, and the second component is
the particular value of the property to match against, for example,
\&'\ep{Script: Greek}' or '\ep{Script=Greek}' both mean to match characters
whose Script property is Greek.
.PP
\&\fBSingle forms\fR, like '\ep{Greek}', are mostly Perl-defined shortcuts for
their equivalent compound forms.  The table shows these equivalences.  (In our
example, '\ep{Greek}' is a just a shortcut for '\ep{Script=Greek}'.)
There are also a few Perl-defined single forms that are not shortcuts for a
compound form.  One such is \ep{Word}.  These are also listed in the table.
.PP
In parsing these constructs, Perl always ignores Upper/lower case differences
everywhere within the {braces}.  Thus '\ep{Greek}' means the same thing as
\&'\ep{greek}'.  But note that changing the case of the 'p' or 'P' before the
left brace completely changes the meaning of the construct, from \*(L"match\*(R" (for
\&'\ep{}') to \*(L"doesn't match\*(R" (for '\eP{}').  Casing in this document is for
improved legibility.
.PP
Also, white space, hyphens, and underscores are also normally ignored
everywhere between the {braces}, and hence can be freely added or removed
even if the \f(CW\*(C`/x\*(C'\fR modifier hasn't been specified on the regular expression.
But a '\fBT\fR' at the beginning of an entry in the table below
means that tighter (stricter) rules are used for that entry:
.IP "Single form (\ep{name}) tighter rules:" 4
.IX Item "Single form (p{name}) tighter rules:"
White space, hyphens, and underscores \s-1ARE\s0 significant
except for:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
white space adjacent to a non-word character
.IP "\(bu" 4
underscores separating digits in numbers
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
That means, for example, that you can freely add or remove white space
adjacent to (but within) the braces without affecting the meaning.
.RE
.IP "Compound form (\ep{name=value} or \ep{name:value}) tighter rules:" 4
.IX Item "Compound form (p{name=value} or p{name:value}) tighter rules:"
The tighter rules given above for the single form apply to everything to the
right of the colon or equals; the looser rules still apply to everything to
the left.
.Sp
That means, for example, that you can freely add or remove white space
adjacent to (but within) the braces and the colon or equal sign.
.PP
Some properties are considered obsolete, but still available.  There are
several varieties of obsolesence:
.IP "Obsolete" 4
.IX Item "Obsolete"
Properties marked with an '\fBO\fR' in the table are considered
obsolete.  At the time of this writing (Unicode version 5.2) there is no
information in the Unicode standard about the implications of a property being
obsolete.
.IP "Stabilized" 4
.IX Item "Stabilized"
Obsolete properties may be stabilized.  This means that they are not actively
maintained by Unicode, and will not be extended as new characters are added to
the standard.  Such properties are marked with an '\fBS\fR' in the
table.  At the time of this writing (Unicode version 5.2) there is no further
information in the Unicode standard about the implications of a property being
stabilized.
.IP "Deprecated" 4
.IX Item "Deprecated"
Obsolete properties may be deprecated.  This means that their use is strongly
discouraged, so much so that a warning will be issued if used, unless the
regular expression is in the scope of a \f(CW\*(C`no\ warnings\ \*(Aqdeprecated\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
statement.  A '\fBD\fR' flags each such entry in the table, and
the entry there for the longest, most descriptive version of the property will
give the reason it is deprecated, and perhaps advice.  Perl may issue such a
warning, even for properties that aren't officially deprecated by Unicode,
when there used to be characters or code points that were matched by them, but
no longer.  This is to warn you that your program may not work like it did on
earlier Unicode releases.
.Sp
A deprecated property may be made unavailable in a future Perl version, so it
is best to move away from them.
.PP
Some Perl extensions are present for backwards compatibility and are
discouraged from being used, but not obsolete.  An '\fBX\fR'
flags each such entry in the table.
.PP
Matches in the Block property have shortcuts that begin with 'In_'.  For
example, \ep{Block=Latin1} can be written as \ep{In_Latin1}.  For backward
compatibility, if there is no conflict with another shortcut, these may also
be written as \ep{Latin1} or \ep{Is_Latin1}.  But, N.B., there are numerous
such conflicting shortcuts.  Use of these forms for Block is discouraged, and
are flagged as such, not only because of the potential confusion as to what is
meant, but also because a later release of Unicode may preempt the shortcut,
and your program would no longer be correct.  Use the 'In_' form instead to
avoid this, or even more clearly, use the compound form, e.g.,
\&\ep{blk:latin1}.  See \*(L"Blocks\*(R" in perlunicode for more information about this.
.PP
The table below has two columns.  The left column contains the \ep{}
constructs to look up, possibly preceeded by the flags mentioned above; and
the right column contains information about them, like a description, or
synonyms.  It shows both the single and compound forms for each property that
has them.  If the left column is a short name for a property, the right column
will give its longer, more descriptive name; and if the left column is the
longest name, the right column will show any equivalent shortest name, in both
single and compound forms if applicable.
.PP
The right column will also caution you if a property means something different
than what might normally be expected.
.PP
All single forms are Perl extensions; a few compound forms are as well, and
are noted as such.
.PP
Numbers in (parentheses) indicate the total number of code points matched by
the property.  For emphasis, those properties that match no code points at all
are listed as well in a separate section following the table.
.PP
There is no description given for most non-Perl defined properties (See
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/ for that).
.PP
For compactness, '\fB*\fR' is used as a wildcard instead of showing all possible
combinations.  For example, entries like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& \ep{Gc: *}                                  \ep{General_Category: *}
.Ve
.PP
mean that 'Gc' is a synonym for 'General_Category', and anything that is valid
for the latter is also valid for the former.  Similarly,
.PP
.Vb 1
\& \ep{Is_*}                                   \ep{*}
.Ve
.PP
means that if and only if, for example, \ep{Foo} exists, then \ep{Is_Foo} and
\&\ep{IsFoo} are also valid and all mean the same thing.  And similarly,
\&\ep{Foo=Bar} means the same as \ep{Is_Foo=Bar} and \ep{IsFoo=Bar}.  '*' here
is restricted to something not beginning with an underscore.
.PP
Also, in binary properties, 'Yes', 'T', and 'True' are all synonyms for 'Y'.
And 'No', 'F', and 'False' are all synonyms for 'N'.  The table shows 'Y*' and
\&'N*' to indicate this, and doesn't have separate entries for the other
possibilities.  Note that not all properties which have values 'Yes' and 'No'
are binary, and they have all their values spelled out without using this wild
card, and a \f(CW\*(C`NOT\*(C'\fR clause in their description that highlights their not being
binary.  These also require the compound form to match them, whereas true
binary properties have both single and compound forms available.
.PP
Note that all non-essential underscores are removed in the display of the
short names below.

.SS "Legal \ep{} and \eP{} constructs that match no characters"
.IX Subsection "Legal p{} and P{} constructs that match no characters"
Unicode has some property-value pairs that currently don't match anything.
This happens generally either because they are obsolete, or for symmetry with
other forms, but no language has yet been encoded that uses them.  In this
version of Unicode, the following match zero code points:
.IP "\ep{Canonical_Combining_Class=Attached_Below_Left}" 4

.SH "Properties not accessible through \ep{} and \eP{}"
.IX Header "Properties not accessible through p{} and P{}"
A few properties are accessible in Perl via various function calls only.
These are:
 Lowercase_Mapping          \fIlc()\fR and \fIlcfirst()\fR
 Titlecase_Mapping          \fIucfirst()\fR
 Uppercase_Mapping          \fIuc()\fR
.PP
Case_Folding is accessible through the /i modifier in regular expressions.
.PP
The Name property is accessible through the \eN{} interpolation in
double-quoted strings and regular expressions, but both usages require a \f(CW\*(C`use
charnames;\*(C'\fR to be specified, which also contains related functions \fIviacode()\fR
and \fIvianame()\fR.
.SH "Unicode regular expression properties that are NOT accepted by Perl"
.IX Header "Unicode regular expression properties that are NOT accepted by Perl"
Perl will generate an error for a few character properties in Unicode when
used in a regular expression.  The non-Unihan ones are listed below, with the
reasons they are not accepted, perhaps with work-arounds.  The short names for
the properties are listed enclosed in (parentheses).

Obsolete.  All code points previously matched by this have been moved to \*(L"Script=Common\*(R"
.PP
An installation can choose to allow any of these to be matched by changing the
controlling lists contained in the program \f(CW$Config{privlib}\fR/\fIunicore/lib/unicore/mktables\fR
and then re-running \fIlib/unicore/mktables\fR.  (\f(CW%Config\fR is available from the Config module).
.SH "Files in the \fITo\fP directory (for serious hackers only)"
.IX Header "Files in the To directory (for serious hackers only)"
All Unicode properties are really mappings (in the mathematical sense) from
code points to their respective values.  As part of its build process,
Perl constructs tables containing these mappings for all properties that it
deals with.  But only a few of these are written out into files.
Those written out are in the directory \f(CW$Config{privlib}\fR/\fIunicore/To/\fR
(%Config is available from the Config module).
.PP
Those ones written are ones needed by Perl internally during execution, or for
which there is some demand, and those for which there is no access through the
Perl core.  Generally, properties that can be used in regular expression
matching do not have their map tables written, like Script.  Nor are the
simplistic properties that have a better, more complete version, such as
Simple_Uppercase_Mapping  (Uppercase_Mapping is written instead).
.PP
None of the properties in the \fITo\fR directory are currently directly
accessible through the Perl core, although some may be accessed indirectly.
For example, the \fIuc()\fR function implements the Uppercase_Mapping property and
uses the \fIUpper.pl\fR file found in this directory.
.PP
The available files with their properties (short names in parentheses),
and any flags or comments about them, are:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&   Bmg.pl           Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph (bmg)
\&   Digit.pl         Perl_Decimal_Digit
\&   Fold.pl          Case_Folding (cf)
\&   Lower.pl         Lowercase_Mapping (lc)
\&   NFKCCF.pl        NFKC_Casefold (NFKC_CF)
\&   Title.pl         Titlecase_Mapping (tc)
\&   Upper.pl         Uppercase_Mapping (uc)
.Ve
.PP
An installation can choose to change which files are generated by changing the
controlling lists contained in the program \f(CW$Config{privlib}\fR/\fIunicore/lib/unicore/mktables\fR
and then re-running \fIlib/unicore/mktables\fR.
.PP
Each of these files defines two hash entries to help reading programs decipher
it.  One of them looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $utf8::SwashInfo{\*(AqToNAME\*(Aq}{\*(Aqformat\*(Aq} = \*(Aqs\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
where '\s-1NAME\s0' is a name to indicate the property.  For backwards compatibility,
this is not necessarily the property's official Unicode name.  (The 'To' is
also for backwards compatibility.)  The hash entry gives the format of the
mapping fields of the table, currently one of the following:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  b    binary
\&  d    single decimal digit
\&  f    floating point number
\&  i    integer
\&  r    rational: an integer or a fraction
\&  s    arbitrary string
\&  x    positive hex whole number; a code point
.Ve
.PP
This format applies only to the entries in the main body of the table.
Entries defined in hashes or ones that are missing from the list can have a
different format.
.PP
The value that the missing entries have is given by the other SwashInfo hash
entry line; it looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $utf8::SwashInfo{\*(AqToNAME\*(Aq}{\*(Aqmissing\*(Aq} = \*(AqNaN\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
This example line says that any Unicode code points not explicitly listed in
the file have the value 'NaN' under the property indicated by \s-1NAME\s0.  If the
value is the special string \f(CW\*(C`<code point>\*(C'\fR, it means that the value for
any missing code point is the code point itself.  This happens, for example,
in the file for Uppercase_Mapping (To/Upper.pl), in which code points like the
character 'A', are missing because the uppercase of 'A' is itself.

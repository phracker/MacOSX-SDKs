.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The Zsh source distribution includes a number of items contributed by the
user community\&.  These are not inherently a part of the shell, and some
may not be available in every zsh installation\&.  The most significant of
these are documented here\&.  For documentation on other contributed items
such as shell functions, look for comments in the function source files\&.

.SS "Accessing On\-Line Help"
.PP
The key sequence \fBESC h\fP is normally bound by ZLE to execute the
\fBrun\-help\fP widget (see
\fIzshzle\fP(1))\&.  This invokes the \fBrun\-help\fP command with the command word from the
current input line as its argument\&.  By default, \fBrun\-help\fP is an alias
for the \fBman\fP command, so this often fails when the command word is a
shell builtin or a user\-defined function\&.  By redefining the \fBrun\-help\fP
alias, one can improve the on\-line help provided by the shell\&.
.PP
The \fBhelpfiles\fP utility, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh manual
to produce a separate help file for each shell builtin and for many other
shell features as well\&.  The autoloadable \fBrun\-help\fP function, found in
\fBFunctions/Misc\fP, searches for these helpfiles and performs several
other tests to produce the most complete help possible for the command\&.
.PP
There may already be a directory of help files on your system; look in
\fB/usr/share/zsh\fP or \fB/usr/local/share/zsh\fP and subdirectories below
those, or ask your system administrator\&.
.PP
To create your own help files with \fBhelpfiles\fP, choose or create a
directory where the individual command help files will reside\&.  For
example, you might choose \fB~/zsh_help\fP\&.  If you unpacked the zsh
distribution in your home directory, you would use the commands:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBmkdir ~/zsh_help
cd ~/zsh_help
man zshall | colcrt \- | \e 
perl ~/zsh\-5\&.0\&.2/Util/helpfiles\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Next, to use the \fBrun\-help\fP function, you need to add lines something
like the following to your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or equivalent startup file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBunalias run\-help
autoload run\-help
HELPDIR=~/zsh_help\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fBHELPDIR\fP parameter tells \fBrun\-help\fP where to look for the help
files\&.  If your system already has a help file directory installed, set
\fBHELPDIR\fP to the path of that directory instead\&.
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload run\-help\fP\&' to work, the \fBrun\-help\fP
file must be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/run\-help\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Recompiling Functions"
.PP
If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your zsh
installation to track the latest developments, you may find that function
digests compiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin are frequently out of date
with respect to the function source files\&.  This is not usually a problem,
because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a function, but
it may cause slower shell startup and function loading\&.  Also, if a digest
file is explicitly used as an element of \fBfpath\fP, zsh won\&'t check whether
any of its source files has changed\&.
.PP
The \fBzrecompile\fP autoloadable function, found in \fBFunctions/Misc\fP, can
be used to keep function digests up to date\&.

.TP
.PD
\fBzrecompile\fP [ \fB\-qt\fP ] \fB\-p\fP \fIargs\fP [ \fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP \fIargs\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
This tries to find \fB*\&.zwc\fP files and automatically re\-compile them if at
least one of the original files is newer than the compiled file\&.  This
works only if the names stored in the compiled files are full paths or are
relative to the directory that contains the \fB\&.zwc\fP file\&.
.RS
.PP
In the first form, each \fIname\fP is the name of a compiled file or a
directory containing \fB*\&.zwc\fP files that should be checked\&.  If no
arguments are given, the directories and \fB*\&.zwc\fP files in \fBfpath\fP are
used\&.
.PP
When \fB\-t\fP is given, no compilation is performed, but a return status of
zero (true) is set if there are files that need to be re\-compiled and
non\-zero (false) otherwise\&.  The \fB\-q\fP option quiets the chatty output
that describes what \fBzrecompile\fP is doing\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-t\fP option, the return status is zero if all files that
needed re\-compilation could be compiled and non\-zero if compilation for at
least one of the files failed\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-p\fP option is given, the \fIargs\fP are interpreted as one
or more sets of arguments for \fBzcompile\fP, separated by `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&'\&.
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzrecompile \-p \e 
           \-R ~/\&.zshrc \-\- \e 
           \-M ~/\&.zcompdump \-\- \e 
           ~/zsh/comp\&.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This compiles \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP into \fB~/\&.zshrc\&.zwc\fP if that doesn\&'t exist or
if it is older than \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP\&. The compiled file will be marked for
reading instead of mapping\&. The same is done for \fB~/\&.zcompdump\fP and
\fB~/\&.zcompdump\&.zwc\fP, but this compiled file is marked for mapping\&. The
last line re\-creates the file \fB~/zsh/comp\&.zwc\fP if any of the files
matching the given pattern is newer than it\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-p\fP option, \fBzrecompile\fP does not create function digests
that do not already exist, nor does it add new functions to the digest\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
The following shell loop is an example of a method for creating function
digests for all functions in your \fBfpath\fP, assuming that you have write
permission to the directories:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfor ((i=1; i <= $#fpath; ++i)); do
  dir=$fpath[i]
  zwc=${dir:t}\&.zwc
  if [[ $dir == (\&.|\&.\&.) || $dir == (\&.|\&.\&.)/* ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  files=($dir/*(N\-\&.))
  if [[ \-w $dir:h && \-n $files ]]; then
    files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})
    if ( cd $dir:h &&
         zrecompile \-p \-U \-z $zwc $files ); then
      fpath[i]=$fpath[i]\&.zwc
    fi
  fi
done\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fB\-U\fP and \fB\-z\fP options are appropriate for functions in the default
zsh installation \fBfpath\fP; you may need to use different options for your
personal function directories\&.
.PP
Once the digests have been created and your \fBfpath\fP modified to refer to
them, you can keep them up to date by running \fBzrecompile\fP with no
arguments\&.
.PP
.SS "Keyboard Definition"
.PP
The large number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations,
terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built\-in key bindings for every situation\&.  The \fBzkbd\fP utility,
found in Functions/Misc, can help you quickly create key bindings for your
configuration\&.
.PP
Run \fBzkbd\fP either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzsh \-f ~/zsh\-5\&.0\&.2/Functions/Misc/zkbd\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
When you run \fBzkbd\fP, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if
the default it offers is correct, just press return\&.  It then asks you to
press a number of different keys to determine characteristics of your
keyboard and terminal; \fBzkbd\fP warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither \fB^H\fP nor \fB^?\fP\&.
.PP
The keystrokes read by \fBzkbd\fP are recorded as a definition for an
associative array named \fBkey\fP, written to a file in the subdirectory
\fB\&.zkbd\fP within either your \fBHOME\fP or \fBZDOTDIR\fP directory\&.  The name
of the file is composed from the \fBTERM\fP, \fBVENDOR\fP and \fBOSTYPE\fP
parameters, joined by hyphens\&.
.PP
You may read this file into your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or another startup file with
the `\fBsource\fP\&' or `\fB\&.\fP' commands, then reference the \fBkey\fP parameter
in bindkey commands, like this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBsource ${ZDOTDIR:\-$HOME}/\&.zkbd/$TERM\-$VENDOR\-$OSTYPE
[[ \-n ${key[Left]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Left]}" backward\-char
[[ \-n ${key[Right]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Right]}" forward\-char
# etc\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload zkbd\fP\&' to work, the \fBzkdb\fP file must
be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/zkbd\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Dumping Shell State"
.PP
Occasionally you may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell,
particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh or a development
release\&.  Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the
problem to one of the zsh mailing lists (see
\fIzsh\fP(1)), but sometimes one of the zsh developers will need to recreate your
environment in order to track the problem down\&.
.PP
The script named \fBreporter\fP, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is provided for this purpose\&.  (It is also possible to
\fBautoload reporter\fP, but \fBreporter\fP is not installed in \fBfpath\fP
by default\&.)  This script outputs a detailed dump of the shell state,
in the form of another script that can be read with `\fBzsh \-f\fP\&' to
recreate that state\&.
.PP
To use \fBreporter\fP, read the script into your shell with the `\fB\&.\fP\&'
command and redirect the output into a file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\&. ~/zsh\-5\&.0\&.2/Util/reporter > zsh\&.report\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
You should check the \fBzsh\&.report\fP file for any sensitive information
such as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script to the
developers\&.  Also, as the output can be voluminous, it\&'s best to wait for
the developers to ask for this information before sending it\&.
.PP
You can also use \fBreporter\fP to dump only a subset of the shell state\&.
This is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time\&.
Most of the output from reporter is far more detailed than usually is
necessary for a startup file, but the \fBaliases\fP, \fBoptions\fP, and
\fBzstyles\fP states may be useful because they include only changes from
the defaults\&.  The \fBbindings\fP state may be useful if you have created
any of your own keymaps, because \fBreporter\fP arranges to dump the keymap
creation commands as well as the bindings for every keymap\&.
.PP
As is usual with automated tools, if you create a startup file with
\fBreporter\fP, you should edit the results to remove unnecessary commands\&.
Note that if you\&'re using the new completion system, you should \fInot\fP
dump the \fBfunctions\fP state to your startup files with \fBreporter\fP; use
the \fBcompdump\fP function instead (see
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1))\&.

.PD
\fBadd\-zsh\-hook\fP [\-dD] \fIhook\fP \fIfunction\fP
Several functions are special to the shell, as described in the section
SPECIAL FUNCTIONS, see \fIzshmisc\fP(1),
in that they are automatic called at a specific point during shell execution\&.
Each has an associated array consisting of names of functions to be
called at the same point; these are so\-called `hook functions\&'\&.
The shell function \fBadd\-zsh\-hook\fP provides a simple way of adding or
removing functions from the array\&.
.RS
.PP
\fIhook\fP is one of \fBchpwd\fP, \fBperiodic\fP, \fBprecmd\fP, \fBpreexec\fP,
\fBzshaddhistory\fP, \fBzshexit\fP, or \fBzsh_directory_name\fP,
the special functions in question\&.  Note that \fBzsh_directory_name\fP
is called in a different way from the other functions, but may
still be manipulated as a hook\&.
.PP
\fIfunction\fP is name of an ordinary shell function\&.  If no options
are given this will be added to the array of functions to be executed
in the given context\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-d\fP is given, the \fIfunction\fP is removed from
the array of functions to be executed\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-D\fP is given, the \fIfunction\fP is treated as a pattern
and any matching names of functions are removed from the array of
functions to be executed\&.
.PP
The options \fB\-U\fP, \fB\-z\fP and \fB\-k\fP are passed as arguments to
\fBautoload\fP for \fIfunction\fP\&.  For functions contributed with zsh, the
options \fB\-Uz\fP are appropriate\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
.SH "REMEMBERING RECENT DIRECTORIES"
.PP
The function \fBcdr\fP allows you to change the working directory to a
previous working directory from a list maintained automatically\&.  It is
similar in concept to the directory stack controlled by the \fBpushd\fP,
\fBpopd\fP and \fBdirs\fP builtins, but is more configurable, and as it stores
all entries in files it is maintained across sessions and (by default)
between terminal emulators in the current session\&.  (The \fBpushd\fP
directory stack is not actually modified or used by \fBcdr\fP unless you
configure it to do so as described in the configuration section below\&.)
.PP
.SS "Installation"
.PP
The system works by means of a hook function that is called every time the
directory changes\&.  To install the system, autoload the required functions
and use the \fBadd\-zsh\-hook\fP function described above:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBautoload \-Uz chpwd_recent_dirs cdr add\-zsh\-hook
add\-zsh\-hook chpwd chpwd_recent_dirs\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Now every time you change directly interactively, no matter which
command you use, the directory to which you change will be remembered
in most\-recent\-first order\&.
.PP
.SS "Use"
.PP
All direct user interaction is via the \fBcdr\fP function\&.
.PP
The argument to cdr is a number \fIN\fP corresponding to the \fIN\fPth most
recently changed\-to directory\&.  1 is the immediately preceding directory;
the current directory is remembered but is not offered as a destination\&.
Note that if you have multiple windows open 1 may refer to a directory
changed to in another window; you can avoid this by having per\-terminal
files for storing directory as described for the
\fBrecent\-dirs\-file\fP style below\&.
.PP
If you set the \fBrecent\-dirs\-default\fP style described below \fBcdr\fP
will behave the same as \fBcd\fP if given a non\-numeric argument, or more
than one argument\&.  The recent directory list is updated just the same
however you change directory\&.
.PP
If the argument is omitted, 1 is assumed\&.  This is similar to \fBpushd\fP\&'s
behaviour of swapping the two most recent directories on the stack\&.
.PP
Completion for the argument to \fBcdr\fP is available if compinit has been
run; menu selection is recommended, using:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:cdr:*:*' menu selection\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
to allow you to cycle through recent directories; the order is preserved,
so the first choice is the most recent directory before the current one\&.
The verbose style is also recommended to ensure the directory is shown; this
style is on by default so no action is required unless you have changed it\&.
.PP
.SS "Options"
.PP
The behaviour of \fBcdr\fP may be modified by the following options\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-l\fP
lists the numbers and the corresponding directories in
abbreviated form (i\&.e\&. with \fB~\fP substitution reapplied), one per line\&.
The directories here are not quoted (this would only be an issue if a
directory name contained a newline)\&.  This is used by the completion
system\&.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP
sets the variable \fBreply\fP to the current set of directories\&.  Nothing
is printed and the directory is not changed\&.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP
allows you to edit the list of directories, one per line\&.  The
list can be edited to any extent you like; no sanity checking is
performed\&.  Completion is available\&.  No quoting is necessary (except for
newlines, where I have in any case no sympathy); directories are in
unabbreviated from and contain an absolute path, i\&.e\&. they start with \fB/\fP\&.
Usually the first entry should be left as the current directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Configuration"
.PP
Configuration is by means of the styles mechanism that should be familiar
from completion; if not, see the description of the \fBzstyle\fP command in
see \fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  The context for setting styles
should be \fB\&':chpwd:*'\fP in case the meaning of the context is extended in
future, for example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':chpwd:*' recent\-dirs\-max 0\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
sets the value of the \fBrecent\-dirs\-max\fP style to 0\&.  In practice the
style name is specific enough that a context of \&'*' should be fine\&.
.PP
An exception is \fBrecent\-dirs\-insert\fP, which is used exclusively by the
completion system and so has the usual completion system context
(\fB\&':completion:*'\fP if nothing more specific is needed), though again
\fB\&'*'\fP should be fine in practice\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBrecent\-dirs\-default\fP
If true, and the command is expecting a recent directory index, and
either there is more than one argument or the argument is not an
integer, then fall through to "cd"\&.  This allows the lazy to use only
one command for directory changing\&.  Completion recognises this, too;
see recent\-dirs\-insert for how to control completion when this option
is in use\&.
.TP
\fBrecent\-dirs\-file\fP
The file where the list of directories is saved\&.  The default
is \fB${ZDOTDIR:\-$HOME}/\&.chpwd\-recent\-dirs\fP, i\&.e\&. this is in your
home directory unless you have set the variable \fBZDOTDIR\fP to point
somewhere else\&.  Directory names are saved in \fB$\&'\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB'\fP quoted
form, so each line in the file can be supplied directly to the shell as an
argument\&.
.RS
.PP
The value of this style may be an array\&.  In this case, the first
file in the list will always be used for saving directories while any
other files are left untouched\&.  When reading the recent directory
list, if there are fewer than the maximum number of entries in the
first file, the contents of later files in the array will be appended
with duplicates removed from the list shown\&.  The contents of the two
files are not sorted together, i\&.e\&. all the entries in the first file
are shown first\&.  The special value \fB+\fP can appear in the list to
indicate the default file should be read at that point\&.  This allows
effects like the following:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':chpwd:*' recent\-dirs\-file \e 
~/\&.chpwd\-recent\-dirs\-${TTY##*/} +\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Recent directories are read from a file numbered according to
the terminal\&.  If there are insufficient entries the list
is supplemented from the default file\&.
.PP
It is possible to use \fBzstyle \-e\fP to make the directory configurable
at run time:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \-e \&':chpwd:*' recent\-dirs\-file pick\-recent\-dirs\-file
pick\-recent\-dirs\-file() {
  if [[ $PWD = ~/text/writing(|/*) ]]; then

  else
    reply=(+)
  fi
}\fP

directory under it, then use a special file for saving recent
directories, else use the default\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBrecent\-dirs\-insert\fP
Used by completion\&.  If \fBrecent\-dirs\-default\fP is true, then setting
this to \fBtrue\fP causes the actual directory, rather than its index, to
be inserted on the command line; this has the same effect as using
the corresponding index, but makes the history clearer and the line
easier to edit\&.  With this setting, if part of an argument was
already typed, normal directory completion rather than recent
directory completion is done; this is because recent directory
completion is expected to be done by cycling through entries menu
fashion\&.
.RS
.PP
If the value of the style is \fBalways\fP, then only recent directories will
be completed; in that case, use the \fBcd\fP command when you want to
complete other directories\&.
.PP
If the value is \fBfallback\fP, recent directories will be tried first, then
normal directory completion is performed if recent directory completion
failed to find a match\&.
.PP
Finally, if the value is \fBboth\fP then both sets of completions are
presented; the usual tag mechanism can be used to distinguish results, with
recent directories tagged as \fBrecent\-dirs\fP\&.  Note that the recent
directories inserted are abbreviated with directory names where appropriate\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBrecent\-dirs\-max\fP
The maximum number of directories to save to the file\&.  If
this is zero or negative there is no maximum\&.  The default is 20\&.
Note this includes the current directory, which isn\&'t offered,
so the highest number of directories you will be offered
is one less than the maximum\&.
.TP
\fBrecent\-dirs\-prune\fP
This style is an array determining what directories should (or should
not) be added to the recent list\&.  Elements of the array can include:
.RS
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBparent\fP
Prune parents (more accurately, ancestors) from the recent list\&.
If present, changing directly down by any number of directories
causes the current directory to be overwritten\&.  For example,
changing from ~pws to ~pws/some/other/dir causes ~pws not to be
left on the recent directory stack\&.  This only applies to direct
changes to descendant directories; earlier directories on the
list are not pruned\&.  For example, changing from ~pws/yet/another
to ~pws/some/other/dir does not cause ~pws to be pruned\&.
.TP
\fBpattern:\fIpattern\fP\fP
Gives a zsh pattern for directories that should not be
added to the recent list (if not already there)\&.  This element
can be repeated to add different patterns\&.  For example,
\fB\&'pattern:/tmp(|/*)'\fP stops \fB/tmp\fP or its descendants
from being added\&.  The \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP option is always turned on
for these patterns\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBrecent\-dirs\-pushd\fP
If set to true, \fBcdr\fP will use \fBpushd\fP instead of \fBcd\fP to change the
directory, so the directory is saved on the directory stack\&.  As the
directory stack is completely separate from the list of files saved
by the mechanism used in this file there is no obvious reason to do
this\&.
.PP
.SS "Use with dynamic directory naming"

add\-zsh\-hook \-Uz zsh_directory_name zsh_directory_name_cdr\fP
.fi
.RE

directory other than $PWD, and so on\&.  Completion after \fB~[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP
also works\&.
.PP
.SS "Details of directory handling"
.PP
This section is for the curious or confused; most users will not
need to know this information\&.
.PP
Recent directories are saved to a file immediately and hence are
preserved across sessions\&.  Note currently no file locking is applied:
the list is updated immediately on interactive commands and nowhere else
(unlike history), and it is assumed you are only going to change
directory in one window at once\&.  This is not safe on shared accounts,
but in any case the system has limited utility when someone else is
changing to a different set of directories behind your back\&.
.PP
To make this a little safer, only directory changes instituted from the
command line, either directly or indirectly through shell function calls
(but not through subshells, evals, traps, completion functions and the
like) are saved\&.  Shell functions should use \fBcd \-q\fP or \fBpushd \-q\fP to
avoid side effects if the change to the directory is to be invisible at the
command line\&.  See the contents of the function \fBchpwd_recent_dirs\fP for
more details\&.

.SH "GATHERING INFORMATION FROM VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS"

In a lot of cases, it is nice to automatically retrieve information from

Obviously, the last two lines are there for demonstration\&. You need to
call \fBvcs_info\fP from your \fBprecmd\fP function\&. Once that is done you need
a \fBsingle quoted\fP \fB\&'${vcs_info_msg_0_}'\fP in your prompt\&.

this, you will need to have the \fBPROMPT_SUBST\fP option enabled\&.

You may not want all of these because there is no point in running the

If you rerun \fBvcs_info_printsys\fP after one of these commands, you will
see the backends listed in the \fBdisable\fP style (or backends not in the

\fIuser\-context\fP
is a freely configurable string, assignable by
the user as the first argument to \fBvcs_info\fP (see its description

.TP
\fIrepo\-root\-name\fP
is the name of a repository in which you want a

backend to use\&. The second is \fB\-preinit\-\fP; it is used \fIbefore\fP
\fBvcs_info\fP is run, when initializing the data exporting variables\&. The
third special value is \fBformats\fP and is used by the \fBvcs_info_lastmsg\fP

\fBformats\fP
A list of formats, used when actionformats is not used

.TP
\fBactionformats\fP
A list of formats, used if there is a special
action going on in your current repository; like an interactive rebase or
a merge conflict\&.
.TP
\fBbranchformat\fP
Some backends replace \fB%b\fP in the formats and
actionformats styles above, not only by a branch name but also by a
revision number\&. This style lets you modify how that string should look\&.
.TP
\fBnvcsformats\fP
These "formats" are exported when we didn\&'t detect a version control system
for the current directory or \fBvcs_info\fP was disabled\&. This is useful if
you want \fBvcs_info\fP to completely take over the generation of your
prompt\&. You would do something like \fBPS1=\&'${vcs_info_msg_0_}'\fP to
accomplish that\&.
.TP
\fBhgrevformat\fP
\fBhg\fP uses both a hash and a revision number to reference a specific
changeset in a repository\&. With this style you can format the revision
string (see \fBbranchformat\fP) to include either or both\&. It\&'s only
useful when \fBget\-revision\fP is true\&. Note, the full 40\-character revision id
is not available (except when using the \fBuse\-simple\fP option) because
executing hg more than once per prompt is too slow; you may customize this
behavior using hooks\&.
.TP
\fBmax\-exports\fP
Defines the maximum number of
\fBvcs_info_msg_*_\fP variables \fBvcs_info\fP will export\&.
.TP
\fBenable\fP
A list of backends you want to use\&. Checked in the \fB\-init\-\fP context\&. If
this list contains an item called \fBNONE\fP no backend is used at all and
\fBvcs_info\fP will do nothing\&. If this list contains \fBALL\fP, \fBvcs_info\fP
will use all known backends\&. Only with \fBALL\fP in \fBenable\fP will the
\fBdisable\fP style have any effect\&. \fBALL\fP and \fBNONE\fP are case insensitive\&.
.TP
\fBdisable\fP
A list of VCSs you don\&'t want \fBvcs_info\fP to test for

is used as the command name\&.
.TP
\fBcheck\-for\-changes\fP
If enabled, this style causes the \fB%c\fP and \fB%u\fP format escapes to show
when the working directory has uncommitted changes\&. The strings displayed by
these escapes can be controlled via the \fBstagedstr\fP and \fBunstagedstr\fP
styles\&. The only backends that currently support this option are \fBgit\fP and
\fBhg\fP (\fBhg\fP only supports unstaged)\&.
.RS
.PP
For this style to be evaluated with the \fBhg\fP backend, the \fBget\-revision\fP
style needs to be set and the \fBuse\-simple\fP style needs to be unset\&. The
latter is the default; the former is not\&.
.PP
Note, the actions taken if this style is enabled are potentially expensive
(read: they may be slow, depending on how big the current repository is)\&.
Therefore, it is disabled by default\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBstagedstr\fP
This string will be used in the \fB%c\fP escape if there are staged changes in
the repository\&.
.TP
\fBunstagedstr\fP
This string will be used in the \fB%u\fP escape if there are unstaged changes
in the repository\&.
.TP
\fBcommand\fP
This style causes \fBvcs_info\fP to use the supplied string as the command
to use as the VCS\&'s binary\&. Note, that setting this in ':vcs_info:*' is
not a good idea\&.
.RS
.PP
If the value of this style is empty (which is the default), the used binary
name is the name of the backend in use (e\&.g\&. \fBsvn\fP is used in an \fBsvn\fP
repository)\&.
.PP
The \fBrepo\-root\-name\fP part in the context is always the default \fB\-all\-\fP

For example, this style can be used to use binaries from non\-default
installation directories\&. Assume, \fBgit\fP is installed in /usr/bin but
your sysadmin installed a newer version in /usr/bin/local\&. Instead of
changing the order of your \fB$PATH\fP parameter, you can do this:

\fBuse\-server\fP
This is used by the Perforce backend (\fBp4\fP) to decide if it should
contact the Perforce server to find out if a directory is managed
by Perforce\&.  This is the only reliable way of doing this, but runs
the risk of a delay if the server name cannot be found\&.  If the
server (more specifically, the \fBhost\fP\fB:\fP\fBport\fP pair describing the
server) cannot be contacted, its name is put into the associative array
\fBvcs_info_p4_dead_servers\fP and is not contacted again during the session
until it is removed by hand\&.  If you do not set this style, the \fBp4\fP
backend is only usable if you have set the environment variable
\fBP4CONFIG\fP to a file name and have corresponding files in the root
directories of each Perforce client\&.  See comments in the function
\fBVCS_INFO_detect_p4\fP for more detail\&.
.TP
\fBuse\-simple\fP
If there are two different ways of gathering
information, you can select the simpler one by setting this style to true;
the default is to use the not\-that\-simple code, which is potentially a lot
slower but might be more accurate in all possible cases\&. This style is
used by the \fBbzr\fP and \fBhg\fP backends\&. In the case of \fBhg\fP it will invoke
the external hexdump program to parse the binary dirstate cache file; this
method will not return the local revision number\&.
.TP
\fBget\-revision\fP
If set to true, vcs_info goes the extra mile to figure out the revision of
a repository\&'s work tree (currently for the \fBgit\fP and \fBhg\fP backends,
where this kind of information is not always vital)\&. For \fBgit\fP, the
hash value of the currently checked out commit is available via the \fB%i\fP
expansion\&. With \fBhg\fP, the local revision number and the corresponding
global hash are available via \fB%i\fP\&.
.TP
\fBget\-mq\fP
If set to true, the \fBhg\fP backend will look for a Mercurial Queue (\fBmq\fP)
patch directory\&. Information will be available via the `\fB%m\fP\&' replacement\&.

mechanism can handle it\&. Similarly, to hand down \fB%b\fP from
\fBbranchformat\fP, use \fB%%%%b\fP\&. Sorry for this inconvenience, but it
cannot be easily avoided\&. Luckily we do not clash with a lot of prompt
expansions and this only needs to be done for those\&.
.PP
.SS "Quilt Support"
.PP
\fBQuilt\fP is not a version control system, therefore this is not implemented
as a backend\&. It can help keeping track of a series of patches\&. People use it
to keep a set of changes they want to use on top of software packages (which
is tightly integrated into the package build process \- the Debian project
does this for a large number of packages)\&. Quilt can also help individual
developers keep track of their own patches on top of real version control
systems\&.
.PP
The \fBvcs_info\fP integration tries to support both ways of using quilt by
having two slightly different modes of operation: `addon\&' mode and
`standalone\&' mode)\&.
.PP
For `addon\&' mode to become active \fBvcs_info\fP must have already detected a
real version control system controlling the directory\&. If that is the case,
a directory that holds quilt\&'s patches needs to be found\&. That directory is
configurable via the `\fBQUILT_PATCHES\fP\&' environment variable\&. If that
variable exists its value is used, otherwise the value `\fBpatches\fP\&' is
assumed\&. The value from \fB$QUILT_PATCHES\fP can be overwritten using the
\fB`quilt\-patches\&'\fP style\&. (Note: you can use \fBvcs_info\fP to keep the value
of \fB$QUILT_PATCHES\fP correct all the time via the \fBpost\-quilt\fP hook)\&.
.PP
When the directory in question is found, quilt is assumed to be active\&. To
gather more information, \fBvcs_info\fP looks for a directory called `\&.pc\&';
Quilt uses that directory to track its current state\&. If this directory does
not exist we know that quilt has not done anything to the working directory
(read: no patches have been applied yet)\&.
.PP
If patches are applied, \fBvcs_info\fP will try to find out which\&. If you want
to know which patches of a series are not yet applied, you need to activate
the \fBget\-unapplied\fP style in the appropriate context\&.
.PP
\fBvcs_info\fP allows for very detailed control over how the gathered
information is presented (see the below sections, \fBStyles\fP and \fBHooks in
vcs_info\fP), all of which are documented below\&. Note there are a number of
other patch tracking systems that work on top of a certain version control
system (like \fBstgit\fP for \fBgit\fP, or \fBmq\fP for \fBhg\fP); the configuration
for systems like that are generally configured the same way as the \fBquilt\fP
support\&.
.PP
If the \fBquilt\fP support is working in `addon\&' mode, the produced string is
available as a simple format replacement (\fB%Q\fP to be precise), which can
be used in \fBformats\fP and \fBactionformats\fP; see below for details)\&.
.PP
If, on the other hand, the support code is working in `standalone\&' mode,
\fBvcs_info\fP will pretend as if \fBquilt\fP were an actual version control
system\&. That means that the version control system identifier (which
otherwise would be something like `svn\&' or `cvs') will be set to
`\fB\-quilt\-\fP\&'\&. This has implications on the used style context where this
identifier is the second element\&. \fBvcs_info\fP will have filled in a proper
value for the "repository\&'s" root directory and the string containing the
information about quilt\&'s state will be available as the `misc' replacement
(and \fB%Q\fP for compatibility with `addon\&' mode\&.
.PP
What is left to discuss is how `standalone\&' mode is detected\&. The detection
itself is a series of searches for directories\&. You can have this detection
enabled all the time in every directory that is not otherwise under version
control\&. If you know there is only a limited set of trees where you would
like \fBvcs_info\fP to try and look for Quilt in `standalone\&' mode to minimise
the amount of searching on every call to \fBvcs_info\fP, there are a number of
ways to do that:
.PP
Essentially, `standalone\&' mode detection is controlled by a style called
`\fBquilt\-standalone\fP\&'\&. It is a string style and its value can have different
effects\&. The simplest values are: `\fBalways\fP\&' to run detection every time
\fBvcs_info\fP is run, and `\fBnever\fP\&' to turn the detection off entirely\&.
.PP
If the value of \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is something else, it is interpreted
differently\&. If the value is the name of a scalar variable the value of that
variable is checked and that value is used in the same `always\&'/`never' way
as described above\&.
.PP
If the value of \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is an array, the elements of that array
are used as directory names under which you want the detection to be active\&.
.PP
If \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is an associative array, the keys are taken as
directory names under which you want the detection to be active, but only if
the corresponding value is the string `\fBtrue\fP\&'\&.
.PP
Last, but not least, if the value of \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is the name of a
function, the function is called without arguments and the return value
decides whether detection should be active\&. A `0\&' return value is true; a
non\-zero return value is interpreted as false\&.
.PP
Note, if there is both a function and a variable by the name of
\fBquilt\-standalone\fP, the function will take precedence\&.

.SS "Hooks in vcs_info"
.PP
Hooks are places in \fBvcs_info\fP where you can run your own code\&. That
code can communicate with the code that called it and through that,
change the system\&'s behaviour\&.
.PP
For configuration, hooks change the style context:
.RS
.nf
\fB:vcs_info:\fIvcs\-string\fP+\fIhook\-name\fP:\fIuser\-context\fP:\fIrepo\-root\-name\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
To register functions to a hook, you need to list them in the \fBhooks\fP
style in the appropriate context\&.
.PP
Example:
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:*+foo:*' hooks bar baz\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This registers functions to the hook `foo\&' for all backends\&. In order to
avoid namespace problems, all registered function names are prepended by
a `+vi\-\&', so the actual functions called for the `foo' hook are
`\fB+vi\-bar\fP\&' and `\fB+vi\-baz\fP'\&.
.PP
If you would like to register a function to a hook regardless of the
current context, you may use the \fBvcs_info_hookadd\fP function\&. To remove
a function that was added like that, the \fBvcs_info_hookdel\fP function
can be used\&.
.PP
If something seems weird, you can enable the `debug\&' boolean style in
the proper context and the hook\-calling code will print what it tried
to execute and whether the function in question existed\&.
.PP
When you register more than one function to a hook, all functions are
executed one after another until one function returns non\-zero or until
all functions have been called\&. Context\-sensitive hook functions are
executed \fBbefore\fP statically registered ones (the ones added by
\fBvcs_info_hookadd\fP)\&.
.PP
You may pass data between functions via an associative array, \fBuser_data\fP\&.
For example:
.RS
.nf
\fB
+vi\-git\-myfirsthook(){
    user_data[myval]=$myval
}
+vi\-git\-mysecondhook(){
    # do something with ${user_data[myval]}
}\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
There are a number of variables that are special in hook contexts:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBret\fP
The return value that the hooks system will return to the caller\&. The
default is an integer `zero\&'\&. If and how a changed \fBret\fP value changes
the execution of the caller depends on the specific hook\&. See the hook
documentation below for details\&.
.TP
\fBhook_com\fP
An associated array which is used for bidirectional communication from
the caller to hook functions\&. The used keys depend on the specific hook\&.
.TP
\fBcontext\fP
The active context of the hook\&. Functions that wish to change this
variable should make it local scope first\&.
.TP
\fBvcs\fP
The current VCS after it was detected\&. The same values as in the
enable/disable style are used\&. Available in all hooks except \fBstart\-up\fP\&.
.PP
Finally, the full list of currently available hooks:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBstart\-up\fP
Called after starting \fBvcs_info\fP but before the VCS in this directory is
determined\&. It can be used to deactivate \fBvcs_info\fP temporarily if
necessary\&. When \fBret\fP is set to \fB1\fP, \fBvcs_info\fP aborts and does
nothing; when set to \fB2\fP, \fBvcs_info\fP sets up everything as if no
version control were active and exits\&.
.TP
\fBpre\-get\-data\fP
Same as \fBstart\-up\fP but after the VCS was detected\&.
.TP
\fBgen\-hg\-bookmark\-string\fP
Called in the Mercurial backend when a bookmark string is generated; the
\fBget\-revision\fP and \fBget\-bookmarks\fP styles must be true\&.
.RS
.PP
This hook gets the names of the Mercurial bookmarks that
\fBvcs_info\fP collected from `hg\&'\&.

\fBgen\-applied\-string\fP
Called in the \fBgit\fP (with \fBstgit\fP), and \fBhg\fP (with \fBmq\fP) backends

\fBuse\-quilt\fP zstyle must be true for \fBquilt\fP (the \fBmq\fP and \fBstgit\fP
backends are active by default)\&.
.RS
.PP
This hook gets the names of all applied patches which \fBvcs_info\fP collected

top\-most patch and so forth\&.
.PP
When setting \fBret\fP to non\-zero, the string in
\fB${hook_com[applied\-string]}\fP will be used in the \fB%m\fP escape in
\fBformats\fP and \fBactionformats\fP; it will be available in the global

\fBpost\-quilt\fP
Called after the \fBquilt\fP support is done\&. The following information
is passed as arguments to the hook: 1\&. the quilt\-support mode (`addon\&' or
`standalone\&'); 2\&. the directory that contains the patch series; 3\&. the

.RS
.PP
The `\fBhook_com\fP\&' keys considered are `\fBbranch\fP' and `\fBrevision\fP'\&.

\fBset\-message\fP
Called each time before a `\fBvcs_info_msg_N_\fP\&' message is set\&.
It takes two arguments; the first being the `N\&' in the message
variable name, the second is the currently configured \fBformats\fP or
\fBactionformats\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
There are a number of `\fBhook_com\fP\&' keys, that are used here:
`\fBaction\fP\&', `\fBbranch\fP', `\fBbase\fP', `\fBbase\-name\fP', `\fBsubdir\fP',
`\fBstaged\fP\&', `\fBunstaged\fP', `\fBrevision\fP', `\fBmisc\fP', `\fBvcs\fP'
and one `\fBmiscN\fP\&' entry for each backend\-specific data field (\fBN\fP
starting at zero)\&. They are set to the values figured out so far by
\fBvcs_info\fP and any change will be used directly when the actual
replacement is done\&.
.PP
Since this hook is triggered multiple times (once for each configured
\fBformats\fP or \fBactionformats\fP), each of the `\fBhook_com\fP\&' keys mentioned
above (except for the \fBmiscN\fP entries) has an `\fB_orig\fP\&' counterpart,
so even if you changed a value to your liking you can still get the
original value in the next run\&. Changing the `\fB_orig\fP\&' values is
probably not a good idea\&.

Now as promised, some code that uses hooks:
say, you\&'d like to replace the string `svn' by `subversion' in

First, we will tell \fBvcs_info\fP to call a function when populating
the message variables with the gathered information:
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:*+set\-message:*' hooks svn2subversion\fP
.fi
.RE

Nothing happens\&. Which is reasonable, since we didn\&'t define the actual

`\fBdebug\fP\&' style:
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:*+*:*' debug true\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
That should give you an idea what is going on\&. Specifically, the function
that we are looking for is `\fB+vi\-svn2subversion\fP\&'\&. Note, the `\fB+vi\-\fP'

checking out the debugging output, disable it again:
.RS

.RE

Now, let\&'s define the function:
.RS

\fB
function +vi\-svn2subversion() {
    [[ ${hook_com[vcs_orig]} == svn ]] && hook_com[vcs]=subversion
}\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Simple enough\&. And it could have even been simpler, if only we had
registered our function in a less generic context\&. If we do it only in
the `\fBsvn\fP\&' backend's context, we don't need to test which the active
backend is:

And finally a little more elaborate example, that uses a hook to create
a customised bookmark string for the \fBhg\fP backend\&.

Again, we start off by registering a function:
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:hg+gen\-hg\-bookmark\-string:*' hooks hgbookmarks\fP

And then we define the `\fB+vi\-hgbookmarks\fP function:

    # Those bookmarks look always like this: "sh/*"
    # (because your initials are sh, for example)\&.
    # This makes the bookmarks string use only those
    # bookmarks\&. If there\&'s more than one, it
    # concatenates them using commas\&.
    local s i
    # The bookmarks returned by `hg\&' are available in

The eight `\fB\-match\fP\&' functions are drop\-in replacements for the
builtin widgets without the suffix\&.  By default they behave in a similar
way\&.  However, by the use of styles and the function \fBselect\-word\-style\fP,
the way words are matched can be altered\&.
.RS
.PP
The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
\fBselect\-word\-style\fP, which can either be called as a normal function with
the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user\-defined widget that will
prompt for the first character of the word style to be used\&.  The first
time it is invoked, the eight \fB\-match\fP functions will automatically
replace the builtin versions, so they do not need to be loaded explicitly\&.

is examined\&.

Restore the default settings; this is usually the same as `\fBnormal\fP\&'\&.
.PP
All but `\fBdefault\fP\&' can be input as an upper case character, which has
the same effect but with subword matching turned on\&.  In this case, words
with upper case characters are treated specially: each separate run of
upper case characters, or an upper case character followed by any number of
other characters, is considered a word\&.  The style \fBsubword\-range\fP
can supply an alternative character range to the default `\fB[:upper:]\fP\&';
the value of the style is treated as the contents of a `\fB[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB]\fP\&'
pattern (note that the outer brackets should not be supplied, only
those surrounding named ranges)\&.
.PP
More control can be obtained using the \fBzstyle\fP command, as described in
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  Each style is looked up in the
context \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP where \fIwidget\fP is the name of the
user\-defined widget, not the name of the function implementing it, so in
the case of the definitions supplied by \fBselect\-word\-style\fP the
appropriate contexts are \fB:zle:forward\-word\fP, and so on\&.  The function
\fBselect\-word\-style\fP itself always defines styles for the context
`\fB:zle:*\fP\&' which can be overridden by more specific (longer) patterns as
well as explicit contexts\&.

arguments such as `\fB()\fP\&' are also treated as words\&.
.TP
\fBwhitespace\fP
Words are whitespace\-delimited strings of characters\&.
.PP
The first three of those rules usually use \fB$WORDCHARS\fP, but the value
in the parameter can be overridden by the style \fBword\-chars\fP, which works
in exactly the same way as \fB$WORDCHARS\fP\&.  In addition, the style
\fBword\-class\fP uses character class syntax to group characters and takes
precedence over \fBword\-chars\fP if both are set\&.  The \fBword\-class\fP style
does not include the surrounding brackets of the character class; for
example, `\fB\-:[:alnum:]\fP\&' is a valid \fBword\-class\fP to include all
alphanumerics plus the characters `\fB\-\fP\&' and `\fB:\fP'\&.  Be careful
including `\fB]\fP\&', `\fB^\fP' and `\fB\-\fP' as these are special inside
character classes\&.
.PP
\fBword\-style\fP may also have `\fB\-subword\fP\&' appended to its value to
turn on subword matching, as described above\&.
.PP
The style \fBskip\-chars\fP is mostly useful for
\fBtranspose\-words\fP and similar functions\&.  If set, it gives a count of
characters starting at the cursor position which will not be considered
part of the word and are treated as space, regardless of what they actually
are\&.  For example, if
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':zle:transpose\-words' skip\-chars 1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
has been set, and \fBtranspose\-words\-match\fP is called with the cursor on
the \fIX\fP of \fBfoo\fP\fIX\fP\fBbar\fP, where \fIX\fP can be any character, then
the resulting expression is \fBbar\fP\fIX\fP\fBfoo\fP\&.
.PP
Finer grained control can be obtained by setting the style \fBword\-context\fP
to an array of pairs of entries\&.  Each pair of entries consists of a
\fIpattern\fP and a \fIsubcontext\fP\&.  The shell argument the cursor is on is
matched against each \fIpattern\fP in turn until one matches; if it does,
the context is extended by a colon and the corresponding \fIsubcontext\fP\&.
Note that the test is made against the original word on the line, with no
stripping of quotes\&.  Special handling is done between words: the current
context is examined and if it contains the string \fBback\fP, the word before
the cursor is considered, else the word after cursor is considered\&. Some
examples are given below\&.
.PP
The style \fBskip\-whitespace\-first\fP is only used with the
\fBforward\-word\fP widget\&.  If it is set to true, then \fBforward\-word\fP
skips any non\-word\-characters, followed by any non\-word\-characters:
this is similar to the behaviour of other word\-orientated widgets,
and also that used by other editors, however it differs from the
standard zsh behaviour\&.  When using \fBselect\-word\-style\fP the widget
is set in the context \fB:zle:*\fP to \fBtrue\fP if the word style is
\fBbash\fP and \fBfalse\fP otherwise\&.  It may be overridden by setting it in
the more specific context \fB:zle:forward\-word*\fP\&.
.PP
Here are some examples of use of the styles, actually taken from the
simplified interface in \fBselect\-word\-style\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':zle:*' word\-style standard
zstyle \&':zle:*' word\-chars ''\fP

the context\&.

.fi
.RE
.PP
This provides two different ways of using \fBtranspose\-words\fP depending on
whether the cursor is on whitespace between words or on a filename, here
any word containing a \fB/\fP\&.  On whitespace, complete arguments as defined
by standard shell rules will be transposed\&.  In a filename, only
alphanumerics will be transposed\&.  Elsewhere, words will be transposed
using the default style for \fB:zle:transpose\-words\fP\&.
.PP
The word matching and all the handling of \fBzstyle\fP settings is actually
implemented by the function \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP\&.  This can be used to
create new user\-defined widgets\&.  The calling function should set the local
parameter \fBcurcontext\fP to \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP, create the local
parameter \fBmatched_words\fP and call \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP with no
arguments\&.  On return, \fBmatched_words\fP will be set to an array with the
elements: (1) the start of the line (2) the word before the cursor (3) any
non\-word characters between that word and the cursor (4) any non\-word
character at the cursor position plus any remaining non\-word characters
before the next word, including all characters specified by the
\fBskip\-chars\fP style, (5) the word at or following the cursor (6) any
non\-word characters following that word (7) the remainder of the line\&.  Any
of the elements may be an empty string; the calling function should test
for this to decide whether it can perform its function\&.

\fBcopy\-earlier\-word\fP
This widget works like a combination of \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP and
\fBcopy\-prev\-shell\-word\fP\&.  Repeated invocations of the widget retrieve
earlier words on the relevant history line\&.  With a numeric argument
\fIN\fP, insert the \fIN\fPth word from the history line; \fIN\fP may be
negative to count from the end of the line\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP has been used to retrieve the last word on a
previous history line, repeated invocations will replace that word with
earlier words from the same line\&.
.PP
Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line currently being edited\&.

be called to retrieve words\&.  This widget must accept the same three
arguments as \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP\&.
.RE

\fBcycle\-completion\-positions\fP
After inserting an unambiguous string into the command line, the new
function based completion system may know about multiple places in
this string where characters are missing or differ from at least one
of the possible matches\&.  It will then place the cursor on the
position it considers to be the most interesting one, i\&.e\&. the one
where one can disambiguate between as many matches as possible with as 
little typing as possible\&.
.RS

This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved to the other interesting

reported by the completion system\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBdelete\-whole\-word\-match\fP
This is another function which works like the \fB\-match\fP functions
described immediately above, i\&.e\&. using styles to decide the word
boundaries\&.  However, it is not a replacement for any existing function\&.
.RS
.PP
The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the cursor\&.  There is no
numeric prefix handling; only the single word around the cursor is
considered\&.  If the widget contains the string \fBkill\fP, the removed text
will be placed in the cutbuffer for future yanking\&.  This can be obtained
by defining \fBkill\-whole\-word\-match\fP as follows:
.PP

\fBup\-line\-or\-beginning\-search\fP, \fBdown\-line\-or\-beginning\-search\fP
These widgets are similar to the builtin functions \fBup\-line\-or\-search\fP

down within the buffer, otherwise they search for a history line matching
the start of the current line\&.  In this case, however, they search for
a line which matches the current line up to the current cursor position, in
the manner of \fBhistory\-beginning\-search\-backward\fP and \fB\-forward\fP, rather

\fBhistory\-beginning\-search\-menu\fP
This function implements yet another form of history searching\&.  The
text before the cursor is used to select lines from the history,
as for \fBhistory\-beginning\-search\-backward\fP except that all matches are
shown in a numbered menu\&.  Typing the appropriate digits inserts the
full history line\&.  Note that leading zeroes must be typed (they are only
shown when necessary for removing ambiguity)\&.  The entire history is
searched; there is no distinction between forwards and backwards\&.
.RS
.PP
With a prefix argument, the search is not anchored to the start of
the line; the string typed by the use may appear anywhere in the line
in the history\&.
.PP
If the widget name contains `\fB\-end\fP\&' the cursor is moved to the end of
the line inserted\&.  If the widget name contains `\fB\-space\fP\&' any space
in the text typed is treated as a wildcard and can match anything (hence
a leading space is equivalent to giving a prefix argument)\&.  Both
forms can be combined, for example:
.PP

.RE
.RE

\fBhistory\-pattern\-search\fP
The function \fBhistory\-pattern\-search\fP implements widgets which prompt
for a pattern with which to search the history backwards or forwards\&.  The
pattern is in the usual zsh format, however the first character may be
\fB^\fP to anchor the search to the start of the line, and the last character
may be \fB$\fP to anchor the search to the end of the line\&.  If the
search was not anchored to the end of the line the cursor is positioned
just after the pattern found\&.

\fBincarg\fP
Typing the keystrokes for this widget with the cursor placed on or to the

\fBinsert\-composed\-char\fP
This function allows you to compose characters that don\&'t appear on the
keyboard to be inserted into the command line\&.  The command is followed by
two keys corresponding to ASCII characters (there is no prompt)\&.  For
accented characters, the two keys are a base character followed by a code
for the accent, while for other special characters the two characters
together form a mnemonic for the character to be inserted\&.  The
two\-character codes are a subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see for
example \fBhttp://www\&.faqs\&.org/rfcs/rfc1345\&.html\fP)\&.
.RS
.PP
The function may optionally be followed by up to two characters which
replace one or both of the characters read from the keyboard; if both
characters are supplied, no input is read\&.  For example,
\fBinsert\-composed\-char a:\fP can be used within a widget to insert an a with
umlaut into the command line\&.  This has the advantages over use of a
literal character that it is more portable\&.
.PP
For best results zsh should have been built with support for multibyte
characters (configured with \fB\-\-enable\-multibyte\fP); however, the function
works for the limited range of characters available in single\-byte
character sets such as ISO\-8859\-1\&.
.PP
The character is converted into the local representation and
inserted into the command line at the cursor position\&.
(The conversion is done within the shell, using whatever facilities
the C library provides\&.)  With a numeric argument, the character and its
code are previewed in the status line
.PP
The function may be run outside zle in which case it prints the character
(together with a newline) to standard output\&.  Input is still read from
keystrokes\&.
.PP
See \fBinsert\-unicode\-char\fP for an alternative way of inserting Unicode
characters using their hexadecimal character number\&.

\fBpredict\-on\fP
This set of functions implements predictive typing using history search\&.
After \fBpredict\-on\fP, typing characters causes the editor to look backward
in the history for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
far\&.  After \fBpredict\-off\fP, editing returns to normal for the line found\&.
In fact, you often don\&'t even need to use \fBpredict\-off\fP, because if the
line doesn\&'t match something in the history, adding a key performs
standard completion, and then inserts itself if no completions were found\&.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to confuse prediction;
see the \fBtoggle\fP style below\&.
.RS
.PP
With the function based completion system (which is needed for this), you
should be able to type \fBTAB\fP at almost any point to advance the cursor
to the next ``interesting\&'' character position (usually the end of the
current word, but sometimes somewhere in the middle of the word)\&.  And of
course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can accept with
return, without needing to move the cursor to the end first\&.

The first time \fBpredict\-on\fP is used, it creates several additional
widget functions:

\fBread\-from\-minibuffer\fP
This is most useful when called as a function from inside a widget, but will
work correctly as a widget in its own right\&.  It prompts for a value
below the current command line; a value may be input using all of the
standard zle operations (and not merely the restricted set available
when executing, for example, \fBexecute\-named\-cmd\fP)\&.  The value is then
returned to the calling function in the parameter \fB$REPLY\fP and the
editing buffer restored to its previous state\&.  If the read was aborted
by a keyboard break (typically \fB^G\fP), the function returns status 1
and \fB$REPLY\fP is not set\&.
.RS
.PP
If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise `\fB? \fP\&' is used\&.  If two arguments are supplied, they are the
prompt and the initial value of \fB$LBUFFER\fP, and if a third argument is
given it is the initial value of \fB$RBUFFER\fP\&.  This provides a default
value and starting cursor placement\&.  Upon return the entire buffer is the
value of \fB$REPLY\fP\&.
.PP
One option is available: `\fB\-k\fP \fInum\fP\&' specifies that \fInum\fP
characters are to be read instead of a whole line\&.  The line editor is not
invoked recursively in this case, so depending on the terminal settings
the input may not be visible, and only the input keys are placed in
\fB$REPLY\fP, not the entire buffer\&.  Note that unlike the \fBread\fP builtin
\fInum\fP must be given; there is no default\&.
.PP
The name is a slight misnomer, as in fact the shell\&'s own minibuffer is
not used\&.  Hence it is still possible to call \fBexecuted\-named\-cmd\fP and
similar functions while reading a value\&.

\fBreplace\-string\fP, \fBreplace\-pattern\fP
.TP
.PD
\fBreplace\-string\-again\fP, \fBreplace\-pattern\-again\fP
The function \fBreplace\-string\fP implements three widgets\&.
If defined under the same name as the function, it prompts for two
strings; the first (source) string will be replaced by the second
everywhere it occurs in the line editing buffer\&.
.RS
.PP
If the widget name contains the word `\fBpattern\fP\&', for example by
defining the widget using the command `\fBzle \-N replace\-pattern
replace\-string\fP\&', then the matching is performed using zsh patterns\&.  All
zsh extended globbing patterns can be used in the source string; note
that unlike filename generation the pattern does not need to match an
entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any effect\&.  In addition, the
replacement string can contain parameter or command substitutions\&.
Furthermore, a `\fB&\fP\&' in the replacement string will be replaced with
the matched source string, and a backquoted digit `\fB\e\fP\fIN\fP\&' will be
replaced by the \fIN\fPth parenthesised expression matched\&.  The form
`\fB\e{\fP\fIN\fP\fB}\fP\&' may be used to protect the digit from following
digits\&.
.PP
If the widget instead contains the word `\fBregex\fP\&' (or `\fBregexp\fP'),
then the matching is performed using regular expressions, respecting
the setting of the option \fBRE_MATCH_PCRE\fP (see the description of the
function \fBregexp\-replace\fP below)\&.  The special replacement facilities
described above for pattern matching are available\&.
.PP
By default the previous source or replacement string will not be offered
for editing\&.  However, this feature can be activated by setting the style
\fBedit\-previous\fP in the context \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP (for example,
\fB:zle:replace\-string\fP) to \fBtrue\fP\&.  In addition, a positive
numeric argument forces the previous values to be offered, a negative or
zero argument forces them not to be\&.
.PP
The function \fBreplace\-string\-again\fP can be used to repeat the previous
replacement; no prompting is done\&.  As with \fBreplace\-string\fP, if the name
of the widget contains the word `\fBpattern\fP\&' or `\fBregex\fP', pattern or
regular expression matching is performed, else a literal string
replacement\&.  Note that the previous source and replacement text are the
same whether pattern, regular expression or string matching is used\&.
.PP
In addition, \fBreplace\-string\fP shows the previous replacement above
the prompt, so long as there was one during the current session; if the
source string is empty, that replacement will be repeated without
the widget prompting for a replacement string\&.
.PP
For example, starting from the line:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint This line contains fan and fond\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
and invoking \fBreplace\-pattern\fP with the source string
`\fBf(?)n\fP\&' and
the replacement string `\fBc\e1r\fP\&' produces the not very useful line:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint This line contains car and cord\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The range of the replacement string can be limited by using the
\fBnarrow\-to\-region\-invisible\fP widget\&.  One limitation of the current
version is that \fBundo\fP will cycle through changes to the replacement
and source strings before undoing the replacement itself\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBsend\-invisible\fP
This is similar to read\-from\-minibuffer in that it may be called as a
function from a widget or as a widget of its own, and interactively reads
input from the keyboard\&.  However, the input being typed is concealed and
a string of asterisks (`\fB*\fP\&') is shown instead\&.  The value is saved in
the parameter \fB$INVISIBLE\fP to which a reference is inserted into the
editing buffer at the restored cursor position\&.  If the read was aborted
by a keyboard break (typically \fB^G\fP) or another escape from editing such
as \fBpush\-line\fP, \fB$INVISIBLE\fP is set to empty and the original buffer
is restored unchanged\&.
.RS
.PP
If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise `\fBNon\-echoed text: \fP\&' is used (as in emacs)\&.  If a second and
third argument are supplied they are used to begin and end the reference
to \fB$INVISIBLE\fP that is inserted into the buffer\&.  The default is to
open with \fB${\fP, then \fBINVISIBLE\fP, and close with \fB}\fP, but many
other effects are possible\&.

\fBsmart\-insert\-last\-word\fP

.RS
.nf
\fBzle \-N insert\-last\-word smart\-insert\-last\-word\fP

.RE
.PP
With a numeric prefix, or when passed command line arguments in a call
from another widget, it behaves like \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP, except that
words in comments are ignored when \fBINTERACTIVE_COMMENTS\fP is set\&.
.PP
Otherwise, the rightmost ``interesting\&'' word from the previous command is
found and inserted\&.  The default definition of ``interesting\&'' is that the
word contains at least one alphabetic character, slash, or backslash\&.
This definition may be overridden by use of the \fBmatch\fP style\&.  The
context used to look up the style is the widget name, so usually the
context is \fB:insert\-last\-word\fP\&.  However, you can bind this function to
different widgets to use different patterns:
.PP
.RS

.RE
.PP
If no interesting word is found and the \fBauto\-previous\fP style is set to

\fBauto\-previous\fP is unset or false (the default), the widget must be
invoked repeatedly in order to search earlier history lines\&.
.RE

\fBtranspose\-lines\fP
Only useful with a multi\-line editing buffer; the lines here are
lines within the current on\-screen buffer, not history lines\&.
The effect is similar to the function of the same name in Emacs\&.
.RS
.PP
Transpose the current line with the previous line and move the cursor
to the start of the next line\&.  Repeating this (which can be done by
providing a positive numeric prefix argument) has the effect of moving
the line above the cursor down by a number of lines\&.
.PP
With a negative numeric prefix argument, requires two lines above the
cursor\&.  These two lines are transposed and the cursor moved to the
start of the previous line\&.  Using a numeric prefix less than \-1
has the effect of moving the line above the cursor up by minus that
number of lines\&.

\fBwhich\-command\fP
This function is a drop\-in replacement for the builtin widget
\fBwhich\-command\fP\&.  It has enhanced behaviour, in that it correctly

alias until it reaches the command that will be executed\&.

\fBsplit\-shell\-arguments\fP
This function splits the line currently being edited into shell arguments

contains all the parts of the line in order, starting with any whitespace
before the first argument, and finishing with any whitespace after the last
argument\&.  Hence (so long as the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP is not set)
whitespace is given by odd indices in the array and arguments by
even indices\&.  Note that no stripping of quotes is done; joining together
all the elements of \fBreply\fP in order is guaranteed to produce the
original line\&.
.RS
.PP
The parameter \fBREPLY\fP is set to the index of the word in \fBreply\fP which
contains the character after the cursor, where the first element has index
1\&.  The parameter \fBREPLY2\fP is set to the index of the character under the
cursor in that word, where the first character has index 1\&.

\fBmodify\-current\-argument\fP \fIexpr\-using\-\fP\fB$ARG\fP

\fBcompleter\fP

\fBkey\fP
The cursor is left
after the \fIn\fPth occurrence of the character just inserted, where
\fIn\fP is the number of times that character appeared in the word

The function \fBthrow\fP throws the named \fIexception\fP\&.  The name is

\fBcatch\fP \fIexception\-pattern\fP
The function \fBcatch\fP returns status zero if an exception was thrown and
the pattern \fIexception\-pattern\fP matches its name\&.  Otherwise it
returns status 1\&.  \fIexception\-pattern\fP is a standard
shell pattern, respecting the current setting of the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP
option\&.  An alias \fBcatch\fP is also defined to prevent the argument to the
function from matching filenames, so patterns may be used unquoted\&.  Note
that as exceptions are not fundamentally different from other shell errors
it is possible to catch shell errors by using an empty string as the
exception name\&.  The shell variable \fBCAUGHT\fP is set by \fBcatch\fP to the
name of the exception caught\&.  It is possible to rethrow an exception by
calling the \fBthrow\fP function again once an exception has been caught\&.

In common with exception handling in other languages, the exception may be
thrown by code deeply nested inside the `try\&' block\&.  However, note that it
must be thrown inside the current shell, not in a subshell forked for a
pipeline, parenthesised current\-shell construct, or some form of
command or process substitution\&.
.PP
The system internally uses the shell variable \fBEXCEPTION\fP to record the
name of the exception between throwing and catching\&.  One drawback of this
scheme is that if the exception is not handled the variable \fBEXCEPTION\fP
remains set and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of an exception
if a shell error subsequently occurs\&.  Adding \fBunset EXCEPTION\fP at the
start of the outermost layer of any code that uses exception handling will
eliminate this problem\&.

For files that have multiple suffixes, e\&.g\&. \fB\&.pdf\&.gz\fP, where the
context includes the suffix it will be looked up starting with the
longest possible suffix until a match for the style is found\&.
For example, if \fB\&.pdf\&.gz\fP produces a match for the handler, that
will be used; otherwise the handler for \fB\&.gz\fP will be used\&.  Note
that, owing to the way suffix aliases work, it is always required that
there be a handler for the shortest possible suffix, so in this example
\fB\&.pdf\&.gz\fP can only be handled if \fB\&.gz\fP is also handled (though
not necessarily in the same way)\&.  Alternatively, if no handling
for \fB\&.gz\fP on its own is needed, simply adding the command

\fBcurrent\-shell\fP
If this boolean style is true, the mailcap handler for the context in
question is run using the \fBeval\fP builtin instead of by starting a new
\fBsh\fP process\&.  This is more efficient, but may not work in the occasional
cases where the mailcap handler uses strict POSIX syntax\&.
.TP
\fBexecute\-as\-is\fP
This style gives a list of patterns to be matched against files
passed for execution with a handler program\&.  If the file matches
the pattern, the entire command line is executed in its current form,
with no handler\&.  This is useful for files which might have suffixes
but nonetheless be executable in their own right\&.  If the style
is not set, the pattern \fB*(*) *(/)\fP is used;
hence executable files are executed directly and not passed to a
handler, and the option \fBAUTO_CD\fP may be used to change to directories
that happen to have MIME suffixes\&.
.TP
\fBfile\-path\fP
Used if the style \fBfind\-file\-in\-path\fP is true for the same context\&.
Set to an array of directories that are used for searching for the
file to be handled; the default is the command path given by the
special parameter \fBpath\fP\&.  The shell option \fBPATH_DIRS\fP is respected;
if that is set, the appropriate path will be searched even if the
name of the file to be handled as it appears on the command line contains
a `\fB/\fP\&'\&.
The full context is \fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, as described for the style
\fBhandler\fP\&.
.TP
\fBfind\-file\-in\-path\fP
If set, allows files whose names do not contain absolute paths
to be searched for in the command path or the path specified by the
\fBfile\-path\fP style\&.  If the file is not found in the path, it is looked
for locally (whether or not the current directory is in the path); if it is
not found locally, the handler will abort unless the \fBhandle\-nonexistent\fP
style is set\&.  Files found in the path are tested as described for
the style \fBexecute\-as\-is\fP\&.
The full context is \fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, as described for the style

.TP
\fBhandle\-nonexistent\fP
By default, arguments that don\&'t correspond to files are not passed
to the MIME handler in order to prevent it from intercepting commands found
in the path that happen to have suffixes\&.  This style may be set to
an array of extended glob patterns for arguments that will be passed to the
handler even if they don\&'t exist\&.  If it is not explicitly set it
defaults to \fB[[:alpha:]]#:/*\fP which allows URLs to be passed to the MIME
handler even though they don\&'t exist in that format in the file system\&.
The full context is \fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, as described for the style
\fBhandler\fP\&.
.TP
\fBhandler\fP
Specifies a handler for a suffix; the suffix is given by the context as
\fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, and the format of the handler is exactly
that in \fBmailcap\fP\&.  Note in particular the `\fB\&.\fP\&' and trailing colon
to distinguish this use of the context\&.  This overrides any handler
specified by the \fBmailcap\fP files\&.  If the handler requires a terminal,
the \fBflags\fP style should be set to include the word \fBneedsterminal\fP,
or if the output is to be displayed through a pager (but not if the
handler is itself a pager), it should include \fBcopiousoutput\fP\&.

.PP
The command `\fBalias \-s\fP \fIext\fP\&' should show
`\fBps=zsh\-mime\-handler\fP\&'\&.  If it shows something else, another suffix
alias was already installed and was not overwritten\&.  If it shows
nothing, no handler was installed:  this is most likely because no
handler was found in the \fB\&.mime\&.types\fP and \fBmailcap\fP combination for
\fB\&.ext\fP files\&.  In that case, appropriate handling should be added to
\fB~/\&.mime\&.types\fP and \fBmailcap\fP\&.
.PP
If the extension is handled by \fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP but the file is
not opened correctly, either the handler defined for the type is
incorrect, or the flags associated with it are in appropriate\&.  Running
\fBzsh\-mime\-setup \-l\fP will show the handler and, if there are any, the
flags\&.  A \fB%s\fP in the handler is replaced by the file (suitably quoted

be run in the way shown\&.  Also check that the flags \fBneedsterminal\fP or
\fBcopiousoutput\fP are set if the handler needs to be run under a
terminal; the second flag is used if the output should be sent to a pager\&.

\fBrun\-help\fP \fIcmd\fP
This function is designed to be invoked by the \fBrun\-help\fP ZLE widget,
in place of the default alias\&.  See `Accessing On\-Line Help\&'
above for setup instructions\&.
.RS
.PP
In the discussion which follows, if \fIcmd\fP is a file system path, it is
first reduced to its rightmost component (the file name)\&.
.PP
Help is first sought by looking for a file named \fIcmd\fP in the directory
named by the \fBHELPDIR\fP parameter\&.  If no file is found, an assistant
function, alias, or command named \fBrun\-help\-\fIcmd\fP\fP is sought\&.  If
found, the assistant is executed with the rest of the current command line
(everything after the command name \fIcmd\fP) as its arguments\&.  When
neither file nor assistant is found, the external command
`\fBman\fP \fIcmd\fP\&' is run\&.

This function has a similar purpose to GNU xargs\&.  Instead of
reading lines of arguments from the standard input, it takes them from
the command line\&.  This is useful because zsh, especially with recursive
glob operators, often can construct a command line for a shell function
that is longer than can be accepted by an external command\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fIoption\fP list represents options of the \fBzargs\fP command itself,
which are the same as those of \fBxargs\fP\&.  The \fIinput\fP list is the
collection of strings (often file names) that become the arguments of the
\fBcommand\fP, analogous to the standard input of \fBxargs\fP\&.  Finally, the
\fIarg\fP list consists of those arguments (usually options) that are
passed to the \fIcommand\fP each time it runs\&.  The \fIarg\fP list precedes
the elements from the \fBinput\fP list in each run\&.  If no \fIcommand\fP is
provided, then no \fIarg\fP list may be provided, and in that event the
default command is `\fBprint\fP\&' with arguments `\fB\-r \-\fP\fB\-\fP'\&.
.PP
For example, to get a long \fBls\fP listing of all plain files in the
current directory or its subdirectories:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBautoload \-U zargs
zargs \-\- **/*(\&.) \-\- ls \-l\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' is used both to mark the end of the \fIoption\fP
list and to mark the end of the \fIinput\fP list, so it must appear twice
whenever the \fIinput\fP list may be empty\&.  If there is guaranteed to be
at least one \fIinput\fP and the first \fIinput\fP does not begin with a
`\fB\-\fP\&', then the first `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP' may be omitted\&.
.PP
In the event that the string `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' is or may be an \fIinput\fP, the
\fB\-e\fP option may be used to change the end\-of\-inputs marker\&.  Note that
this does \fInot\fP change the end\-of\-options marker\&.  For example, to use
`\fB\&.\&.\fP\&' as the marker:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzargs \-e\&.\&. \-\- **/*(\&.) \&.\&. ls \-l\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This is a good choice in that example because no plain file can be named
`\fB\&.\&.\fP\&', but the best end\-marker depends on the circumstances\&.
.PP
The options \fB\-i\fP, \fB\-I\fP, \fB\-l\fP, \fB\-L\fP, and \fB\-n\fP differ slightly
from their usage in \fBxargs\fP\&.  There are no input lines for \fBzargs\fP to
count, so \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-L\fP count through the \fIinput\fP list, and \fB\-n\fP
counts the number of arguments passed to each execution of \fIcommand\fP,
\fIincluding\fP any \fIarg\fP list\&.  Also, any time \fB\-i\fP or \fB\-I\fP is used,
each \fIinput\fP is processed separately as if by `\fB\-L\fP \fB1\fP\&'\&.
.PP
For details of the other \fBzargs\fP options, see \fIxargs\fP(1) (but note
the difference in function between \fBzargs\fP and \fBxargs\fP) or run
\fBzargs\fP with the \fB\-\fP\fB\-help\fP option\&.

\fBzed \-b\fP
This function uses the ZLE editor to edit a file or function\&.
.RS
.PP
Only one \fIname\fP argument is allowed\&.
If the \fB\-f\fP option is given, the name is taken to be that of
a function; if the function is marked for autoloading, \fBzed\fP searches
for it in the \fBfpath\fP and loads it\&.  Note that functions edited this way
are installed into the current shell, but \fInot\fP written back to the
autoload file\&.
.PP
Without \fB\-f\fP, \fIname\fP is the path name of the file to edit, which need
not exist; it is created on write, if necessary\&.
.PP
While editing, the function sets the main keymap to \fBzed\fP and the
vi command keymap to \fBzed\-vicmd\fP\&.  These will be copied from the existing
\fBmain\fP and \fBvicmd\fP keymaps if they do not exist the first time \fBzed\fP
is run\&.  They can be used to provide special key bindings used only in zed\&.
.PP
If it creates the keymap, \fBzed\fP rebinds the return key to insert a line
break and `\fB^X^W\fP\&' to accept the edit in the \fBzed\fP keymap, and binds
`\fBZZ\fP\&' to accept the edit in the \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymap\&.
.PP
The bindings alone can be installed by running `\fBzed \-b\fP\&'\&.  This is
suitable for putting into a startup file\&.  Note that, if rerun,
this will overwrite the existing \fBzed\fP and \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymaps\&.
.PP
Completion is available, and styles may be set with the context prefix
`\fB:completion:zed\fP\&'\&.
.PP
A zle widget \fBzed\-set\-file\-name\fP is available\&.  This can be called by
name from within zed using `\fB\eex zed\-set\-file\-name\fP\&' (note, however, that
because of zed\&'s rebindings you will have to type \fB^j\fP at the end instead
of the return key), or can be bound to a key in either of the \fBzed\fP or
\fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymaps after `\fBzed \-b\fP\&' has been run\&.  When the widget is
called, it prompts for a new name for the file being edited\&.  When zed
exits the file will be written under that name and the original file will
be left alone\&.  The widget has no effect with `\fBzed \-f\fP\&'\&.
.PP
While \fBzed\-set\-file\-name\fP is running, zed uses the keymap
\fBzed\-normal\-keymap\fP, which is linked from the main keymap in effect
at the time zed initialised its bindings\&.  (This is to make the return key
operate normally\&.)  The result is that if the main keymap has been changed,
the widget won\&'t notice\&.  This is not a concern for most users\&.

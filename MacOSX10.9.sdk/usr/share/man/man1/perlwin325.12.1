.SH "NAME"
perlwin32 \- Perl under Windows
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
These are instructions for building Perl under Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP
on the Intel x86 and Itanium architectures.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Before you start, you should glance through the \s-1README\s0 file
found in the top-level directory to which the Perl distribution
was extracted.  Make sure you read and understand the terms under
which this software is being distributed.
.PP
Also make sure you read \*(L"\s-1BUGS\s0 \s-1AND\s0 \s-1CAVEATS\s0\*(R" below for the
known limitations of this port.
.PP
The \s-1INSTALL\s0 file in the perl top-level has much information that is
only relevant to people building Perl on Unix-like systems.  In
particular, you can safely ignore any information that talks about
\&\*(L"Configure\*(R".
.PP
You may also want to look at two other options for building
a perl that will work on Windows \s-1NT:\s0  the \s-1README\s0.cygwin and
\&\s-1README\s0.os2 files, each of which give a different set of rules to
build a Perl that will work on Win32 platforms.  Those two methods
will probably enable you to build a more Unix-compatible perl, but
you will also need to download and use various other build-time and
run-time support software described in those files.
.PP
This set of instructions is meant to describe a so-called \*(L"native\*(R"
port of Perl to Win32 platforms.  This includes both 32\-bit and
64\-bit Windows operating systems.  The resulting Perl requires no
additional software to run (other than what came with your operating
system).  Currently, this port is capable of using one of the
following compilers on the Intel x86 architecture:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&      Borland C++           version 5.02 or later
\&      Microsoft Visual C++  version 2.0 or later
\&      MinGW with gcc        gcc version 2.95.2 or later
\&      Gcc by mingw.org        gcc version 2.95.2 or later
\&      Gcc by mingw\-w64.sf.net gcc version 4.4.3 or later
.Ve
.PP
Note that the last two of these are actually competing projects both
delivering complete gcc toolchain for \s-1MS\s0 Windows:
\&\- http://mingw.org \- delivers gcc toolchain targeting 32\-bit Windows
  platform.
  Use version 3.2.x or later for the best results with this compiler.
\&\- http://mingw\-w64.sf.net \- delivers gcc toolchain targeting both 64\-bit
  Windows and 32\-bit Windows platforms (despite the project name \*(L"mingw\-w64\*(R"
  they are not only 64\-bit oriented). They deliver the native gcc compilers
  + cross-compilers that are also supported by perl's makefile.
.PP
The Borland \*(C+ and Microsoft Visual \*(C+ compilers are also now being given
away free.  The Borland compiler is available as \*(L"Borland \*(C+ Compiler Free
Command Line Tools\*(R" and is the same compiler that ships with the full
\&\*(L"Borland \*(C+ Builder\*(R" product.  The Microsoft compiler is available as
\&\*(L"Visual \*(C+ Toolkit 2003\*(R" or \*(L"Visual \*(C+ 2005/2008 Express Edition\*(R" (and also
as part of the \*(L".NET Framework \s-1SDK\s0\*(R") and is the same compiler that ships with
\&\*(L"Visual \*(C+ .NET 2003 Professional\*(R" or \*(L"Visual \*(C+ 2005/2008 Professional\*(R"
respectively.
.PP
This port can also be built on \s-1IA64/AMD64\s0 using:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&      Microsoft Platform SDK    Nov 2001 (64\-bit compiler and tools)
\&      MinGW64 compiler (gcc version 4.4.3 or later)
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1MS\s0 Platform \s-1SDK\s0 can be downloaded from http://www.microsoft.com/.
The MinGW64 compiler is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw\-w64.
The latter is actually a cross-compiler targeting Win64. There's also a trimmed
down compiler (no java, or gfortran) suitable for building perl available at:
http://strawberryperl.com/package/kmx/64_gcctoolchain/mingw64\-w64\-20100123\-kmx\-v2.zip
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 If you're using a 32\-bit compiler to build perl on a 64\-bit Windows
operating system, then you should set the \s-1WIN64\s0 environment variable to \*(L"undef\*(R".
Also, the trimmed down compiler only passes tests when \s-1USE_ITHREADS\s0 *= define
(as opposed to undef) and when the \s-1CFG\s0 *= Debug line is commented out.
.PP
This port fully supports MakeMaker (the set of modules that
is used to build extensions to perl).  Therefore, you should be
able to build and install most extensions found in the \s-1CPAN\s0 sites.
See \*(L"Usage Hints for Perl on Win32\*(R" below for general hints about this.
.SS "Setting Up Perl on Win32"
.IX Subsection "Setting Up Perl on Win32"
.IP "Make" 4
.IX Item "Make"
You need a \*(L"make\*(R" program to build the sources.  If you are using
Visual \*(C+ or the Platform \s-1SDK\s0 tools under Windows \s-1NT/2000/XP\s0, nmake
will work.  All other builds need dmake.
.Sp
dmake is a freely available make that has very nice macro features
and parallelability.
.Sp
A port of dmake for Windows is available from:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    http://search.cpan.org/dist/dmake/
.Ve
.Sp
Fetch and install dmake somewhere on your path.
.Sp
There exists a minor coexistence problem with dmake and Borland \*(C+
compilers.  Namely, if a distribution has C files named with mixed
case letters, they will be compiled into appropriate .obj\-files named
with all lowercase letters, and every time dmake is invoked
to bring files up to date, it will try to recompile such files again.
For example, Tk distribution has a lot of such files, resulting in
needless recompiles every time dmake is invoked.  To avoid this, you
may use the script \*(L"sync_ext.pl\*(R" after a successful build.  It is
available in the win32 subdirectory of the Perl source distribution.
.IP "Command Shell" 4
.IX Item "Command Shell"
Use the default \*(L"cmd\*(R" shell that comes with \s-1NT\s0.  Some versions of the
popular 4DOS/NT shell have incompatibilities that may cause you trouble.
If the build fails under that shell, try building again with the cmd
shell.
.Sp
The nmake Makefile also has known incompatibilities with the
\&\*(L"command.com\*(R" shell that comes with Windows 9x.  You will need to
use dmake and makefile.mk to build under Windows 9x.
.Sp
The surest way to build it is on Windows \s-1NT/2000/XP\s0, using the cmd shell.
.Sp
Make sure the path to the build directory does not contain spaces.  The
build usually works in this circumstance, but some tests will fail.
.IP "Borland \*(C+" 4
.IX Item "Borland "
If you are using the Borland compiler, you will need dmake.
(The make that Borland supplies is seriously crippled and will not
work for MakeMaker builds.)
.Sp
See \*(L"Make\*(R" above.
.IP "Microsoft Visual \*(C+" 4
.IX Item "Microsoft Visual "
The nmake that comes with Visual \*(C+ will suffice for building.
You will need to run the \s-1VCVARS32\s0.BAT file, usually found somewhere
like C:\eMSDEV4.2\eBIN or C:\eProgram Files\eMicrosoft Visual Studio\eVC98\eBin.
This will set your build environment.
.Sp
You can also use dmake to build using Visual \*(C+; provided, however,
you set \s-1OSRELEASE\s0 to \*(L"microsft\*(R" (or whatever the directory name
under which the Visual C dmake configuration lives) in your environment
and edit win32/config.vc to change \*(L"make=nmake\*(R" into \*(L"make=dmake\*(R".  The
latter step is only essential if you want to use dmake as your default
make for building extensions using MakeMaker.
.IP "Microsoft Visual \*(C+ 2008 Express Edition" 4
.IX Item "Microsoft Visual  2008 Express Edition"
This free version of Visual \*(C+ 2008 Professional contains the same compiler
and linker that ship with the full version, and also contains everything
necessary to build Perl, rather than requiring a separate download of the
Platform \s-1SDK\s0 like previous versions did.
.Sp
This package can be downloaded by searching for \*(L"Visual Studio 2008 Express
Edition\*(R" in the Download Center at
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en.  (Providing exact
links to these packages has proven a pointless task because the links keep on
changing so often.)
.Sp
Install Visual \*(C+ 2008, then setup your environment using

.IX Item "Microsoft Visual  2005 Express Edition"
This free version of Visual \*(C+ 2005 Professional contains the same compiler
and linker that ship with the full version, but doesn't contain everything
necessary to build Perl.
.Sp
You will also need to download the \*(L"Platform \s-1SDK\s0\*(R" (the \*(L"Core \s-1SDK\s0\*(R" and \*(L"\s-1MDAC\s0
\&\s-1SDK\s0\*(R" components are required) for more header files and libraries.
.Sp
These packages can both be downloaded by searching in the Download Center at
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en.  (Providing exact
links to these packages has proven a pointless task because the links keep on
changing so often.)
.Sp
Try to obtain the latest version of the Platform \s-1SDK\s0.  Sometimes these packages
contain a particular Windows \s-1OS\s0 version in their name, but actually work on
other \s-1OS\s0 versions too.  For example, the \*(L"Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform \s-1SDK\s0\*(R"
also runs on Windows \s-1XP\s0 \s-1SP2\s0 and Windows 2000.
.Sp
According to the download pages these packages are only supported on Windows
2000/XP/2003, so trying to use these tools on Windows 95/98/ME and even Windows
\&\s-1NT\s0 probably won't work.
.Sp
Install Visual \*(C+ 2005 first, then the Platform \s-1SDK\s0.  Setup your environment
as follows (assuming default installation locations were chosen):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SET PlatformSDKDir=C:\eProgram Files\eMicrosoft Platform SDK

.IP "Microsoft Visual \*(C+ Toolkit 2003" 4
.IX Item "Microsoft Visual  Toolkit 2003"
This free toolkit contains the same compiler and linker that ship with
Visual \*(C+ .NET 2003 Professional, but doesn't contain everything
necessary to build Perl.
.Sp
You will also need to download the \*(L"Platform \s-1SDK\s0\*(R" (the \*(L"Core \s-1SDK\s0\*(R" and \*(L"\s-1MDAC\s0
\&\s-1SDK\s0\*(R" components are required) for header files, libraries and rc.exe, and
\&\*(L".NET Framework \s-1SDK\s0\*(R" for more libraries and nmake.exe.  Note that the latter
(which also includes the free compiler and linker) requires the \*(L".NET
Framework Redistributable\*(R" to be installed first.  This can be downloaded and
installed separately, but is included in the \*(L"Visual \*(C+ Toolkit 2003\*(R" anyway.
.Sp
These packages can all be downloaded by searching in the Download Center at
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en.  (Providing exact

Try to obtain the latest version of the Platform \s-1SDK\s0.  Sometimes these packages
contain a particular Windows \s-1OS\s0 version in their name, but actually work on
other \s-1OS\s0 versions too.  For example, the \*(L"Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform \s-1SDK\s0\*(R"

.Sp
Install the Toolkit first, then the Platform \s-1SDK\s0, then the .NET Framework \s-1SDK\s0.
Setup your environment as follows (assuming default installation locations
were chosen):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SET PlatformSDKDir=C:\eProgram Files\eMicrosoft Platform SDK

.RS 4

cvtres.exe is required by link.exe when using a .res file.  It is actually
installed by the .NET Framework \s-1SDK\s0, but into a location such as the
following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        C:\eWINDOWS\eMicrosoft.NET\eFramework\ev1.1.4322
.Ve
.Sp
Copy it from there to \f(CW%PlatformSDKDir\fR%\eBin
.IP "\(bu" 4
lib.exe is normally used to build libraries, but link.exe with the /lib
option also works, so change win32/config.vc to use it instead:
.Sp
Change the line reading:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ar=\*(Aqlib\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ar=\*(Aqlink /lib\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
It may also be useful to create a batch file called lib.bat in
C:\eProgram Files\eMicrosoft Visual \*(C+ Toolkit 2003\ebin containing:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        @echo off
\&        link /lib %*
.Ve
.Sp
for the benefit of any naughty C extension modules that you might want to build
later which explicitly reference \*(L"lib\*(R" rather than taking their value from
\&\f(CW$Config\fR{ar}.
.IP "\(bu" 4
setargv.obj is required to build perlglob.exe (and perl.exe if the \s-1USE_SETARGV\s0
option is enabled).  The Platform \s-1SDK\s0 supplies this object file in source form
in \f(CW%PlatformSDKDir\fR%\esrc\ecrt.  Copy setargv.c, cruntime.h and
internal.h from there to some temporary location and build setargv.obj using
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        cl.exe /c /I. /D_CRTBLD setargv.c
.Ve
.Sp
Then copy setargv.obj to \f(CW%PlatformSDKDir\fR%\elib
.Sp
Alternatively, if you don't need perlglob.exe and don't need to enable the
\&\s-1USE_SETARGV\s0 option then you can safely just remove all mention of $(\s-1GLOBEXE\s0)
from win32/Makefile and setargv.obj won't be required anyway.

The definition of the fpos_t type in stdio.h may be wrong.  If your

Make sure you are in the \*(L"win32\*(R" subdirectory under the perl toplevel.
This directory contains a \*(L"Makefile\*(R" that will work with
versions of nmake that come with Visual \*(C+ or the Platform \s-1SDK\s0, and
a dmake \*(L"makefile.mk\*(R" that will work for all supported compilers.  The
defaults in the dmake makefile are setup to build using MinGW/gcc.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Edit the makefile.mk (or Makefile, if you're using nmake) and change
the values of \s-1INST_DRV\s0 and \s-1INST_TOP\s0.   You can also enable various
build flags.  These are explained in the makefiles.
.Sp
Note that it is generally not a good idea to try to build a perl with
\&\s-1INST_DRV\s0 and \s-1INST_TOP\s0 set to a path that already exists from a previous
build.  In particular, this may cause problems with the
lib/ExtUtils/t/Embed.t test, which attempts to build a test program and
may end up building against the installed perl's lib/CORE directory rather
than the one being tested.
.Sp
You will have to make sure that \s-1CCTYPE\s0 is set correctly and that
\&\s-1CCHOME\s0 points to wherever you installed your compiler. If building with
gcc\-4.x.x, you'll also need to uncomment the assignment to \s-1GCC_4XX\s0 and
uncomment the assignment to the appropriate \s-1GCCHELPERDLL\s0 in the makefile.mk.
.Sp
If building with the cross-compiler provided by
mingw\-w64.sourceforge.net you'll need to uncomment the line that sets
\&\s-1GCCCROSS\s0 in the makefile.mk. Do this only if it's the cross-compiler \- ie
only if the bin folder doesn't contain a gcc.exe. (The cross-compiler
does not provide a gcc.exe, g++.exe, ar.exe, etc. Instead, all of these
executables are prefixed with 'x86_64\-w64\-mingw32\-'.)
.Sp
The default value for \s-1CCHOME\s0 in the makefiles for Visual \*(C+
may not be correct for some versions.  Make sure the default exists
and is valid.
.Sp
You may also need to comment out the \f(CW\*(C`DELAYLOAD = ...\*(C'\fR line in the
Makefile if you're using \s-1VC++\s0 6.0 without the latest service pack and
the linker reports an internal error.
.Sp
If you are using \s-1VC++\s0 4.2 or earlier then you'll have to change the /EHsc
option in the \s-1CXX_FLAG\s0 macro to the equivalent /GX option.
.Sp
If you have either the source or a library that contains \fIdes_fcrypt()\fR,
enable the appropriate option in the makefile.  A ready-to-use version
of fcrypt.c, based on the version originally written by Eric Young at
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/crypt/mirrors/dsi/libdes/, is bundled with the
distribution and \s-1CRYPT_SRC\s0 is set to use it.
Alternatively, if you have built a library that contains \fIdes_fcrypt()\fR,
you can set \s-1CRYPT_LIB\s0 to point to the library name.
Perl will also build without \fIdes_fcrypt()\fR, but the \fIcrypt()\fR builtin will
fail at run time.

If you're using the Borland compiler, you may see a failure in op/taint.t
arising from the inability to find the Borland Runtime DLLs on the system
default path.  You will need to copy the DLLs reported by the messages

(usually somewhere like C:\eWINNT\eSYSTEM32) and rerun the test.
.PP
If you're using Borland compiler versions 5.2 and below, you may run into
problems finding the correct header files when building extensions.  For
example, building the \*(L"Tk\*(R" extension may fail because both perl and Tk
contain a header file called \*(L"patchlevel.h\*(R".  The latest Borland compiler
(v5.5) is free of this misbehaviour, and it even supports an
option \-VI\- for backward (bugward) compatibility for using the old Borland
search algorithm  to locate header files.

By default, perl handles file globbing using the File::Glob extension,

.IP "Using perl from the command line" 4
.IX Item "Using perl from the command line"
If you are accustomed to using perl from various command-line
shells found in \s-1UNIX\s0 environments, you will be less than pleased
with what Windows offers by way of a command shell.
.Sp
The crucial thing to understand about the Windows environment is that
the command line you type in is processed twice before Perl sees it.
First, your command shell (usually \s-1CMD\s0.EXE on Windows \s-1NT\s0, and
\&\s-1COMMAND\s0.COM on Windows 9x) preprocesses the command line, to handle
redirection, environment variable expansion, and location of the
executable to run. Then, the perl executable splits the remaining
command line into individual arguments, using the C runtime library
upon which Perl was built.
.Sp
It is particularly important to note that neither the shell nor the C
runtime do any wildcard expansions of command-line arguments (so
wildcards need not be quoted).  Also, the quoting behaviours of the
shell and the C runtime are rudimentary at best (and may, if you are
using a non-standard shell, be inconsistent).  The only (useful) quote
character is the double quote (").  It can be used to protect spaces
and other special characters in arguments.
.Sp
The Windows \s-1NT\s0 documentation has almost no description of how the
quoting rules are implemented, but here are some general observations
based on experiments: The C runtime breaks arguments at spaces and
passes them to programs in argc/argv.  Double quotes can be used to
prevent arguments with spaces in them from being split up.  You can
put a double quote in an argument by escaping it with a backslash and
enclosing the whole argument within double quotes.  The backslash and
the pair of double quotes surrounding the argument will be stripped by
the C runtime.
.Sp
The file redirection characters \*(L"<\*(R", \*(L">\*(R", and \*(L"|\*(R" can be quoted by
double quotes (although there are suggestions that this may not always
be true).  Single quotes are not treated as quotes by the shell or
the C runtime, they don't get stripped by the shell (just to make
this type of quoting completely useless).  The caret \*(L"^\*(R" has also
been observed to behave as a quoting character, but this appears
to be a shell feature, and the caret is not stripped from the command
line, so Perl still sees it (and the C runtime phase does not treat
the caret as a quote character).
.Sp
Here are some examples of usage of the \*(L"cmd\*(R" shell:
.Sp
This prints two doublequotes:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-e "print \*(Aq\e"\e"\*(Aq "
.Ve
.Sp
This does the same:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-e "print \e"\e\e\e"\e\e\e"\e" "
.Ve
.Sp
This prints \*(L"bar\*(R" and writes \*(L"foo\*(R" to the file \*(L"blurch\*(R":
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-e "print \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq; print STDERR \*(Aqbar\*(Aq" > blurch
.Ve
.Sp
This prints \*(L"foo\*(R" (\*(L"bar\*(R" disappears into nowhereland):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-e "print \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq; print STDERR \*(Aqbar\*(Aq" 2> nul
.Ve
.Sp
This prints \*(L"bar\*(R" and writes \*(L"foo\*(R" into the file \*(L"blurch\*(R":
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-e "print \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq; print STDERR \*(Aqbar\*(Aq" 1> blurch
.Ve
.Sp
This pipes \*(L"foo\*(R" to the \*(L"less\*(R" pager and prints \*(L"bar\*(R" on the console:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-e "print \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq; print STDERR \*(Aqbar\*(Aq" | less
.Ve
.Sp
This pipes \*(L"foo\enbar\en\*(R" to the less pager:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-le "print \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq; print STDERR \*(Aqbar\*(Aq" 2>&1 | less
.Ve
.Sp
This pipes \*(L"foo\*(R" to the pager and writes \*(L"bar\*(R" in the file \*(L"blurch\*(R":
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-e "print \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq; print STDERR \*(Aqbar\*(Aq" 2> blurch | less
.Ve
.Sp
Discovering the usefulness of the \*(L"command.com\*(R" shell on Windows 9x
is left as an exercise to the reader :)
.Sp
One particularly pernicious problem with the 4NT command shell for
Windows \s-1NT\s0 is that it (nearly) always treats a % character as indicating
that environment variable expansion is needed.  Under this shell, it is
therefore important to always double any % characters which you want
Perl to see (for example, for hash variables), even when they are
quoted.
.IP "Building Extensions" 4
.IX Item "Building Extensions"
The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (\s-1CPAN\s0) offers a wealth
of extensions, some of which require a C compiler to build.
Look in http://www.cpan.org/ for more information on \s-1CPAN\s0.
.Sp
Note that not all of the extensions available from \s-1CPAN\s0 may work
in the Win32 environment; you should check the information at
http://testers.cpan.org/ before investing too much effort into
porting modules that don't readily build.
.Sp
Most extensions (whether they require a C compiler or not) can
be built, tested and installed with the standard mantra:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    perl Makefile.PL
\&    $MAKE
\&    $MAKE test
\&    $MAKE install
.Ve
.Sp
where \f(CW$MAKE\fR is whatever 'make' program you have configured perl to
use.  Use \*(L"perl \-V:make\*(R" to find out what this is.  Some extensions
may not provide a testsuite (so \*(L"$MAKE test\*(R" may not do anything or
fail), but most serious ones do.
.Sp
It is important that you use a supported 'make' program, and
ensure Config.pm knows about it.  If you don't have nmake, you can
either get dmake from the location mentioned earlier or get an
old version of nmake reportedly available from:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN\-US/nmake15.exe
.Ve
.Sp
Another option is to use the make written in Perl, available from
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    http://www.cpan.org/modules/by\-module/Make/
.Ve
.Sp
You may also use dmake.  See \*(L"Make\*(R" above on how to get it.
.Sp
Note that MakeMaker actually emits makefiles with different syntax
depending on what 'make' it thinks you are using.  Therefore, it is
important that one of the following values appears in Config.pm:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    make=\*(Aqnmake\*(Aq        # MakeMaker emits nmake syntax
\&    make=\*(Aqdmake\*(Aq        # MakeMaker emits dmake syntax
\&    any other value     # MakeMaker emits generic make syntax
\&                            (e.g GNU make, or Perl make)
.Ve
.Sp
If the value doesn't match the 'make' program you want to use,
edit Config.pm to fix it.
.Sp
If a module implements XSUBs, you will need one of the supported
C compilers.  You must make sure you have set up the environment for
the compiler for command-line compilation.
.Sp
If a module does not build for some reason, look carefully for
why it failed, and report problems to the module author.  If
it looks like the extension building support is at fault, report
that with full details of how the build failed using the perlbug
utility.
.IP "Command-line Wildcard Expansion" 4
.IX Item "Command-line Wildcard Expansion"
The default command shells on \s-1DOS\s0 descendant operating systems (such
as they are) usually do not expand wildcard arguments supplied to
programs.  They consider it the application's job to handle that.
This is commonly achieved by linking the application (in our case,
perl) with startup code that the C runtime libraries usually provide.
However, doing that results in incompatible perl versions (since the
behavior of the argv expansion code differs depending on the
compiler, and it is even buggy on some compilers).  Besides, it may
be a source of frustration if you use such a perl binary with an
alternate shell that *does* expand wildcards.
.Sp
Instead, the following solution works rather well. The nice things
about it are 1) you can start using it right away; 2) it is more
powerful, because it will do the right thing with a pattern like
*/*/*.c; 3) you can decide whether you do/don't want to use it; and
4) you can extend the method to add any customizations (or even
entirely different kinds of wildcard expansion).
.Sp
.Vb 10

\&                    } @ARGV;
\&        1;
\&        ^Z

\&        perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
.Ve
.Sp
Note there are two distinct steps there: 1) You'll have to create
Wild.pm and put it in your perl lib directory. 2) You'll need to
set the \s-1PERL5OPT\s0 environment variable.  If you want argv expansion
to be the default, just set \s-1PERL5OPT\s0 in your default startup
environment.
.Sp
If you are using the Visual C compiler, you can get the C runtime's
command line wildcard expansion built into perl binary.  The resulting
binary will always expand unquoted command lines, which may not be
what you want if you use a shell that does that for you.  The expansion
done is also somewhat less powerful than the approach suggested above.
.IP "Win32 Specific Extensions" 4

be used under the Activeware port of Perl, which used to be the only

extensions typically do not support those tools either and, therefore,
cannot be built using the generic steps shown in the previous section.

.SS "Running Perl Scripts"
.IX Subsection "Running Perl Scripts"
Perl scripts on \s-1UNIX\s0 use the \*(L"#!\*(R" (a.k.a \*(L"shebang\*(R") line to
indicate to the \s-1OS\s0 that it should execute the file using perl.
Win32 has no comparable means to indicate arbitrary files are
executables.
.PP
Instead, all available methods to execute plain text files on
Win32 rely on the file \*(L"extension\*(R".  There are three methods
to use this to execute perl scripts:
.IP "1." 8
There is a facility called \*(L"file extension associations\*(R" that will
work in Windows \s-1NT\s0 4.0.  This can be manipulated via the two
commands \*(L"assoc\*(R" and \*(L"ftype\*(R" that come standard with Windows \s-1NT\s0
4.0.  Type \*(L"ftype /?\*(R" for a complete example of how to set this
up for perl scripts (Say what?  You thought Windows \s-1NT\s0 wasn't
perl-ready? :).
.IP "2." 8
Since file associations don't work everywhere, and there are
reportedly bugs with file associations where it does work, the
old method of wrapping the perl script to make it look like a
regular batch file to the \s-1OS\s0, may be used.  The install process
makes available the \*(L"pl2bat.bat\*(R" script which can be used to wrap
perl scripts into batch files.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        pl2bat foo.pl
.Ve
.Sp
will create the file \*(L"\s-1FOO\s0.BAT\*(R".  Note \*(L"pl2bat\*(R" strips any
\&.pl suffix and adds a .bat suffix to the generated file.
.Sp
If you use the 4DOS/NT or similar command shell, note that
\&\*(L"pl2bat\*(R" uses the \*(L"%*\*(R" variable in the generated batch file to
refer to all the command line arguments, so you may need to make
sure that construct works in batch files.  As of this writing,
4DOS/NT users will need a \*(L"ParameterChar = *\*(R" statement in their
4NT.INI file or will need to execute \*(L"setdos /p*\*(R" in the 4DOS/NT
startup file to enable this to work.

Using \*(L"pl2bat\*(R" has a few problems:  the file name gets changed,
so scripts that rely on \f(CW$0\fR to find what they must do may not
run properly; running \*(L"pl2bat\*(R" replicates the contents of the
original script, and so this process can be maintenance intensive
if the originals get updated often.  A different approach that
avoids both problems is possible.
.Sp
A script called \*(L"runperl.bat\*(R" is available that can be copied
to any filename (along with the .bat suffix).  For example,
if you call it \*(L"foo.bat\*(R", it will run the file \*(L"foo\*(R" when it is
executed.  Since you can run batch files on Win32 platforms simply
by typing the name (without the extension), this effectively
runs the file \*(L"foo\*(R", when you type either \*(L"foo\*(R" or \*(L"foo.bat\*(R".
With this method, \*(L"foo.bat\*(R" can even be in a different location
than the file \*(L"foo\*(R", as long as \*(L"foo\*(R" is available somewhere on
the \s-1PATH\s0.  If your scripts are on a filesystem that allows symbolic
links, you can even avoid copying \*(L"runperl.bat\*(R".
.Sp
Here's a diversion:  copy \*(L"runperl.bat\*(R" to \*(L"runperl\*(R", and type
\&\*(L"runperl\*(R".  Explain the observed behavior, or lack thereof. :)

A full set of \s-1HTML\s0 documentation is installed, so you should be
able to use it if you have a web browser installed on your
system.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`perldoc\*(C'\fR is also a useful tool for browsing information contained
in the documentation, especially in conjunction with a pager
like \f(CW\*(C`less\*(C'\fR (recent versions of which have Win32 support).  You may
have to set the \s-1PAGER\s0 environment variable to use a specific pager.
\&\*(L"perldoc \-f foo\*(R" will print information about the perl operator
\&\*(L"foo\*(R".
.PP
One common mistake when using this port with a \s-1GUI\s0 library like \f(CW\*(C`Tk\*(C'\fR
is assuming that Perl's normal behavior of opening a command-line
window will go away.  This isn't the case.  If you want to start a copy
of \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR without opening a command-line window, use the \f(CW\*(C`wperl\*(C'\fR
executable built during the installation process.  Usage is exactly
the same as normal \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR on Win32, except that options like \f(CW\*(C`\-h\*(C'\fR
don't work (since they need a command-line window to print to).
.PP
If you find bugs in perl, you can run \f(CW\*(C`perlbug\*(C'\fR to create a
bug report (you may have to send it manually if \f(CW\*(C`perlbug\*(C'\fR cannot
find a mailer on your system).

Norton AntiVirus interferes with the build process, particularly if
set to \*(L"AutoProtect, All Files, when Opened\*(R". Unlike large applications
the perl build process opens and modifies a lot of files. Having the
the AntiVirus scan each and every one slows build the process significantly.
Worse, with PERLIO=stdio the build process fails with peculiar messages
as the virus checker interacts badly with miniperl.exe writing configure
files (it seems to either catch file part written and treat it as suspicious,
or virus checker may have it \*(L"locked\*(R" in a way which inhibits miniperl
updating it). The build does complete with
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   set PERLIO=perlio
.Ve
.PP
but that may be just luck. Other AntiVirus software may have similar issues.
.PP
Some of the built-in functions do not act exactly as documented in
perlfunc, and a few are not implemented at all.  To avoid
surprises, particularly if you have had prior exposure to Perl
in other operating environments or if you intend to write code
that will be portable to other environments, see perlport
for a reasonably definitive list of these differences.
.PP
Not all extensions available from \s-1CPAN\s0 may build or work properly
in the Win32 environment.  See \*(L"Building Extensions\*(R".
.PP
Most \f(CW\*(C`socket()\*(C'\fR related calls are supported, but they may not
behave as on Unix platforms.  See perlport for the full list.
Perl requires Winsock2 to be installed on the system. If you're
running Win95, you can download Winsock upgrade from here:
.PP
http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/WUAdminTools/S_WUNetworkingTools/W95Sockets2/Default.asp
.PP
Later \s-1OS\s0 versions already include Winsock2 support.
.PP
Signal handling may not behave as on Unix platforms (where it
doesn't exactly \*(L"behave\*(R", either :).  For instance, calling \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR from signal handlers will cause an exception, since most
implementations of \f(CW\*(C`signal()\*(C'\fR on Win32 are severely crippled.
Thus, signals may work only for simple things like setting a flag
variable in the handler.  Using signals under this port should
currently be considered unsupported.
.PP
Please send detailed descriptions of any problems and solutions that
you may find to <\fIperlbug@perl.org\fR>, along with the output
produced by \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR.

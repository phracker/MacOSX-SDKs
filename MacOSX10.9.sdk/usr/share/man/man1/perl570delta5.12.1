.SH "NAME"
perl570delta \- what's new for perl v5.7.0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.6.0 release and
the 5.7.0 release.
.SH "Security Vulnerability Closed"
.IX Header "Security Vulnerability Closed"
A potential security vulnerability in the optional suidperl component
of Perl has been identified.  suidperl is neither built nor installed
by default.  As of September the 2nd, 2000, the only known vulnerable
platform is Linux, most likely all Linux distributions.  \s-1CERT\s0 and
various vendors have been alerted about the vulnerability.
.PP
The problem was caused by Perl trying to report a suspected security
exploit attempt using an external program, /bin/mail.  On Linux
platforms the /bin/mail program had an undocumented feature which
when combined with suidperl gave access to a root shell, resulting in
a serious compromise instead of reporting the exploit attempt.  If you
don't have /bin/mail, or if you have 'safe setuid scripts', or if
suidperl is not installed, you are safe.
.PP
The exploit attempt reporting feature has been completely removed from
the Perl 5.7.0 release, so that particular vulnerability isn't there
anymore.  However, further security vulnerabilities are,
unfortunately, always possible.  The suidperl code is being reviewed
and if deemed too risky to continue to be supported, it may be
completely removed from future releases.  In any case, suidperl should
only be used by security experts who know exactly what they are doing
and why they are using suidperl instead of some other solution such as
sudo ( see http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ ).
.SH "Incompatible Changes"

.IP "\(bu" 4
Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings:
constructs like \*(L"foo@bar\*(R" now always assume \f(CW@bar\fR is an array,
whether or not the compiler has seen use of \f(CW@bar\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The semantics of bless(\s-1REF\s0, \s-1REF\s0) were unclear and until someone proves
it to make some sense, it is forbidden.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A reference to a reference now stringify as \*(L"\s-1REF\s0(0x81485ec)\*(R" instead
of \*(L"\s-1SCALAR\s0(0x81485ec)\*(R" in order to be more consistent with the return
value of \fIref()\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The very dusty examples in the eg/ directory have been removed.
Suggestions for new shiny examples welcome but the main issue is that
the examples need to be documented, tested and (most importantly)
maintained.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The obsolete chat2 library that should never have been allowed
to escape the laboratory has been decommissioned.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The unimplemented \s-1POSIX\s0 regex features [[.cc.]] and [[=c=]] are still
recognised but now cause fatal errors.  The previous behaviour of
ignoring them by default and warning if requested was unacceptable
since it, in a way, falsely promised that the features could be used.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The (bogus) escape sequences \e8 and \e9 now give an optional warning
(\*(L"Unrecognized escape passed through\*(R").  There is no need to \e\-escape
any \f(CW\*(C`\ew\*(C'\fR character.
.IP "\(bu" 4
lstat(\s-1FILEHANDLE\s0) now gives a warning because the operation makes no sense.
In future releases this may become a fatal error.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The long deprecated uppercase aliases for the string comparison
operators (\s-1EQ\s0, \s-1NE\s0, \s-1LT\s0, \s-1LE\s0, \s-1GE\s0, \s-1GT\s0) have now been removed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The regular expression captured submatches ($1, \f(CW$2\fR, ...) are now
more consistently unset if the match fails, instead of leaving false
data lying around in them.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The tr///C and tr///U features have been removed and will not return;
the interface was a mistake.  Sorry about that.  For similar

\&\fImap()\fR that changes the size of the list should now work faster.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIsort()\fR has been changed to use mergesort internally as opposed to the
earlier quicksort.  For very small lists this may result in slightly
slower sorting times, but in general the speedup should be at least
20%.  Additional bonuses are that the worst case behaviour of \fIsort()\fR
is now better (in computer science terms it now runs in time O(N log N),
as opposed to quicksort's Theta(N**2) worst-case run time behaviour),
and that \fIsort()\fR is now stable (meaning that elements with identical
keys will stay ordered as they were before the sort).

\&\s-1INSTALL\s0 now explains how you can configure Perl to use 64\-bit

Policy.sh policy change: if you are reusing a Policy.sh file
(see \s-1INSTALL\s0) and you use Configure \-Dprefix=/foo/bar and in the old
Policy \f(CW$prefix\fR eq \f(CW$siteprefix\fR and \f(CW$prefix\fR eq \f(CW$vendorprefix\fR, all of
them will now be changed to the new prefix, /foo/bar.  (Previously
only \f(CW$prefix\fR changed.)  If you do not like this new behaviour,
specify prefix, siteprefix, and vendorprefix explicitly.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A new optional location for Perl libraries, otherlibdirs, is available.
It can be used for example for vendor add-ons without disturbing Perl's
own library directories.
.IP "\(bu" 4
In many platforms the vendor-supplied 'cc' is too stripped-down to
build Perl (basically, 'cc' doesn't do \s-1ANSI\s0 C).  If this seems
to be the case and 'cc' does not seem to be the \s-1GNU\s0 C compiler
\&'gcc', an automatic attempt is made to find and use 'gcc' instead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
gcc needs to closely track the operating system release to avoid
build problems. If Configure finds that gcc was built for a different
operating system release than is running, it now gives a clearly visible
warning that there may be trouble ahead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If binary compatibility with the 5.005 release is not wanted, Configure
no longer suggests including the 5.005 modules in \f(CW@INC\fR.

All regular expression compilation error messages are now hopefully
easier to understand both because the error message now comes before
the failed regex and because the point of failure is now clearly
marked.
.PP
The various \*(L"opened only for\*(R", \*(L"on closed\*(R", \*(L"never opened\*(R" warnings
drop the \f(CW\*(C`main::\*(C'\fR prefix for filehandles in the \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR package,
for example \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR instead of <main::STDIN>.

You can now build a really minimal perl called microperl.
Building microperl does not require even running Configure;
\&\f(CW\*(C`make \-f Makefile.micro\*(C'\fR should be enough.  Beware: microperl makes
many assumptions, some of which may be too bold; the resulting
executable may crash or otherwise misbehave in wondrous ways.
For careful hackers only.

.SS "Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles"
.IX Subsection "Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles"
Certain extensions like mod_perl and BSD::Resource are known to have
issues with `largefiles', a change brought by Perl 5.6.0 in which file
offsets default to 64 bits wide, where supported.  Modules may fail to
compile at all or compile and work incorrectly.  Currently there is no
good solution for the problem, but Configure now provides appropriate
non-largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs in the \f(CW%Config\fR
hash (e.g., \f(CW$Config\fR{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the extensions that are
having problems can try configuring themselves without the
largefileness.  This is admittedly not a clean solution, and the
solution may not even work at all.  One potential failure is whether
one can (or, if one can, whether it's a good idea) link together at
all binaries with different ideas about file offsets, all this is
platform-dependent.

If perl is configured with \-Duse64bitall, the successful result of the
subtest 10 of lib/posix may arrive before the successful result of the
subtest 9, which confuses the test harness so much that it thinks the
subtest 9 failed.

Many Storable tests fail on \s-1AIX\s0 configured with 64 bit integers.

So far unidentified problems break Storable in \s-1AIX\s0 if Perl is
configured to use 64 bit integers.  \s-1AIX\s0 in 32\-bit mode works and
other 64\-bit platforms work with Storable.

.SH "NAME"
perl572delta \- what's new for perl v5.7.2
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.7.1 release and the
5.7.2 release.
.PP
(To view the differences between the 5.6.0 release and the 5.7.0
release, see perl570delta.  To view the differences between the
5.7.0 release and the 5.7.1 release, see perl571delta.)
.SH "Security Vulnerability Closed"
.IX Header "Security Vulnerability Closed"
(This change was already made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.)
.PP
A security vulnerability affecting all Perl versions prior to 5.6.1
was found in August 2000.  The vulnerability does not affect default
installations and as far as is known affects only the Linux platform.
.PP
You should upgrade your Perl to 5.6.1 as soon as possible.  Patches
for earlier releases exist but using the patches require full
recompilation from the source code anyway, so 5.6.1 is your best
choice.
.PP
See http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl\-2000\-08\-05/sperl\-2000\-08\-05.txt
for more information.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "64\-bit platforms and malloc"
.IX Subsection "64-bit platforms and malloc"
If your pointers are 64 bits wide, the Perl malloc is no more being
used because it simply does not work with 8\-byte pointers.  Also,
usually the system malloc on such platforms are much better optimized
for such large memory models than the Perl malloc.
.SS "\s-1AIX\s0 Dynaloading"
.IX Subsection "AIX Dynaloading"
The \s-1AIX\s0 dynaloading now uses in \s-1AIX\s0 releases 4.3 and newer the native
dlopen interface of \s-1AIX\s0 instead of the old emulated interface.  This
change will probably break backward compatibility with compiled
modules.  The change was made to make Perl more compliant with other
applications like modperl which are using the \s-1AIX\s0 native interface.
.SS "Socket Extension Dynamic in \s-1VMS\s0"
.IX Subsection "Socket Extension Dynamic in VMS"
The Socket extension is now dynamically loaded instead of being
statically built in.  This may or may not be a problem with ancient
\&\s-1TCP/IP\s0 stacks of \s-1VMS:\s0 we do not know since we weren't able to test
Perl in such configurations.
.SS "Different Definition of the Unicode Character Classes \ep{In...}"
.IX Subsection "Different Definition of the Unicode Character Classes p{In...}"
As suggested by the Unicode consortium, the Unicode character classes
now prefer \fIscripts\fR as opposed to \fIblocks\fR (as defined by Unicode);
in Perl, when the \f(CW\*(C`\ep{In....}\*(C'\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`\ep{In....}\*(C'\fR regular expression
constructs are used.  This has changed the definition of some of those
character classes.
.PP
The difference between scripts and blocks is that scripts are the
glyphs used by a language or a group of languages, while the blocks
are more artificial groupings of 256 characters based on the Unicode
numbering.
.PP
In general this change results in more inclusive Unicode character
classes, but changes to the other direction also do take place:
for example while the script \f(CW\*(C`Latin\*(C'\fR includes all the Latin
characters and their various diacritic-adorned versions, it
does not include the various punctuation or digits (since they
are not solely \f(CW\*(C`Latin\*(C'\fR).
.PP
Changes in the character class semantics may have happened if a script
and a block happen to have the same name, for example \f(CW\*(C`Hebrew\*(C'\fR.
In such cases the script wins and \f(CW\*(C`\ep{InHebrew}\*(C'\fR now means the script
definition of Hebrew.  The block definition in still available,
though, by appending \f(CW\*(C`Block\*(C'\fR to the name: \f(CW\*(C`\ep{InHebrewBlock}\*(C'\fR means
what \f(CW\*(C`\ep{InHebrew}\*(C'\fR meant in perl 5.6.0.  For the full list
of affected character classes, see \*(L"Blocks\*(R" in perlunicode.
.SS "Deprecations"
.IX Subsection "Deprecations"
The current user-visible implementation of pseudo-hashes (the weird
use of the first array element) is deprecated starting from Perl 5.8.0
and will be removed in Perl 5.10.0, and the feature will be
implemented differently.  Not only is the current interface rather
ugly, but the current implementation slows down normal array and hash
use quite noticeably. The \f(CW\*(C`fields\*(C'\fR pragma interface will remain
available.
.PP
The syntaxes \f(CW\*(C`@a\->[...]\*(C'\fR and  \f(CW\*(C`@h\->{...}\*(C'\fR have now been deprecated.
.PP
The suidperl is also considered to be too much a risk to continue
maintaining and the suidperl code is likely to be removed in a future
release.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`package;\*(C'\fR syntax (\f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR without an argument has been
deprecated.  Its semantics were never that clear and its
implementation even less so.  If you have used that feature to
disallow all but fully qualified variables, \f(CW\*(C`use strict;\*(C'\fR instead.
.PP
The chdir(undef) and chdir('') behaviors to match \fIchdir()\fR has been
deprecated.  In future versions, chdir(undef) and chdir('') will
simply fail.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
In general a lot of fixing has happened in the area of Perl's
understanding of numbers, both integer and floating point.  Since in
many systems the standard number parsing functions like \f(CW\*(C`strtoul()\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`atof()\*(C'\fR seem to have bugs, Perl tries to work around their
deficiencies.  This results hopefully in more accurate numbers.

have been relaxed and simplified: now you can have an underscore

h2xs uses the new ExtUtils::Constant module which will affect
newly created extensions that define constants.  Since the new code is
more correct (if you have two constants where the first one is a

less lossy (it uses integers for integer constant, as opposed to the
old code that used floating point numbers even for integer constants),
and slightly faster, you might want to consider regenerating your

One cannot call Perl using the \f(CW\*(C`volume:\*(C'\fR syntax, that is, \f(CW\*(C`perl \-v\*(C'\fR
works, but for example \f(CW\*(C`bin:perl \-v\*(C'\fR doesn't.  The exact reason is
known but the current suspect is the \fIixemul\fR library.

.SS "HP-UX lib/io_multihomed Fails When LP64\-Configured"
.IX Subsection "HP-UX lib/io_multihomed Fails When LP64-Configured"
The lib/io_multihomed test may hang in HP-UX if Perl has been
configured to be 64\-bit. Because other 64\-bit platforms do not hang in
this test, HP-UX is suspect. All other tests pass in 64\-bit HP-UX. The
test attempts to create and connect to \*(L"multihomed\*(R" sockets (sockets
which have multiple \s-1IP\s0 addresses).
.SS "HP-UX lib/posix Subtest 9 Fails When LP64\-Configured"
.IX Subsection "HP-UX lib/posix Subtest 9 Fails When LP64-Configured"
If perl is configured with \-Duse64bitall, the successful result of the
subtest 10 of lib/posix may arrive before the successful result of the
subtest 9, which confuses the test harness so much that it thinks the
subtest 9 failed.

something other than \*(L"1\*(R" and \*(L"\-1\*(R" when formatting 0.6 and \-0.6 using

Self-tying of arrays and hashes is broken in rather deep and
hard-to-fix ways.  As a stop-gap measure to avoid people from getting
frustrated at the mysterious results (core dumps, most often) it is
for now forbidden (you will get a fatal error even from an attempt).

.SS "Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles"
.IX Subsection "Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles"
Some extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with
`largefiles', a change brought by Perl 5.6.0 in which file offsets
default to 64 bits wide, where supported.  Modules may fail to compile
at all or compile and work incorrectly.  Currently there is no good
solution for the problem, but Configure now provides appropriate
non-largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs in the \f(CW%Config\fR
hash (e.g., \f(CW$Config\fR{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the extensions that are
having problems can try configuring themselves without the
largefileness.  This is admittedly not a clean solution, and the
solution may not even work at all.  One potential failure is whether
one can (or, if one can, whether it's a good idea) link together at
all binaries with different ideas about file offsets, all this is
platform-dependent.

.IX Subsection "The Compiler Suite Is Still Experimental"

.SS "The Long Double Support is Still Experimental"
.IX Subsection "The Long Double Support is Still Experimental"
The ability to configure Perl's numbers to use \*(L"long doubles\*(R",
floating point numbers of hopefully better accuracy, is still
experimental.  The implementations of long doubles are not yet
widespread and the existing implementations are not quite mature
or standardised, therefore trying to support them is a rare
and moving target.  The gain of more precision may also be offset
by slowdown in computations (more bits to move around, and the
operations are more likely to be executed by less optimised
libraries).

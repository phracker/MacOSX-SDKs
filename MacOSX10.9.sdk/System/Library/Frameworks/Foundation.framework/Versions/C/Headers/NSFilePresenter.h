/* A protocol to be implemented by objects that present the contents of files or directories to the user for viewing or editing. The objects can take an active role in operations that access those files or directories, even operations performed by other processes in the system. For an NSFilePresenter to be aware of such file access it must be "coordinated" file access. The NSFileCoordinator class that is used to do coordinated file access is declared in <Foundation/NSFileCoordinator.h>. Starting in version 10.7 many components of Mac OS X use NSFileCoordinator, including AppKit, Finder, and various applications. NSDocument conforms to the NSFilePresenter protocol and has useful implementations of all of its methods. You are unlikely to have to implement NSFilePresenter yourself in an NSDocument-based application.

See the comments for -[NSFileCoordinator initWithFilePresenter:] for information about how an NSFilePresenter can avoid receiving messages about its own reading and writing.

You can consider "item" in method names in this header file to be an abbreviation of "fileOrDirectory." As always, a directory might actually be a file package.

/* The NSURL that locates the file or directory that the receiver is presenting to the user. Implementations of this method must be prepared to be invoked by Cocoa in any queue, at any time, including from within invocations of NSFileCoordinator methods. A nil value is valid and means that the presented item does not exist yet. An NSFilePresenter with a nil presentedItemURL will be asked for its presentedItemURL again when coordinated file access on behalf of that NSFilePresenter completes, in case the presented item was just created.

For example, NSDocument has a -presentedItemURL method that usually returns [self fileURL]. In a shoebox application that stores the user's data in files somewhere on the user's computer you can implement this method to specify the directory that contains those files.

For example, NSDocument has a -presentedItemOperationQueue method that returns a private queue. In very simple cases you can return [NSOperationQueue mainQueue], but doing so is often an invitation to deadlocks.

/* Support for App Sandbox on OS X. Some applications, given a user-selected file, require access to additional files or directories with related names. For example, a movie player might have to automatically load subtitles for a movie that the user opened. By convention, the subtitle file has the same name as the movie, but a different file extension. If the movie player is sandboxed, its use of NSOpenPanel will grant it access to the user-selected movie (the primary item). However, access to the subtitle file (the secondary item) will not be granted by NSOpenPanel. To get access to a secondary item, a process can register an NSFilePresenter for it and unregister the NSFilePresenter once the application is finished accessing it. Each NSFilePresenter of a secondary item must return an NSURL to the primary item on request. You make that happen by providing an implementation of -primaryPresentedItemURL that returns an NSURL for the primary item.

Implementations of this method must always invoke the completion handler because other parts of the system will wait until it is invoked or the user loses patience and cancels the waiting. If this method is not implemented then the NSFilePresenter is assumed to be one that never lets the user make changes that need to be saved.

For example, NSDocument has an implementation of this method that autosaves the document if it has been changed since the last time it was saved or autosaved. That way when another process tries to read the document file it always reads the same version of the document that the user is looking at in your application. (WYSIWGCBF - What You See Is What Gets Copied By Finder.) A shoebox application would also implement this method.

The file coordination mechanism does not always send -relinquishPresentedItemToReader: or -relinquishPresentedItemToWriter: to your NSFilePresenter before sending this message. For example, other process' use of -[NSFileCoordinator prepareForReadingItemsAtURLs:options:writingItemsAtURLs:options:error:byAccessor:] can cause this to happen.

Implementations of this method must always invoke the completion handler because other parts of the system will wait until it is invoked or until the user loses patience and cancels the waiting.

For example, NSDocument has an implementation of this method that closes the document. That way if the document is in the trash and the user empties the trash the document is simply closed before its file is deleted. This means that emptying the trash will not fail with an alert about the file being "in use" just because the document's file is memory mapped by the application. It also means that the document won't be left open with no document file underneath it. A shoebox application would only implement this method to be robust against surprising things like the user deleting its data directory while the application is running.

The file coordination mechanism does not always send -relinquishPresentedItemToReader: or -relinquishPresentedItemToWriter: to your NSFilePresenter before sending this message.

To avoid race conditions, getting the modification date should typically be done within invocations of one of the -[NSFileCoordinator coordinate...] methods.

For example, NSDocument implements this method to react to both contents changes (like the user overwriting the document file with another application) and attribute changes (like the user toggling the "Hide extension" checkbox in a Finder info panel).

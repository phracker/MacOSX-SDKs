 * @class IOAudioDevice
 * @abstract Abstract base class for a single piece of audio hardware.  The IOAudioDevice provides
 *  the central coordination point for an audio driver.
 * @discussion An audio driver is required to subclass IOAudioDevice in order to provide
 *  working audio to the system.  A single driver instance will contain a single instance of the 
 *  driver's IOAudioDevice subclass.  The subclass is responsible for mapping all hardware device
 *  resources from the service provider nub.  It must control access to the hardware so that the
 *  hardware doesn't get into an inconsistent state.  It is possible that different threads may make
 *  requests of the hardware at the same time.  The IOAudioDevice superclass provides an IOWorkLoop
 *  and IOCommandGate on the IOWorkLoop through which all hardware accesses may be synchronized.
 *  All entry points to all parts of the driver controlled by the IOAudioFamily will be synchronized
 *  through this one IOWorkLoop.
 *
 *  The IOAudioDevice subclass is responsible for creating the rest of the pieces of the driver.
 *  It must identify and create all IOAudioEngines that are not automatically created by the system
 *  (i.e. those that are not matched and instantiated by IOKit directly).
 *
 *  The IOAudioDevice subclass must enumerate and create all IOAudioControls to match
 *  the device capabilities.
 *
 *  It must also execute control value chages when requested by the system (i.e. volume adjustments).
 *
 *  In order to allow sleep and wake to work on the system, the IOAudioDevice subclass is responsible
 *  for performing the necessary actions to sleep and wake its hardware (and restore necessary state
 *  on wake).
 *
 *  The IOAudioDevice class provides timer services that allow different elements in the audio driver
 *  to receive timer notifications as needed.  These services were designed with the idea that most
 *  timed events in a typical audio driver need to be done at least as often as a certain interval.
 *  Further, it is designed with the idea that being called more often than the specified interval
 *  doesn't hurt anything - and in fact may help.  With this in mind, the timer services provided
 *  by the IOAudioDevice class allow different targets to register for timer callbacks at least as
 *  often as the specified interval.  The actual interval will be the smallest of the intervals of
 *  all of the callbacks.  This way, we avoid the overhead of having many timers in a single audio
 *  device.  As an example, each output IOAudioEngine has a timer to run the erase head.  It doesn't hurt
 *  to have the erase head run more often.  Also, a typical IOAudioDevice subclass may need to run a timer
 *  to check for device state changes (e.g. jack insertions).
 *
 *  There are a number of strings passed from the driver to the CoreAudio.framework and then into
 *  applications.  All of those strings should be localized by the driver.  In order to do that
 *  the kext bundle should have localized string files following the Mac OS X localization 
 *  instructions.  The IOAudioDevice should contain a property with the name of the bundle/kext
 *  that contains the localized string resources.  To do that, the driver's personality in 
 *  the bundle resources could have a property named 'IOAudioDeviceLocalizedBundle' with the path 
 *  of the bundle/kext relative to '/System/Library/Extensions'.  It could also be set by the 
 *  IOAudioDevice subclass in its initHardware() function.  To do so, call
 *  setProperty(kIOAudioDeviceLocalizedBundleKey, "Driver.kext").
 *
 *  In a typical driver, the IOAudioDevice subclass will implement initHardware() to perform the
 *  hardware initialization and driver construction.  Within that initialization it must create at 
 *  least one IOAudioEngine instance and activate it.  In order to activate a new IOAudioEngine
 *  activateAudioEngine() should be called for each one.  It must create the IOAudioControls 
 *  matching the hardware capabilities to allow the system to set volume, mute and input selection.  
 *  To add those controls to the driver, each control should be attached to the IOAudioEngine to
 *  which it applies by calling addDefaultAudioControl() on the IOAudioEngine.
 *  During initialization it should also call setDeviceName(), setDeviceShortName() and 
 *  setManufacturerName() with localized strings representing each of the attributes.
 *
 *  If the driver is to work properly after sleep/wake, it must implement performPowerStateChange()
 *  and deal with the sleep and wake transitions.  It may also deal with the idle state transitions
 *  to turn off device power when it isn't in use (especially useful for devices attached to a 
 *  portable running on battery power).

 * The structure used to implement Tcl "exceptions" (exceptional returns): for
 * example, those generated in loops by the break and continue commands, and
 * those generated by scripts and caught by the catch command. This
 * ExceptionRange structure describes a range of code (e.g., a loop body), the
 * kind of exceptions (e.g., a break or continue) that might occur, and the PC
 * offsets to jump to if a matching exception does occur. Exception ranges can
 * nest so this structure includes a nesting level that is used at runtime to
 * find the closest exception range surrounding a PC. For example, when a
 * break command is executed, the ExceptionRange structure for the most deeply
 * nested loop, if any, is found and used. These structures are also generated
 * for the "next" subcommands of for loops since a break there terminates the
 * for command. This means a for command actually generates two LoopInfo

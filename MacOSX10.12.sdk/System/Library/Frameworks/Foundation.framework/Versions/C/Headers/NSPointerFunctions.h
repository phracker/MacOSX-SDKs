  NSPointerFunctions

  This object defines callout functions appropriate for managing a pointer reference held somewhere else.

  Used by NSHashTable, NSMapTable, and NSPointerArray, this object defines the acquision and retention behavior for the pointers provided to these collection objects.

   The functions are separated into two clusters - those that define "personality", such as object or cString, and those that describe memory management issues such as a memory deallocation function.  Common personalities and memory manager selections are provided as enumerations, and further customization is provided by methods such that the composition of the actual list of functions is done opaquely such that they can be extended in the future.

  The pointer collections copy NSPointerFunctions objects on input and output, and so NSPointerFunctions is not usefully subclassed.

   Cheat Sheet
 
   Long Integers (other than zero)   (NSPointerFunctionsOpaqueMemory | NSPointerFunctionsIntegerPersonality)
      useful for, well, anything that can be jammed into a long int
 
   Strongly held objects             (NSPointerFunctionsStrongMemory | NSPointerFunctionsObjectPersonality)
      used for retained objects under ARC and/or manual retain-release, or GC; uses isEqual: as necessary
 
   Zeroing weak object references    (NSPointerFunctionsWeakMemory   | NSPointerFunctionsObjectPersonality)
      used to hold references that won't keep the object alive.  Note that objects implementing custom retain-release must also implement allowsWeakReference and retainWeakReference (or are using GC instead)
 
   Unsafe unretained objects         (NSPointerFunctionsOpaqueMemory | NSPointerFunctionsObjectPersonality)
      used where zeroing weak is not possible and where, somehow, the objects are removed before being deallocated.
 
   C String where table keeps copy   (NSPointerFunctionsStrongMemory | NSPointerFunctionsCStringPersonality | NSPointerFunctionsCopyIn)
      used to capture a null-terminated string from a source with unknown lifetime.  Keeps string alive under GC.  Under ARC/RR, table will deallocate its copy when removed.  Generally, "C Strings" is a term for UTF8 strings as well.
 
   C String, owned elsewhere         (NSPointerFunctionsOpaqueMemory | NSPointerFunctionsCStringPersonality)
      used to hold C string pointers to storage not at all managed by the table.
 
 
   The NSPointerFunctionsObjectPersonality dictates using isEqual: for the equality test.  In some situations == should be used, such as when trying to build a cache of unique immutable "value" objects that implement isEqual:.  In those cases use NSPointerFunctionsObjectPointerPersonality instead.

   Deprecated
 
   GC Zeroing - ARC/RR unsafe weak   (NSPointerFunctionsZeroingWeakMemory   | NSPointerFunctionsObjectPersonality)
       under GC these are zeroing weak but under manual retain-release (or ARC) these are unsafe unretained. Move to NSPointerFunctionsWeakMemory or NSPointerFunctionsOpaqueMemory instead.
 
 
   Example
       Lets say you have a source of C Strings that often repeat and you need to provide unique NSString counterparts.  For this you likely want a NSMapTable with strong copy-in C Strings as the keys and weak NSString values.  As long as the NSString counterparts are in use, they stay in the table and don't need to be created each time they show up.
       NSMapTable *mt = [[NSMapTable alloc] 
                            initWithKeyOptions: (NSPointerFunctionsStrongMemory | NSPointerFunctionsCStringPersonality | NSPointerFunctionsCopyIn)
                            valueOptions:(NSPointerFunctionsWeakMemory   | NSPointerFunctionsObjectPersonality)
                            capacity:0];
       ...
       // given a C string, look it up and, if not found, create and save the NSString version in the table
       const char *cString = ...;
       NSString *result = [mt objectForKey:(id)cString];
       if (!result) {
            result = [NSString stringWithCString:cString];
            [mt setObject:result forKey:(id)cString];
        }
        return result;

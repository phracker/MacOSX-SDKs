/* A CGGradient defines a transition between colors. The transition is
   defined over a range from 0 to 1 inclusive. A gradient specifies a color
   at location 0, one at location 1, and possibly additional colors assigned
   to locations between 0 and 1.

   A CGGradient has a color space. When a gradient is created, all colors
   specified are converted to that color space, and interpolation of colors
   occurs using the components of that color space. See the documentation of
   each creation function for more details. */

 @discussion
 Unlike in OpenGL and OpenCL, access to buffers is not synchronized.  The caller may use the CPU to modify the data at any time
 but is also responsible for ensuring synchronization and coherency.
 
 The contents become undefined if both the CPU and GPU write to the same buffer without a synchronizing action between those writes.
 This is true even when the regions written do not overlap.

 @abstract Inform the device of the range of a buffer that the CPU has modified, allowing the implementation to invalidate 
 its caches of the buffer's content.
 @discussion When the application writes to a buffer's sysmem copy via @a contents, that range of the buffer immediately 
 becomes undefined for any accesses by the GPU (MTLDevice).  To restore coherency, the buffer modification must be followed
 by -didModifyRange:, and then followed by a commit of the MTLCommandBuffer that will access the buffer.
 -didModifyRange does not make the contents coherent for any previously committed command buffers.
 Note: This method is only required if buffer is created with a storage mode of MTLResourceStorageModeManaged.
 It is not valid to invoke this method on buffers of other storage modes.

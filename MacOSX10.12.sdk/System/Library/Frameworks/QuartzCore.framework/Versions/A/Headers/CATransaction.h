/* Transactions are CoreAnimation's mechanism for batching multiple layer-
 * tree operations into atomic updates to the render tree. Every
 * modification to the layer tree requires a transaction to be part of.
 *
 * CoreAnimation supports two kinds of transactions, "explicit" transactions
 * and "implicit" transactions.
 *
 * Explicit transactions are where the programmer calls `[CATransaction
 * begin]' before modifying the layer tree, and `[CATransaction commit]'
 * afterwards.
 *
 * Implicit transactions are created automatically by CoreAnimation when the
 * layer tree is modified by a thread without an active transaction.
 * They are committed automatically when the thread's run-loop next
 * iterates. In some circumstances (i.e. no run-loop, or the run-loop
 * is blocked) it may be necessary to use explicit transactions to get
 * timely render tree updates. */

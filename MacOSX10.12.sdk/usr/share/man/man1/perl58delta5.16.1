.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.6.0 release and
the 5.8.0 release.
.PP
Many of the bug fixes in 5.8.0 were already seen in the 5.6.1
maintenance release since the two releases were kept closely
coordinated (while 5.8.0 was still called 5.7.something).
.PP
Changes that were integrated into the 5.6.1 release are marked \f(CW\*(C`[561]\*(C'\fR.
Many of these changes have been further developed since 5.6.1 was released,
those are marked \f(CW\*(C`[561+]\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You can see the list of changes in the 5.6.1 release (both from the
5.005_03 release and the 5.6.0 release) by reading perl561delta.

.IX Subsection "Binary Incompatibility"
\&\fBPerl 5.8 is not binary compatible with earlier releases of Perl.\fR
.PP
\&\fBYou have to recompile your \s-1XS\s0 modules.\fR
.PP
(Pure Perl modules should continue to work.)
.PP
The major reason for the discontinuity is the new \s-1IO\s0 architecture
called PerlIO.  PerlIO is the default configuration because without
it many new features of Perl 5.8 cannot be used.  In other words:
you just have to recompile your modules containing \s-1XS\s0 code, sorry
about that.
.PP
In future releases of Perl, non-PerlIO aware \s-1XS\s0 modules may become
completely unsupported.  This shouldn't be too difficult for module
authors, however: PerlIO has been designed as a drop-in replacement
(at the source code level) for the stdio interface.
.PP
Depending on your platform, there are also other reasons why
we decided to break binary compatibility, please read on.
.SS "64\-bit platforms and malloc"
.IX Subsection "64-bit platforms and malloc"
If your pointers are 64 bits wide, the Perl malloc is no longer being
used because it does not work well with 8\-byte pointers.  Also,
usually the system mallocs on such platforms are much better optimized
for such large memory models than the Perl malloc.  Some memory-hungry
Perl applications like the \s-1PDL\s0 don't work well with Perl's malloc.
Finally, other applications than Perl (such as mod_perl) tend to prefer
the system malloc.  Such platforms include Alpha and 64\-bit \s-1HPPA\s0,
\&\s-1MIPS\s0, \s-1PPC\s0, and Sparc.
.SS "\s-1AIX\s0 Dynaloading"
.IX Subsection "AIX Dynaloading"
The \s-1AIX\s0 dynaloading now uses in \s-1AIX\s0 releases 4.3 and newer the native
dlopen interface of \s-1AIX\s0 instead of the old emulated interface.  This
change will probably break backward compatibility with compiled
modules.  The change was made to make Perl more compliant with other
applications like mod_perl which are using the \s-1AIX\s0 native interface.
.ie n .SS "Attributes for ""my"" variables now handled at run-time"
.el .SS "Attributes for \f(CWmy\fP variables now handled at run-time"
.IX Subsection "Attributes for my variables now handled at run-time"
The \f(CW\*(C`my EXPR : ATTRS\*(C'\fR syntax now applies variable attributes at
run-time.  (Subroutine and \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR variables still get attributes applied
at compile-time.)  See attributes for additional details.  In particular,
however, this allows variable attributes to be useful for \f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR interfaces,
which was a deficiency of earlier releases.  Note that the new semantics
doesn't work with the Attribute::Handlers module (as of version 0.76).
.SS "Socket Extension Dynamic in \s-1VMS\s0"
.IX Subsection "Socket Extension Dynamic in VMS"
The Socket extension is now dynamically loaded instead of being
statically built in.  This may or may not be a problem with ancient
\&\s-1TCP/IP\s0 stacks of \s-1VMS:\s0 we do not know since we weren't able to test
Perl in such configurations.
.SS "IEEE-format Floating Point Default on OpenVMS Alpha"
.IX Subsection "IEEE-format Floating Point Default on OpenVMS Alpha"
Perl now uses \s-1IEEE\s0 format (T_FLOAT) as the default internal floating
point format on OpenVMS Alpha, potentially breaking binary compatibility
with external libraries or existing data.  G_FLOAT is still available as
a configuration option.  The default on \s-1VAX\s0 (D_FLOAT) has not changed.
.ie n .SS "New Unicode Semantics (no more ""use utf8"", almost)"
.el .SS "New Unicode Semantics (no more \f(CWuse utf8\fP, almost)"
.IX Subsection "New Unicode Semantics (no more use utf8, almost)"
Previously in Perl 5.6 to use Unicode one would say \*(L"use utf8\*(R" and
then the operations (like string concatenation) were Unicode-aware
in that lexical scope.
.PP
This was found to be an inconvenient interface, and in Perl 5.8 the
Unicode model has completely changed: now the \*(L"Unicodeness\*(R" is bound
to the data itself, and for most of the time \*(L"use utf8\*(R" is not needed
at all.  The only remaining use of \*(L"use utf8\*(R" is when the Perl script
itself has been written in the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoding of Unicode.  (\s-1UTF\-8\s0 has
not been made the default since there are many Perl scripts out there
that are using various national eight-bit character sets, which would
be illegal in \s-1UTF\-8\s0.)
.PP
See perluniintro for the explanation of the current model,
and utf8 for the current use of the utf8 pragma.
.SS "New Unicode Properties"
.IX Subsection "New Unicode Properties"
Unicode \fIscripts\fR are now supported. Scripts are similar to (and superior
to) Unicode \fIblocks\fR. The difference between scripts and blocks is that
scripts are the glyphs used by a language or a group of languages, while
the blocks are more artificial groupings of (mostly) 256 characters based
on the Unicode numbering.
.PP
In general, scripts are more inclusive, but not universally so. For
example, while the script \f(CW\*(C`Latin\*(C'\fR includes all the Latin characters and
their various diacritic-adorned versions, it does not include the various
punctuation or digits (since they are not solely \f(CW\*(C`Latin\*(C'\fR).
.PP
A number of other properties are now supported, including \f(CW\*(C`\ep{L&}\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{Any}\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Assigned}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Unassigned}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Blank}\*(C'\fR [561] and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{SpacePerl}\*(C'\fR [561] (along with their \f(CW\*(C`\eP{...}\*(C'\fR versions, of course).
See perlunicode for details, and more additions.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`In\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Is\*(C'\fR prefix to names used with the \f(CW\*(C`\ep{...}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eP{...}\*(C'\fR
are now almost always optional. The only exception is that a \f(CW\*(C`In\*(C'\fR prefix
is required to signify a Unicode block when a block name conflicts with a
script name. For example, \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Tibetan}\*(C'\fR refers to the script, while
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{InTibetan}\*(C'\fR refers to the block. When there is no name conflict, you
can omit the \f(CW\*(C`In\*(C'\fR from the block name (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`\ep{BraillePatterns}\*(C'\fR), but
to be safe, it's probably best to always use the \f(CW\*(C`In\*(C'\fR).
.SS "\s-1REF\s0(...) Instead Of \s-1SCALAR\s0(...)"
.IX Subsection "REF(...) Instead Of SCALAR(...)"
A reference to a reference now stringifies as \*(L"\s-1REF\s0(0x81485ec)\*(R" instead
of \*(L"\s-1SCALAR\s0(0x81485ec)\*(R" in order to be more consistent with the return
value of \fIref()\fR.
.SS "pack/unpack D/F recycled"
.IX Subsection "pack/unpack D/F recycled"
The undocumented pack/unpack template letters D/F have been recycled
for better use: now they stand for long double (if supported by the
platform) and \s-1NV\s0 (Perl internal floating point type).  (They used
to be aliases for d/f, but you never knew that.)
.SS "\fIglob()\fP now returns filenames in alphabetical order"
.IX Subsection "glob() now returns filenames in alphabetical order"
The list of filenames from \fIglob()\fR (or <...>) is now by default sorted
alphabetically to be csh-compliant (which is what happened before
in most Unix platforms).  (\fIbsd_glob()\fR does still sort platform
natively, \s-1ASCII\s0 or \s-1EBCDIC\s0, unless \s-1GLOB_ALPHASORT\s0 is specified.) [561]
.SS "Deprecations"
.IX Subsection "Deprecations"
.IP "\(bu" 4
The semantics of bless(\s-1REF\s0, \s-1REF\s0) were unclear and until someone proves
it to make some sense, it is forbidden.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The obsolete chat2 library that should never have been allowed
to escape the laboratory has been decommissioned.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Using chdir("") or chdir(undef) instead of explicit \fIchdir()\fR is
doubtful.  A failure (think chdir(\fIsome_function()\fR) can lead into
unintended \fIchdir()\fR to the home directory, therefore this behaviour
is deprecated.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The builtin \fIdump()\fR function has probably outlived most of its
usefulness.  The core-dumping functionality will remain in future
available as an explicit call to \f(CW\*(C`CORE::dump()\*(C'\fR, but in future
releases the behaviour of an unqualified \f(CW\*(C`dump()\*(C'\fR call may change.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The very dusty examples in the eg/ directory have been removed.
Suggestions for new shiny examples welcome but the main issue is that
the examples need to be documented, tested and (most importantly)
maintained.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The (bogus) escape sequences \e8 and \e9 now give an optional warning
(\*(L"Unrecognized escape passed through\*(R").  There is no need to \e\-escape
any \f(CW\*(C`\ew\*(C'\fR character.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The *glob{\s-1FILEHANDLE\s0} is deprecated, use *glob{\s-1IO\s0} instead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`package;\*(C'\fR syntax (\f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR without an argument) has been
deprecated.  Its semantics were never that clear and its
implementation even less so.  If you have used that feature to
disallow all but fully qualified variables, \f(CW\*(C`use strict;\*(C'\fR instead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The unimplemented \s-1POSIX\s0 regex features [[.cc.]] and [[=c=]] are still
recognised but now cause fatal errors.  The previous behaviour of
ignoring them by default and warning if requested was unacceptable
since it, in a way, falsely promised that the features could be used.
.IP "\(bu" 4
In future releases, non-PerlIO aware \s-1XS\s0 modules may become completely
unsupported.  Since PerlIO is a drop-in replacement for stdio at the
source code level, this shouldn't be that drastic a change.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Previous versions of perl and some readings of some sections of Camel
\&\s-1III\s0 implied that the \f(CW\*(C`:raw\*(C'\fR \*(L"discipline\*(R" was the inverse of \f(CW\*(C`:crlf\*(C'\fR.
Turning off \*(L"clrfness\*(R" is no longer enough to make a stream truly
binary. So the PerlIO \f(CW\*(C`:raw\*(C'\fR layer (or \*(L"discipline\*(R", to use the Camel
book's older terminology) is now formally defined as being equivalent
to binmode(\s-1FH\s0) \- which is in turn defined as doing whatever is
necessary to pass each byte as-is without any translation.  In
particular binmode(\s-1FH\s0) \- and hence \f(CW\*(C`:raw\*(C'\fR \- will now turn off both
\&\s-1CRLF\s0 and \s-1UTF\-8\s0 translation and remove other layers (e.g. :\fIencoding()\fR)
which would modify byte stream.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The current user-visible implementation of pseudo-hashes (the weird
use of the first array element) is deprecated starting from Perl 5.8.0
and will be removed in Perl 5.10.0, and the feature will be
implemented differently.  Not only is the current interface rather
ugly, but the current implementation slows down normal array and hash
use quite noticeably. The \f(CW\*(C`fields\*(C'\fR pragma interface will remain
available.  The \fIrestricted hashes\fR interface is expected to
be the replacement interface (see Hash::Util).  If your existing
programs depends on the underlying implementation, consider using
Class::PseudoHash from \s-1CPAN\s0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The syntaxes \f(CW\*(C`@a\->[...]\*(C'\fR and  \f(CW\*(C`%h\->{...}\*(C'\fR have now been deprecated.
.IP "\(bu" 4
After years of trying, suidperl is considered to be too complex to
ever be considered truly secure.  The suidperl functionality is likely
to be removed in a future release.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The 5.005 threads model (module \f(CW\*(C`Thread\*(C'\fR) is deprecated and expected
to be removed in Perl 5.10.  Multithreaded code should be migrated to
the new ithreads model (see threads, threads::shared and
perlthrtut).
.IP "\(bu" 4
The long deprecated uppercase aliases for the string comparison
operators (\s-1EQ\s0, \s-1NE\s0, \s-1LT\s0, \s-1LE\s0, \s-1GE\s0, \s-1GT\s0) have now been removed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The tr///C and tr///U features have been removed and will not return;
the interface was a mistake.  Sorry about that.  For similar
functionality, see pack('U0', ...) and pack('C0', ...). [561]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Earlier Perls treated \*(L"sub foo (@bar)\*(R" as equivalent to \*(L"sub foo (@)\*(R".
The prototypes are now checked better at compile-time for invalid
syntax.  An optional warning is generated (\*(L"Illegal character in
prototype...\*(R")  but this may be upgraded to a fatal error in a future
release.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`exec LIST\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`system LIST\*(C'\fR operations now produce warnings on
tainted data and in some future release they will produce fatal errors.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The existing behaviour when localising tied arrays and hashes is wrong,
and will be changed in a future release, so do not rely on the existing
behaviour. See \*(L"Localising Tied Arrays and Hashes Is Broken\*(R".
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "Unicode Overhaul"
.IX Subsection "Unicode Overhaul"
Unicode in general should be now much more usable than in Perl 5.6.0
(or even in 5.6.1).  Unicode can be used in hash keys, Unicode in
regular expressions should work now, Unicode in tr/// should work now,
Unicode in I/O should work now.  See perluniintro for introduction
and perlunicode for details.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The Unicode Character Database coming with Perl has been upgraded
to Unicode 3.2.0.  For more information, see http://www.unicode.org/ .
[561+] (5.6.1 has \s-1UCD\s0 3.0.1.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
For developers interested in enhancing Perl's Unicode capabilities:
almost all the \s-1UCD\s0 files are included with the Perl distribution in
the \fIlib/unicore\fR subdirectory.  The most notable omission, for space
considerations, is the Unihan database.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The properties \ep{Blank} and \ep{SpacePerl} have been added. \*(L"Blank\*(R" is like
C \fIisblank()\fR, that is, it contains only \*(L"horizontal whitespace\*(R" (the space
character is, the newline isn't), and the \*(L"SpacePerl\*(R" is the Unicode
equivalent of \f(CW\*(C`\es\*(C'\fR (\ep{Space} isn't, since that includes the vertical
tabulator character, whereas \f(CW\*(C`\es\*(C'\fR doesn't.)
.Sp
See \*(L"New Unicode Properties\*(R" earlier in this document for additional
information on changes with Unicode properties.
.SS "PerlIO is Now The Default"
.IX Subsection "PerlIO is Now The Default"
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1IO\s0 is now by default done via PerlIO rather than system's \*(L"stdio\*(R".
PerlIO allows \*(L"layers\*(R" to be \*(L"pushed\*(R" onto a file handle to alter the
handle's behaviour.  Layers can be specified at open time via 3\-arg
form of open:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   open($fh,\*(Aq>:crlf :utf8\*(Aq, $path) || ...
.Ve
.Sp
or on already opened handles via extended \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   binmode($fh,\*(Aq:encoding(iso\-8859\-7)\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
The built-in layers are: unix (low level read/write), stdio (as in
previous Perls), perlio (re-implementation of stdio buffering in a
portable manner), crlf (does \s-1CRLF\s0 <=> \*(L"\en\*(R" translation as on Win32,
but available on any platform).  A mmap layer may be available if
platform supports it (mostly Unixes).
.Sp
Layers to be applied by default may be specified via the 'open' pragma.
.Sp
See \*(L"Installation and Configuration Improvements\*(R" for the effects
of PerlIO on your architecture name.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If your platform supports \fIfork()\fR, you can use the list form of \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR
for pipes.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    open KID_PS, "\-|", "ps", "aux" or die $!;
.Ve
.Sp
forks the \fIps\fR\|(1) command (without spawning a shell, as there are more
than three arguments to \fIopen()\fR), and reads its standard output via the
\&\f(CW\*(C`KID_PS\*(C'\fR filehandle.  See perlipc.
.IP "\(bu" 4
File handles can be marked as accepting Perl's internal encoding of Unicode
(\s-1UTF\-8\s0 or UTF-EBCDIC depending on platform) by a pseudo layer \*(L":utf8\*(R" :
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   open($fh,">:utf8","Uni.txt");
.Ve
.Sp
Note for \s-1EBCDIC\s0 users: the pseudo layer \*(L":utf8\*(R" is erroneously named
for you since it's not \s-1UTF\-8\s0 what you will be getting but instead
UTF-EBCDIC.  See perlunicode, utf8, and
http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr16/ for more information.
In future releases this naming may change.  See perluniintro
for more information about \s-1UTF\-8\s0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If your environment variables (\s-1LC_ALL\s0, \s-1LC_CTYPE\s0, \s-1LANG\s0) look like you
want to use \s-1UTF\-8\s0 (any of the variables match \f(CW\*(C`/utf\-?8/i\*(C'\fR), your
\&\s-1STDIN\s0, \s-1STDOUT\s0, \s-1STDERR\s0 handles and the default open layer (see open)
are marked as \s-1UTF\-8\s0.  (This feature, like other new features that
combine Unicode and I/O, work only if you are using PerlIO, but that's
the default.)
.Sp
Note that after this Perl really does assume that everything is \s-1UTF\-8:\s0
for example if some input handle is not, Perl will probably very soon
complain about the input data like this \*(L"Malformed \s-1UTF\-8\s0 ...\*(R" since
any old eight-bit data is not legal \s-1UTF\-8\s0.
.Sp
Note for code authors: if you want to enable your users to use \s-1UTF\-8\s0
as their default encoding  but in your code still have eight-bit I/O streams
(such as images or zip files), you need to explicitly \fIopen()\fR or \fIbinmode()\fR
with \f(CW\*(C`:bytes\*(C'\fR (see \*(L"open\*(R" in perlfunc and \*(L"binmode\*(R" in perlfunc), or you
can just use \f(CW\*(C`binmode(FH)\*(C'\fR (nice for pre\-5.8.0 backward compatibility).

.SS "ithreads"
.IX Subsection "ithreads"
The new interpreter threads (\*(L"ithreads\*(R" for short) implementation of
multithreading, by Arthur Bergman, replaces the old \*(L"5.005 threads\*(R"
implementation.  In the ithreads model any data sharing between
threads must be explicit, as opposed to the model where data sharing
was implicit.  See threads and threads::shared, and
perlthrtut.
.PP
As a part of the ithreads implementation Perl will also use
any necessary and detectable reentrant libc interfaces.
.SS "Restricted Hashes"
.IX Subsection "Restricted Hashes"
A restricted hash is restricted to a certain set of keys, no keys
outside the set can be added.  Also individual keys can be restricted
so that the key cannot be deleted and the value cannot be changed.
No new syntax is involved: the Hash::Util module is the interface.
.SS "Safe Signals"
.IX Subsection "Safe Signals"
Perl used to be fragile in that signals arriving at inopportune moments
could corrupt Perl's internal state.  Now Perl postpones handling of
signals until it's safe (between opcodes).
.PP
This change may have surprising side effects because signals no longer
interrupt Perl instantly.  Perl will now first finish whatever it was
doing, like finishing an internal operation (like \fIsort()\fR) or an
external operation (like an I/O operation), and only then look at any
arrived signals (and before starting the next operation).  No more corrupt
internal state since the current operation is always finished first,
but the signal may take more time to get heard.  Note that breaking
out from potentially blocking operations should still work, though.
.SS "Understanding of Numbers"
.IX Subsection "Understanding of Numbers"
In general a lot of fixing has happened in the area of Perl's
understanding of numbers, both integer and floating point.  Since in
many systems the standard number parsing functions like \f(CW\*(C`strtoul()\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`atof()\*(C'\fR seem to have bugs, Perl tries to work around their
deficiencies.  This results hopefully in more accurate numbers.
.PP
Perl now tries internally to use integer values in numeric conversions
and basic arithmetics (+ \- * /) if the arguments are integers, and
tries also to keep the results stored internally as integers.
This change leads to often slightly faster and always less lossy
arithmetics. (Previously Perl always preferred floating point numbers
in its math.)
.SS "Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings [561]"
.IX Subsection "Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings [561]"
In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what.  The
behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that arrays would interpolate
into strings if the array had been mentioned before the string was
compiled, and otherwise Perl would raise a fatal compile-time error.
In versions 5.000 through 5.003, the error was
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        Literal @example now requires backslash
.Ve
.PP
In versions 5.004_01 through 5.6.0, the error was
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        In string, @example now must be written as \e@example
.Ve
.PP
The idea here was to get people into the habit of writing
\&\f(CW"fred\e@example.com"\fR when they wanted a literal \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR sign, just as
they have always written \f(CW"Give me back my \e$5"\fR when they wanted a
literal \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR sign.
.PP
Starting with 5.6.1, when Perl now sees an \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR sign in a
double-quoted string, it \fIalways\fR attempts to interpolate an array,
regardless of whether or not the array has been used or declared
already.  The fatal error has been downgraded to an optional warning:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        Possible unintended interpolation of @example in string
.Ve
.PP
This warns you that \f(CW"fred@example.com"\fR is going to turn into
\&\f(CW\*(C`fred.com\*(C'\fR if you don't backslash the \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR.
See http://perl.plover.com/at\-error.html for more details
about the history here.

The \f(CW$Config\fR{byteorder} (and corresponding \s-1BYTEORDER\s0 in config.h) was
previously wrong in platforms if sizeof(long) was 4, but sizeof(\s-1IV\s0)

but now it is correctly sizeof(\s-1IV\s0) bytes long, (12345678 or 87654321).

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIsort()\fR has been changed to use primarily mergesort internally as
opposed to the earlier quicksort.  For very small lists this may
result in slightly slower sorting times, but in general the speedup
should be at least 20%.  Additional bonuses are that the worst case
behaviour of \fIsort()\fR is now better (in computer science terms it now
runs in time O(N log N), as opposed to quicksort's Theta(N**2)
worst-case run time behaviour), and that \fIsort()\fR is now stable
(meaning that elements with identical keys will stay ordered as they
were before the sort).  See the \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR pragma for information.
.Sp
The story in more detail: suppose you want to serve yourself a little
slice of Pi.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @digits = ( 3,1,4,1,5,9 );
.Ve
.Sp
A numerical sort of the digits will yield (1,1,3,4,5,9), as expected.
Which \f(CW1\fR comes first is hard to know, since one \f(CW1\fR looks pretty
much like any other.  You can regard this as totally trivial,
or somewhat profound.  However, if you just want to sort the even
digits ahead of the odd ones, then what will
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sort { ($a % 2) <=> ($b % 2) } @digits;
.Ve
.Sp
yield?  The only even digit, \f(CW4\fR, will come first.  But how about
the odd numbers, which all compare equal?  With the quicksort algorithm
used to implement Perl 5.6 and earlier, the order of ties is left up
to the sort.  So, as you add more and more digits of Pi, the order
in which the sorted even and odd digits appear will change.
and, for sufficiently large slices of Pi, the quicksort algorithm
in Perl 5.8 won't return the same results even if reinvoked with the
same input.  The justification for this rests with quicksort's
worst case behavior.  If you run
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   sort { $a <=> $b } ( 1 .. $N , 1 .. $N );
.Ve
.Sp
(something you might approximate if you wanted to merge two sorted
arrays using sort), doubling \f(CW$N\fR doesn't just double the quicksort time,
it \fIquadruples\fR it.  Quicksort has a worst case run time that can
grow like N**2, so-called \fIquadratic\fR behaviour, and it can happen
on patterns that may well arise in normal use.  You won't notice this
for small arrays, but you \fIwill\fR notice it with larger arrays,
and you may not live long enough for the sort to complete on arrays
of a million elements.  So the 5.8 quicksort scrambles large arrays
before sorting them, as a statistical defence against quadratic behaviour.
But that means if you sort the same large array twice, ties may be
broken in different ways.
.Sp
Because of the unpredictability of tie-breaking order, and the quadratic
worst-case behaviour, quicksort was \fIalmost\fR replaced completely with
a stable mergesort.  \fIStable\fR means that ties are broken to preserve
the original order of appearance in the input array.  So
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sort { ($a % 2) <=> ($b % 2) } (3,1,4,1,5,9);
.Ve
.Sp
will yield (4,3,1,1,5,9), guaranteed.  The even and odd numbers
appear in the output in the same order they appeared in the input.
Mergesort has worst case O(N log N) behaviour, the best value
attainable.  And, ironically, this mergesort does particularly
well where quicksort goes quadratic:  mergesort sorts (1..$N, 1..$N)
in O(N) time.  But quicksort was rescued at the last moment because
it is faster than mergesort on certain inputs and platforms.
For example, if you really \fIdon't\fR care about the order of even
and odd digits, quicksort will run in O(N) time; it's very good
at sorting many repetitions of a small number of distinct elements.
The quicksort divide and conquer strategy works well on platforms
with relatively small, very fast, caches.  Eventually, the problem gets
whittled down to one that fits in the cache, from which point it
benefits from the increased memory speed.
.Sp
Quicksort was rescued by implementing a sort pragma to control aspects
of the sort.  The \fBstable\fR subpragma forces stable behaviour,
regardless of algorithm.  The \fB_quicksort\fR and \fB_mergesort\fR
subpragmas are heavy-handed ways to select the underlying implementation.
The leading \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR is a reminder that these subpragmas may not survive

Hashes now use Bob Jenkins \*(L"One-at-a-Time\*(R" hashing key algorithm
( http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html ).  This algorithm is
reasonably fast while producing a much better spread of values than
the old hashing algorithm (originally by Chris Torek, later tweaked by
Ilya Zakharevich).  Hash values output from the algorithm on a hash of
all 3\-char printable \s-1ASCII\s0 keys comes much closer to passing the
\&\s-1DIEHARD\s0 random number generation tests.  According to perlbench, this
change has not affected the overall speed of Perl.

integers even on non\-64\-bit platforms.

Policy.sh policy change: if you are reusing a Policy.sh file

.IP "\(bu" 4
A new optional location for Perl libraries, otherlibdirs, is available.
It can be used for example for vendor add-ons without disturbing Perl's
own library directories.
.IP "\(bu" 4
In many platforms, the vendor-supplied 'cc' is too stripped-down to
build Perl (basically, 'cc' doesn't do \s-1ANSI\s0 C).  If this seems
to be the case and 'cc' does not seem to be the \s-1GNU\s0 C compiler
\&'gcc', an automatic attempt is made to find and use 'gcc' instead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
gcc needs to closely track the operating system release to avoid
build problems. If Configure finds that gcc was built for a different
operating system release than is running, it now gives a clearly visible
warning that there may be trouble ahead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Since Perl 5.8 is not binary-compatible with previous releases

Because PerlIO is now the default on most platforms, \*(L"\-perlio\*(R" doesn't
get appended to the \f(CW$Config\fR{archname} (also known as $^O) anymore.
Instead, if you explicitly choose not to use perlio (Configure command
line option \-Uuseperlio), you will get \*(L"\-stdio\*(R" appended.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Another change related to the architecture name is that \*(L"\-64all\*(R"

The behaviour of non-decimal but numeric string constants such as
\&\*(L"0x23\*(R" was platform-dependent: in some platforms that was seen as 35,
in some as 0, in some as a floating point number (don't ask).  This

.SH "Security Vulnerability Closed [561]"
.IX Header "Security Vulnerability Closed [561]"
(This change was already made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.)
(5.7.0 came out before 5.6.1: the development branch 5.7 released
earlier than the maintenance branch 5.6)
.PP
A potential security vulnerability in the optional suidperl component
of Perl was identified in August 2000.  suidperl is neither built nor
installed by default.  As of November 2001 the only known vulnerable
platform is Linux, most likely all Linux distributions.  \s-1CERT\s0 and
various vendors and distributors have been alerted about the vulnerability.
See http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl\-2000\-08\-05/sperl\-2000\-08\-05.txt
for more information.
.PP
The problem was caused by Perl trying to report a suspected security
exploit attempt using an external program, /bin/mail.  On Linux
platforms the /bin/mail program had an undocumented feature which
when combined with suidperl gave access to a root shell, resulting in
a serious compromise instead of reporting the exploit attempt.  If you
don't have /bin/mail, or if you have 'safe setuid scripts', or if
suidperl is not installed, you are safe.
.PP
The exploit attempt reporting feature has been completely removed from
Perl 5.8.0 (and the maintenance release 5.6.1, and it was removed also
from all the Perl 5.7 releases), so that particular vulnerability
isn't there anymore.  However, further security vulnerabilities are,
unfortunately, always possible.  The suidperl functionality is most
probably going to be removed in Perl 5.10.  In any case, suidperl
should only be used by security experts who know exactly what they are
doing and why they are using suidperl instead of some other solution
such as sudo ( see http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ ).
.SH "New Tests"
.IX Header "New Tests"
Several new tests have been added, especially for the \fIlib\fR and
\&\fIext\fR subsections.  There are now about 69 000 individual tests
(spread over about 700 test scripts), in the regression suite (5.6.1
has about 11 700 tests, in 258 test scripts)  The exact numbers depend
on the platform and Perl configuration used.  Many of the new tests
are of course introduced by the new modules, but still in general Perl
is now more thoroughly tested.
.PP
Because of the large number of tests, running the regression suite
will take considerably longer time than it used to: expect the suite
to take up to 4\-5 times longer to run than in perl 5.6.  On a really
fast machine you can hope to finish the suite in about 6\-8 minutes
(wallclock time).
.PP
The tests are now reported in a different order than in earlier Perls.
(This happens because the test scripts from under t/lib have been moved
to be closer to the library/extension they are testing.)

.SS "Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles"
.IX Subsection "Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles"
Some extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with
`largefiles', a change brought by Perl 5.6.0 in which file offsets
default to 64 bits wide, where supported.  Modules may fail to compile
at all, or they may compile and work incorrectly.  Currently, there
is no good solution for the problem, but Configure now provides
appropriate non-largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs
in the \f(CW%Config\fR hash (e.g., \f(CW$Config\fR{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the
extensions that are having problems can try configuring themselves
without the largefileness.  This is admittedly not a clean solution,
and the solution may not even work at all.  One potential failure is
whether one can (or, if one can, whether it's a good idea to) link
together at all binaries with different ideas about file offsets;
all this is platform-dependent.

A change to self-tying of globs has caused them to be recursively

One can have Unicode in identifier names, but not in package/class or

exist as of Perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than designed; use of
Unicode for the said purposes is unsupported.

One reason of this unfinishedness is its (currently) inherent

In \s-1AIX\s0 4.2, Perl extensions that use \*(C+ functions that use statics

In newer \s-1AIX\s0 releases, this has been solved by linking Perl with
the libC_r library, but unfortunately in \s-1AIX\s0 4.2 the said library
has an obscure bug where the various functions related to time
(such as \fItime()\fR and \fIgettimeofday()\fR) return broken values, and

We suggest upgrading to at least vac version 5.0.1.0, that has been

The failures in dumper.t and downgrade.t are problems in the tests,
those in io_unix and sprintf are problems in the \s-1USS\s0 (\s-1UDP\s0 sockets and
printf formats).  The pat, tr, and fold failures are genuine Perl
problems caused by \s-1EBCDIC\s0 (and in the pat and fold cases, combining
that with Unicode).  The Constant and Embed are probably problems in
the tests (since they test Perl's ability to build extensions, and
that seems to be working reasonably well.)
.SS "Unicode Support on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 Still Spotty"
.IX Subsection "Unicode Support on EBCDIC Still Spotty"
Though mostly working, Unicode support still has problem spots on
\&\s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.  One such known spot are the \f(CW\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eP{}\*(C'\fR
regular expression constructs for code points less than 256: the
\&\f(CW\*(C`pP\*(C'\fR are testing for Unicode code points, not knowing about \s-1EBCDIC\s0.
.SS "Seen In Perl 5.7 But Gone Now"
.IX Subsection "Seen In Perl 5.7 But Gone Now"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Time::Piece\*(C'\fR (previously known as \f(CW\*(C`Time::Object\*(C'\fR) was removed
because it was felt that it didn't have enough value in it to be a
core module.  It is still a useful module, though, and is available
from the \s-1CPAN\s0.

Perl 5.8 unfortunately does not build anymore on AmigaOS; this broke
accidentally at some point.  Since there are not that many Amiga
developers available, we could not get this fixed and tested in time
for 5.8.0.  Perl 5.6.1 still works for AmigaOS (as does the 5.7.2
development release).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO::Scalar\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO::Via\*(C'\fR (capitalised) were renamed as
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO::scalar\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO::via\*(C'\fR (all lowercase) just before 5.8.0.
The main rationale was to have all core PerlIO layers to have all
lowercase names.  The \*(L"plugins\*(R" are named as usual, for example
\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`threads::shared::queue\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`threads::shared::semaphore\*(C'\fR were
renamed as \f(CW\*(C`Thread::Queue\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Thread::Semaphore\*(C'\fR just before 5.8.0.
The main rationale was to have thread modules to obey normal naming,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Thread::\*(C'\fR (the \f(CW\*(C`threads\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`threads::shared\*(C'\fR themselves are
more pragma-like, they affect compile-time, so they stay lowercase).

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://bugs.perl.org/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.com/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the \fBperlbug\fR
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

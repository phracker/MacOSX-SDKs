This document describes differences between the 5.12.0 release and
the 5.12.1 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.10.1, first read
perl5120delta, which describes differences between 5.10.1 and
5.12.0.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.0. If any
incompatibilities with 5.12.0 exist, they are bugs. Please report them.
.SH "Core Enhancements"

Other than the bug fixes listed below, there should be no user-visible
changes to the core language in this release.

We fixed exporting of \f(CW\*(C`is_strict\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`is_lax\*(C'\fR from version.
.Sp
These were being exported with a wrapper that treated them as method
calls, which caused them to fail.  They are just functions, are
documented as such, and should never be subclassed, so this patch
just exports them directly as functions without the wrapper.
.SS "Updated Modules"
.IX Subsection "Updated Modules"
.IP "\(bu" 4
We upgraded \s-1CGI\s0.pm to version 3.49 to incorporate fixes for regressions
introduced in the release we shipped with Perl 5.12.0.

We made a small fix to the \s-1CPANPLUS\s0 test suite to fix an occasional spurious test failure.
.IP "\(bu" 4

We added a missing explanation for a warning about \f(CW\*(C`:=\*(C'\fR to perldiag.pod

We corrected perlmodlib.pod which had unintentionally omitted a number of modules.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We updated the documentation for 'require' in perlfunc.pod relating to putting Perl code in \f(CW@INC\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We reinstated some erroneously-removed documentation about quotemeta in perlfunc.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We fixed an \fIa2p\fR example in perlutil.pod.

We filled in a blank in perlport.pod with the release date of Perl 5.12.

The documentation for Carp.pm incorrectly stated that the \f(CW$Carp::Verbose\fR
variable makes cluck generate stack backtraces.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We fixed a number of typos in Pod::Functions

.SH "Bug Fixes"
.IX Header "Bug Fixes"
.IP "\(bu" 4
A bug in how we process filetest operations could cause a segfault.
Filetests don't always expect an op on the stack, so we now use
TOPs only if we're sure that we're not stat'ing the _ filehandle.
This is indicated by OPf_KIDS (as checked in ck_ftst).
.Sp
See also: <http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=74542>
.IP "\(bu" 4
When deparsing a nextstate op that has both a change of package (relative
to the previous nextstate) and a label, the package declaration is now
emitted first, because it is syntactically impermissible for a label to
prefix a package declaration.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1XSUB\s0.h now correctly redefines fgets under \s-1PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS\s0

We fixed a small bug in \fIlex_stuff_pvn()\fR that caused spurious syntax errors
in an obscure situation.  It happened when stuffing was performed on the
last line of a file and the line ended with a statement that lacked a
terminating semicolon.
.Sp

.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl now builds on \s-1AIX\s0 4.2
.Sp
The changes required work around \s-1AIX\s0 4.2s' lack of support for IPv6,
and limited support for \s-1POSIX\s0 \f(CW\*(C`sigaction()\*(C'\fR.
.SS "FreeBSD 7"
.IX Subsection "FreeBSD 7"
.IP "\(bu" 4
FreeBSD 7 no longer contains \fI/usr/bin/objformat\fR. At build time,
Perl now skips the \fIobjformat\fR check for versions 7 and higher and
assumes \s-1ELF\s0.
.SS "\s-1VMS\s0"
.IX Subsection "VMS"
.IP "\(bu" 4
It's now possible to build extensions on older (pre 7.3\-2) \s-1VMS\s0 systems.
.Sp
\&\s-1DCL\s0 symbol length was limited to 1K up until about seven years or
so ago, but there was no particularly deep reason to prevent those
older systems from configuring and building Perl.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We fixed the previously-broken \f(CW\*(C`\-Uuseperlio\*(C'\fR build on \s-1VMS\s0.
.Sp
We were checking a variable that doesn't exist in the non-default
case of disabling perlio.  Now we only look at it when it exists.
.IP "\(bu" 4
We fixed the \-Uuseperlio command-line option in configure.com.
.Sp
Formerly it only worked if you went through all the questions
interactively and explicitly answered no.

\&\f(CW\*(C`List::Util::first\*(C'\fR misbehaves in the presence of a lexical \f(CW$_\fR
(typically introduced by \f(CW\*(C`my $_\*(C'\fR or implicitly by \f(CW\*(C`given\*(C'\fR). The variable
which gets set for each iteration is the package variable \f(CW$_\fR, not the
lexical \f(CW$_\fR.
.Sp
A similar issue may occur in other modules that provide functions which
take a block as their first argument, like
.Sp
.Vb 1

\&\f(CW\*(C`Module::Load::Conditional\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`version\*(C'\fR have an unfortunate
interaction which can cause \f(CW\*(C`CPANPLUS\*(C'\fR to crash when it encounters
an unparseable version string.  Upgrading to \f(CW\*(C`CPANPLUS\*(C'\fR 0.9004 or
\&\f(CW\*(C`Module::Load::Conditional\*(C'\fR 0.38 from \s-1CPAN\s0 will resolve this issue.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the \fBperlbug\fR
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on \s-1CPAN\s0.

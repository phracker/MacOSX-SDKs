This depends on Metal\&.framework  The logarithmic softmax filter can be achieved by taking the natural logarithm of the the result of the softmax filter\&. The results are often used to construct a loss function to be minimized when training neural networks\&. For each feature channel per pixel in an image in a feature map, the logarithmic softmax filter computes the following: result channel in pixel = pixel(x,y,k)) - ln{sum(exp(pixel(x,y,0)) \&.\&.\&. exp(pixel(x,y,N-1))} where N is the number of feature channels and y = ln{x} satisfies e^y = x\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBClass::Autouse\fR is a runtime class loader that allows you to specify
classes that will only load when a method of that class is called.
.PP
For large classes or class trees that might not be used during the running
of a program, such as Date::Manip, this can save you large amounts of
memory, and decrease the script load time a great deal.
.PP
\&\fBClass::Autouse\fR also provides a number of \*(L"unsafe\*(R" features for runtime
generation of classes and implementation of syntactic sugar. These features
make use of (evil) \s-1UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD\s0 hooking, and are implemented in
this class because these hooks can only be done by a one module, and
Class::Autouse serves as a useful place to centralise this kind of evil :)
.SS "Class, not Module"
.IX Subsection "Class, not Module"
The terminology \*(L"class loading\*(R" instead of \*(L"module loading\*(R" is used
intentionally. Modules will only be loaded if they are acting as a class.
.PP
That is, they will only be loaded during a Class\->method call. If you try
to use a subroutine directly, say with \f(CW\*(C`Class::method()\*(C'\fR, the class will
not be loaded and a fatal error will mostly likely occur.
.PP
This limitation is made to allow more powerfull features in other areas,
because we can focus on just loading the modules, and not have
to deal with importing.
.PP
And really, if you are doing \s-1OO\s0 Perl, you should be avoiding importing
wherever possible.
.SS "Use as a pragma"
.IX Subsection "Use as a pragma"
Class::Autouse can be used as a pragma, specifying a list of classes
to load as the arguments. For example
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use Class::Autouse qw{CGI Data::Manip This::That};
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   use Class::Autouse;
\&   Class::Autouse\->autouse( \*(AqCGI\*(Aq         );
\&   Class::Autouse\->autouse( \*(AqData::Manip\*(Aq );
\&   Class::Autouse\->autouse( \*(AqThis::That\*(Aq  );
.Ve
.SS "Developer Mode"
.IX Subsection "Developer Mode"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Class::Autouse\*(C'\fR features a developer mode. In developer mode, classes
are loaded immediately, just like they would be with a normal 'use'
statement (although the import sub isn't called).
.PP
This allows error checking to be done while developing, at the expense of
a larger memory overhead. Developer mode is turned on either with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`devel\*(C'\fR method, or using :devel in any of the pragma arguments.
For example, this would load \s-1CGI\s0.pm immediately
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Class::Autouse qw{:devel CGI};
.Ve
.PP
While developer mode is roughly equivalent to just using a normal use
command, for a large number of modules it lets you use autoloading
notation, and just comment or uncomment a single line to turn developer
mode on or off. You can leave it on during development, and turn it
off for speed reasons when deploying.
.SS "Recursive Loading"
.IX Subsection "Recursive Loading"
As an alternative to the super loader, the \f(CW\*(C`autouse_recursive\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`load_recursive\*(C'\fR methods can be used to autouse or load an entire tree
of classes.
.PP
For example, the following would give you access to all the \s-1URI\s0
related classes installed on the machine.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Class::Autouse\->autouse_recursive( \*(AqURI\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
Please note that the loadings will only occur down a single branch of the
include path, whichever the top class is located in.
.SS "No-Stat Mode"
.IX Subsection "No-Stat Mode"
For situations where a module exists on a remote disk or another relatively
expensive location, you can call \f(CW\*(C`Class::Autouse\*(C'\fR with the :nostat param
to disable initial file existance checking at hook time.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  # Disable autoload\-time file existance checking
\&  use Class::Autouse qw{:nostat};
.Ve
.SS "Super Loader Mode"
.IX Subsection "Super Loader Mode"
Turning on the \f(CW\*(C`Class::Autouse\*(C'\fR super loader allows you to automatically
load \fB\s-1ANY\s0\fR class without specifying it first. Thus, the following will
work and is completely legal.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Class::Autouse qw{:superloader};
\&
\&    print CGI\->b(\*(AqWow!\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
The super loader can be turned on with either the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Class::Autouse\->\*(C'\fRsuperloader> method, or the \f(CW\*(C`:superloader\*(C'\fR pragma
argument.
.PP
Please note that unlike the normal one-at-a-time autoloading, the
super-loader makes global changes, and so is not completely self-contained.
.PP
It has the potential to cause unintended effects at a distance. If you
encounter unusual behaviour, revert to autousing one-at-a-time, or use
the recursive loading.
.PP
Use of the Super Loader is highly discouraged for widely distributed
public applications or modules unless unavoidable. \fBDo not use\fR just
to be lazy and save a few lines of code.
.SS "Loading with Regular Expressions"
.IX Subsection "Loading with Regular Expressions"
As another alternative to the superloader and recursive loading, a compiled
regular expression (qr//) can be supplied as a loader.  Note that this
loader implements \s-1UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD,\s0 and has the same side effects as the
superloader.
.SS "Registering a Callback for Dynamic Class Creation"
.IX Subsection "Registering a Callback for Dynamic Class Creation"
If none of the above are sufficient, a \s-1CODE\s0 reference can be given
to Class::Autouse.  Any attempt to call a method on a missing class
will launch each registered callback until one returns true.
.PP
Since overriding \s-1UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD\s0 can be done only once in a given
Perl application, this feature allows \s-1UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD\s0 to be shared.
Please use this instead of implementing your own \s-1UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD.\s0
.PP
See the warnings under the \*(L"Super Loader Module\*(R" above which
apply to all of the features which override \s-1UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD.\s0
.PP
It is up to the callback to define the class, the details of which
are beyond the scope of this document.   See the example below for
a quick reference:
.PP
\fICallback Example\fR

.Ve
.SS "sugar"
.IX Subsection "sugar"
This method is provided to support \*(L"syntactic sugar\*(R": allowing the developer
to put things into Perl which do not look like regular Perl.  There are
several ways to do this in Perl.  Strategies which require overriding
\&\s-1UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD\s0 can use this interface instead to share that method
with the superloader, and with class gnerators.
.PP
When Perl is unable to find a subroutine/method, and all of the class loaders
are exhausted, callbacks registered via \fIsugar()\fR are called.  The callbacks
recieve the class name, method name, and parameters of the call.
.PP
If the callback returns nothing, Class::Autouse will continue to iterate through
other callbacks.  The first callback which returns a true value will
end iteration.  That value is expected to be a \s-1CODE\s0 reference which will respond
to the \s-1AUTOLOAD\s0 call.
.PP
Note: The sugar callback(s) will only be fired by \s-1UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD\s0 after all
other attempts at loading the class are done, and after attempts to use regular
\&\s-1AUTOLOAD\s0 to handle the method call.  It is never fired by \fIisa()\fR or \fIcan()\fR.  It
will fire repatedly for the same class.  To generate classes, use the
regular \s-1CODE\s0 ref support in \fIautouse()\fR.

.SS "mod_perl"
.IX Subsection "mod_perl"
The mechanism that \f(CW\*(C`Class::Autouse\*(C'\fR uses is not compatible with mod_perl.
In particular with reloader modules like Apache::Reload. \f(CW\*(C`Class::Autouse\*(C'\fR
detects the presence of mod_perl and acts as normal, but will always load
all classes immediately, equivalent to having developer mode enabled.
.PP
This is actually beneficial, as under mod_perl classes should be preloaded
in the parent mod_perl process anyway, to prevent them having to be loaded
by the Apache child classes. It also saves \s-1HUGE\s0 amounts of memory.
.PP
Note that dynamically generated classes and classes loaded via regex \s-1CANNOT\s0
be pre-loaded automatically before forking child processes.  They will still
be loaded on demand, often in the child process.  See prefork below.
.SS "prefork"
.IX Subsection "prefork"
As with mod_perl, \f(CW\*(C`Class::Autouse\*(C'\fR is compatible with the prefork module,
and all modules specifically autoloaded will be loaded before forking correctly,
when requested by prefork.
.PP
Since modules generated via callback or regex cannot be loaded automatically
by prefork in a generic way, it's advised to use prefork directly to load/generate
classes when using mod_perl.
.SS "Performance Optimizatons"
.IX Subsection "Performance Optimizatons"
.IP ":nostat" 4
.IX Item ":nostat"
Described above, this option is useful when the module in question is on
remote disk.
.IP ":noprebless" 4
.IX Item ":noprebless"
When set, Class::Autouse presumes that objects which are already blessed
have their class loaded.
.Sp
This is true in most cases, but will break if the developer intends to
reconstitute serialized objects from Data::Dumper, FreezeThaw or its
cousins, and has configured Class::Autouse to load the involved classes
just-in-time.
.IP ":staticisa" 4
.IX Item ":staticisa"
When set, presumes that \f(CW@ISA\fR will not change for a class once it is loaded.
The greatest grandparent of a class will be given back the original can/isa
implementations which are faster than those Class::Autouse installs into
\&\s-1UNIVERSAL. \s0 This is a performance tweak useful in most cases, but is left
off by default to prevent obscure bugs.
.SS "The Internal Debugger"
.IX Subsection "The Internal Debugger"
Class::Autouse provides an internal debugger, which can be used to debug
any weird edge cases you might encounter when using it.
.PP
If the \f(CW$Class::Autouse::DEBUG\fR variable is true when \f(CW\*(C`Class::Autouse\*(C'\fR
is first loaded, debugging will be compiled in. This debugging prints
output like the following to \s-1STDOUT.\s0
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    Class::Autouse::autouse_recursive( \*(AqFoo\*(Aq )
\&        Class::Autouse::_recursive( \*(AqFoo\*(Aq, \*(Aqload\*(Aq )

\&            Class::Autouse::_children( \*(AqFoo\*(Aq )
\&            Class::Autouse::load( \*(AqFoo::Bar\*(Aq )
\&                Class::Autouse::_file_exists( \*(AqFoo/Bar.pm\*(Aq )

\&            Class::Autouse::load( \*(AqFoo::More\*(Aq )
\&                etc...

no longer (since 1.20) enable debugging at run-time. This decision was
made to remove a large number of unneeded branching and speed up loading.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.ie n .SS "autouse $class, ..."
.el .SS "autouse \f(CW$class\fP, ..."
.IX Subsection "autouse $class, ..."
The autouse method sets one or more classes to be loaded as required.
.ie n .SS "load $class"
.el .SS "load \f(CW$class\fP"
.IX Subsection "load $class"
The load method loads one or more classes into memory. This is functionally
equivalent to using require to load the class list in, except that load
will detect and remove the autoloading hook from a previously autoused
class, whereas as use effectively ignore the class, and not load it.
.SS "devel"
.IX Subsection "devel"
The devel method sets development mode on (argument of 1) or off
(argument of 0).
.PP
If any classes have previously been autouse'd and not loaded when this
method is called, they will be loaded immediately.
.SS "superloader"
.IX Subsection "superloader"
The superloader method turns on the super loader.
.PP
Please note that once you have turned the superloader on, it cannot be
turned off. This is due to code that might be relying on it being there not
being able to autoload its classes when another piece of code decides
they don't want it any more, and turns the superloader off.
.ie n .SS "class_exists $class"
.el .SS "class_exists \f(CW$class\fP"
.IX Subsection "class_exists $class"
Handy method when doing the sort of jobs that \f(CW\*(C`Class::Autouse\*(C'\fR does. Given
a class name, it will return true if the class can be loaded ( i.e. in \f(CW@INC\fR ),
false if the class can't be loaded, and undef if the class name is invalid.
.PP
Note that this does not actually load the class, just tests to see if it can
be loaded. Loading can still fail. For a more comprehensive set of methods
of this nature, see Class::Inspector.
.ie n .SS "autouse_recursive $class"

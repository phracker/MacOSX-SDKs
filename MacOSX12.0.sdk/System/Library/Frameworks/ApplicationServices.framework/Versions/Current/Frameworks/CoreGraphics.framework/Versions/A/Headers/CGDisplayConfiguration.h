   Display mirroring and display matte generation are implemented either in
   hardware (preferred) or software, at the discretion of the device driver.

   - Hardware mirroring

     With hardware mirroring enabled, all drawing is directed to the primary
     display --- see CGDisplayPrimaryDisplay.

     If the device driver selects hardware matte generation, the display
     bounds and rowbytes values are adjusted to reflect the active drawable
     area.

   - Software mirroring

     In this form of mirroring, identical content is drawn into each display
     in the mirroring set. Applications that use the window system need not
     be concerned about mirroring, as the window system takes care of all
     flushing of window content to the appropriate displays.

     Applications that draw directly to the display, as with display
     capture, must make sure to draw the same content to all mirrored
     displays in a software mirror set. When drawing to software mirrored
     displays using a full screen OpenGL context (not drawing through a
     window), you should create shared OpenGL contexts for each display and
     re-render for each display.

     You can use the function `CGGetActiveDisplayList' to determine which
     displays are active, or drawable. This automatically gives your
     application the correct view of the current displays. */

   A permanent configuration change also becomes the current session's
   configuration.

   Callbacks are invoked when the app is listening for events, on the event

   Callbacks should avoid changing display configurations, and should not
   raise exceptions or perform a non-local return such as calling longjmp().

   Before display reconfiguration, a callback fires to inform applications
   of a configuration change. The callback runs once for each on-line
   display. The flag is set to `kCGDisplayBeginConfigurationFlag'. This
   callback does not carry other per-display information, as details of how
   a reconfiguration affects a particular device rely on device-specific
   behaviors which may not be exposed by a device driver.

   After display reconfiguration, at the time the callback function is
   invoked, all display state reported by CoreGraphics, QuickDraw, and the
   Carbon Display Manager API will be up to date. This callback runs after
   the Carbon Display Manager notification callbacks. The callback runs once
   for each added, removed, and currently on-line display. Note that in the
   case of removed displays, calls into the CoreGraphics API with the
   removed display ID will fail. */

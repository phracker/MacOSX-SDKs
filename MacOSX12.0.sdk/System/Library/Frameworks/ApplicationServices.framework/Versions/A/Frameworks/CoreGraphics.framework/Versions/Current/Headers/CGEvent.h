/* Event taps.

   Taps may be placed at the point where HIDSystem events enter the server,
   at the point where HIDSystem and remote control events enter a session,
   at the point where events have been annotated to flow to a specific
   application, or at the point where events are delivered to the
   application. Taps may be inserted at a specified point at the head of
   pre-existing filters, or appended after any pre-existing filters.

   Taps may be passive event listeners, or active filters. An active filter
   may pass an event through unmodified, modify an event, or discard an
   event. When a tap is registered, it identifies the set of events to be
   observed with a mask, and indicates if it is a passive or active event
   filter. Multiple event type bitmasks may be ORed together.

   Taps may only be placed at `kCGHIDEventTap' by a process running as the
   root user. NULL is returned for other users.

   Taps placed at `kCGHIDEventTap', `kCGSessionEventTap',
   `kCGAnnotatedSessionEventTap', or on a specific process may only receive
   key up and down events if access for assistive devices is enabled
   (Preferences Accessibility panel, Keyboard view) or the caller is enabled
   for assistive device access, as by `AXMakeProcessTrusted'. If the tap is
   not permitted to monitor these events when the tap is created, then the
   appropriate bits in the mask are cleared. If that results in an empty
   mask, then NULL is returned.

   An event tap is represented as a `CFMachPortRef'. The event tap may be
   added to an appropriate run loop by calling `CFRunLoopAddSource'.

   Releasing the CFMachPortRef will release the tap.

   A `CGEventTapProxy' is an opaque reference to state within the client
   application associated with the tap. The tap function may pass this
   reference to other functions, such as the event-posting routines.

   The event tap callback runs from the CFRunLoop to which the tap
   CFMachPort is added as a source. Thread safety is defined by the

/*
 *  TranslationServices
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Translation Services provides tools for conversion of data and
 *    file contents from one format to another. All information for
 *    performing a translation is contained within a TranslationRef.
 *    These include source and destination data types, flags indicating
 *    what type of translation can be performed and references to the
 *    system services which execute the translation. TranslationRefs
 *    are CFTypes which must be released after they are created. Source
 *    and destination formats as well as translation flags can be
 *    queried from the TranslationRef. TranslationRefs are generated
 *    either by requesting a specific translation via TranslationCreate
 *    or during discovery of all possible translations via
 *    TranslationCreateWithSourceArray. It is possible to request
 *    TranslationRefs which perform either data or file conversions or
 *    both by using TranslationFlags. When requesting a translation be
 *    executed via TranslationPerformForData, TranslationPerformForFile
 *    or TranslationPerformForURL it is important for the source and
 *    destination data formats to match those found in the
 *    TranslationRef. 
 *    
 *    It is possible to extend the set of system services which provide
 *    translations by creating what is called a filter service. Filter
 *    services are applications similar to those which provide the
 *    services available in the application menu but with a few
 *    modifications in the application plist. Filter services provide
 *    an "NSFilter" entry instead of "NSMessage". Filter Services must
 *    also provide an array of both "NSSendTypes" and "NSReturnTypes"
 *    containing Uniform Type Identifiers indicating from which formats
 *    a filter services translates to what format. Each filter service
 *    may translate multiple send types into a single return type.
 *    Finally, a filter service must indicate what type of translations
 *    it supports via the "NSSupportsDataTranslation" and
 *    "NSSupportsFileTranslation" entries. In the end, a filter
 *    service's plist may look like the following, 
 *    
 *    
 *    
 *            <key>NSServices</key> 
 *                <array> 
 *                    <dict> 
 *                        <key>NSFilter</key> 
 *                        <string>ExampleTranslation</string> 
 *                        <key>NSReturnTypes</key> 
 *                        <array> 
 *                            <string>com.example.returntype</string> 
 *                        </array> 
 *                        <key>NSSendTypes</key> 
 *                        <array> 
 *                            <string>com.example.sourcetype1</string> 
 *                            <string>com.example.sourcetype2</string> 
 *                        </array> 
 *                        <key>NSSupportsDataTranslation</key> 
 *                        <string></string> 
 *                        <key>NSSupportsFileTranslation</key> 
 *                        <string></string> 
 *                    </dict> 
            <array> 

 *    
 *    
 *    
 *    All filter services must handle the kEventServicePerform Carbon
 *    Event.  The filter service will be automatically launched when
 *    necessary and it will receive the kEventServicePerform event with
 *    the message indicated by the NSFilter tag in the plist as well as
 *    a Pasteboard Manager pasteboard containing flavors indicating
 *    what type of translation must be performed. If a filter service
 *    only supports data translations a flavor on the pasteboard will
 *    correspond to one of the type identifiers listed in your plist's
 *    send types.  Upon translation of the data, the filter service
 *    must clear the pasteboard, add the return identifier and
 *    translated data to the pasteboard, and return from the event. For
 *    a filter service which provides file translations,
 *    "public.file-url" and "com.apple.file-contents-type" will be
 *    available on the pasteboard indicating the file location and
 *    contents format from which to translate. Upon translation, the
 *    filter service should place a "public.file-url" flavor on the
 *    pasteboard indicating where the translated file has been placed,
 *    typically next to the orignal named "<filename> (converted)"
 *    (ala. Finder's "<filename> copy" behavior for duplicated files).

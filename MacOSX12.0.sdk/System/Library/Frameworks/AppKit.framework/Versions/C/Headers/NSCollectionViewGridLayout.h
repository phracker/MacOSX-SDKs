For a horizontally scrolling grid, this value represents the minimum spacing between items in the same column.

/* The largest number of item rows to attempt to fit in the CollectionView's visible area (if enclosed in a ScrollView).  Defaults to 0, which is interpreted to mean there should be no limit other than minimumItemSize.height.

#pragma mark *** Background Appearance ***

/* The colors with which to fill the background.  Defaults to nil.  Setting this to nil causes a default background color to be used.  Setting it to an empty array causes the CollectionView to draw no background fill.  Setting it to a single-NSColor array causes the entire CollectionView to be drawn with the given background fill color.  For CollectionViews using the old, pre-10.11 API: Setting it to an array of (N >= 2) colors causes the CollectionView to use them in sequence, applying color (index % N) behind the item at "index‚Äù.  For new, 10.11-and-later NSCollectionViews, colors after the first are ignored.

/*
 The gravity area describes the area within a StackView that a view will be placed.
 This placement is also highly related to the set orientation and layoutDirection.
 
 Gravity areas will align to a specific direction in the StackView, which are described through these enum values.
 Each gravity area is a distinct portion of the StackView, and the constraints for spacing between gravities is described further in the documentation for the spacing property.
 In addition to the gravity spacing constraints, the center gravity area also has a constraint tying it to the center of the StackView with a layout priority of NSLayoutPriorityDefaultLow.
 
 For horizontally-oriented StackViews, NSStackViewGravityLeading, NSStackViewGravityCenter, and NSStackViewGravityTrailing should be used. Leading and trailing are described by the userInterfaceLayoutDirection of the StackView, (leading = left for NSUserInterfaceLayoutDirectionLeftToRight vs leading = right for NSUserInterfaceLayoutDirectionRightToLeft).
 
 For a vertically-oriented StackView, NSStackViewGravityTop, NSStackViewGravityCenter, and NSStackViewGravityBottom should be used.

 Visibility Priority describes the priority at which a view should be held (aka, not be detached).

 Views will be detached in order (from lowest to highest) of their visibility priority, and reattached in the reverse order (FILO).
 If multiple views share the lowest visibility priority, all those views will be dropped when one needs to be. Likewise, groups of views with equal visibility priorities will wait to be reattached until they can all be readded.

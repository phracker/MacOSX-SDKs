/*!
 @abstract Describes a specific virtual Mac hardware model.
 @discussion
    The Mac hardware model abstracts a set of virtualized hardware elements and configurations.
    A version of macOS may only run on certain hardware models. The host may also only provide certain hardware models
    based on the version of macOS and the underlying hardware.
    Use VZMacHardwareModel.supported to know if a hardware model is supported on the current host.

    Choosing the hardware model starts from a restore image with VZMacOSRestoreImage.
    A restore image describes its supported configuration requirements through VZMacOSRestoreImage.mostFeaturefulSupportedConfiguration.
    A configuration requirements object has a corresponding hardware model that can be used to configure a virtual machine
    that meets the requirements.

    Once the hardware model is obtained, use VZMacPlatformConfiguration.hardwareModel to configure the Mac platform,
    and -[VZMacAuxiliaryStorage initCreatingStorageAtURL:hardwareModel:options:error:] to create its auxiliary storage.
    Once the virtual machine is created, use VZMacOSInstaller to install macOS on it.

    If the virtual machine is preserved on disk, the hardware model used for installation should be preserved for subsequent boots.
    The VZMacHardwareModel.dataRepresentation property provides a unique binary representation that can be serialized.
    The hardware model then can be recreated from the binary representation with -[VZMacHardwareModel initWithDataRepresentation:].

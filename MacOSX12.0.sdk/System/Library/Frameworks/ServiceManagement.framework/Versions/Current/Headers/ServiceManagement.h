/*!
 * @function SMJobBless

 * If the job is already installed, success is returned.
 *
 * In order to use this function the following requirements must be met:
 *
 * 1.	The calling application and target executable tool must both be signed.
 * 
 * 2.	The calling application's Info.plist must include a
 *		"SMPrivilegedExecutables" dictionary of strings. Each string is a
 *		textual representation of a code signing requirement used to determine
 *		whether the application owns the privileged tool once installed (i.e. in
 *		order for subsequent versions to update the installed version).
 *
 *		Each key of SMPrivilegedExecutables is a reverse-DNS label for the helper
 *		tool (must be globally unique).
 *
 * 3.	The helper tool must have an embedded Info.plist containing an 
 *		"SMAuthorizedClients" array of strings. Each string is a textual 
 *		representation of a code signing requirement describing a client which 
 *		is allowed to add and remove the tool.
 *
 * 4.	The helper tool must have an embedded launchd plist. The only required 
 *		key in this plist is the Label key. When the launchd plist is extracted 
 *		and written to disk, the key for ProgramArguments will be set to an 
 *		array of 1 element pointing to a standard location. You cannot specify 
 *		your own Program or ProgramArguments, so do not rely on custom command 
 *		line arguments being passed to your tool. Pass any parameters via IPC.
 *		This plist must be embedded in the __TEXT,__launchd_plist section of the
 *		binary.
 *
 *		A property list may be embedded in an executable at link-time with the
 *		-sectcreate linker flag.
 *
 * 5.	The helper tool must reside in the Contents/Library/LaunchServices 
 *		directory inside the application bundle, and its name must be its 
 *		launchd job label. So if your launchd job label is 
 *		"com.apple.Mail.helper", this must be the name of the tool in your 
 *		application bundle.
 * 
 * @param domain
 * The job's domain. Passing any value other than {@link kSMDomainSystemLaunchd}
 * will result in undefined behavior.
 *
 * @param executableLabel
 * The label of the privileged executable to install. This label must be one of
 * the keys found in the SMPrivilegedExecutables dictionary in the application's
 * Info.plist.
 *
 * @param auth
 * An authorization reference containing the 
 * {@link kSMRightBlessPrivilegedHelper} right.
 *
 * @param outError
 * Upon unsuccessful return, a new CFError object describing the error.  Upon 
 * successful return, this argument is set to NULL.  This argument may be NULL. 
 * It is the responsibility of the application to release the error reference.
 *
 * @result
 * True if the helper tool was successfully bootstrapped, otherwise false.
 *
 * @discussion
 * SMJobBless submits the executable for the given label as a launchd job.  This
 * routine obviates the need for a setuid helper invoked via
 * AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges() in order to install a launchd plist.

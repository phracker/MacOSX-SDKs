/*!	@class			OBEXSession
	@abstract		Object representing an OBEX connection to a remote target.
	@discussion		You will have no need for a obtaining/using a raw OBEXSession, since it requires an underlying
					transport to do anything useful. However, once you have an object that is a subclass of this
					class, you can use the functions herein to manipulate that OBEXSession. First off, you will want
					to use OBEXConnect (if you are a client session) to actually cause the transport to open a
					connection to a remote target and establish an OBEX connection over it. From there you can issue
					more commands based on the responses from a server.
					
					If you are a server session, the first thing you should receive is an OBEXConnect command packet,
					and you will want to issue an OBEXConnectResponse packet, with your reesponse to that command
					(success, denied, bad request, etc.).
					
					You can use the session accessors to access certain information, such as the negotiated max
					packet length.
					
					If you wish to implement your own OBEXSession over a transport such as ethernet, you will need to
					see the end of the file to determine which functions to override, and what to pass to those
					functions.
					
					No timeout mechanism has been implemented so far for an OBEXSessions. If you need timeouts, you
					will need to implement them yourself. This is being explored for a future revision. However, be aware
					that the OBEX Specification does not explicitly require timeouts, so be sure you allow ample time
					for commands to complete, as some devices may be slow when sending large amounts of data.

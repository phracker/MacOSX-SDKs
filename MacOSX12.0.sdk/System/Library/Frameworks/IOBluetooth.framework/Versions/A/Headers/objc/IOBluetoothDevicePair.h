/*!
 	@class		IOBluetoothDevicePair
	@abstract	An instance of IOBluetoothDevicePair represents a pairing attempt to a remote Bluetooth device.
	@discussion	Use the IOBluetoothDevicePair object to attempt to pair with any Bluetooth device. Once -start is invoked
				on it, progress is returned to the delegate via the messages defined below. This object enables you to
				pair with devices within your application without having to use the standard panels provided by the
				IOBluetoothUI framework, allowing you to write custom UI to select devices, and still handle the ability
				to perform device pairings.
				
				Of note is that this object MAY attempt to perform two low-level pairings, depending on the type of device
				you are attempting to pair. This is inconsequential to your code, however, as it occurs automatically and
				does not change the messaging.
				
				Once started, the pairing can be stopped. This will set the delegate to nil and then attempt to disconnect
 				from the device if already connected.

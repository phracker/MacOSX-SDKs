/*
 *  CSBackupSetItemExcluded()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Add or remove an item from the list of items excluded from
 *    backup. When backing up, the backup daemon skips items marked by
 *    this call. If a folder is marked for exclusion, it and its
 *    contents are excluded from backup. When specifying by path, it is
 *    OK to pass  a URL of an item/folder that does not exist yet.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe since version 10.5
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    item:
 *      The URL of the file/folder to be added or removed from the
 *      exclusion list.
 *    
 *    exclude:
 *      true to exclude an item, false to stop excluding it.
 *    
 *    excludeByPath:
 *      false to make the exclusion bit 'sticky', i.e. follow the item
 *      if it gets moved, true to tie the exclusion to an absolute path.
 *  
 *  Availability:
 *    Mac OS X:         in version 10.5 and later in CoreServices.framework
 *    CarbonLib:        not available
 *    Non-Carbon CFM:   not available

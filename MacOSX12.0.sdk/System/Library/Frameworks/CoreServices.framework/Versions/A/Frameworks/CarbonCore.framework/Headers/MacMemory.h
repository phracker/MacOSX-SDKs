 *    The HLock procedure locks the relocatable block to which h is a
 *    handle, preventing it from being moved within its heap zone. If
 *    the block is already locked,HLock does nothing.
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X, the behaviour of the Memory Manager and of heaps in
 *    general is different than on Mac OS 9.x and earlier. In
 *    particular, the heap on Mac OS X is never purged or compacted. 
 *    Therefore, an unlocked handle will never be relocated except as a
 *    result of a direct action by something calling SetHandleSize() or
 *    by using a function like PtrAndHand() which implicitly resizes
 *    the handle to append data to it.  Because of this, most locking
 *    and unlocking of handles is unnecessary on Mac OS X, and the use
 *    of HLock() and other functions is being deprecated.  If you
 *    define a macro named __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__ to 1 in
 *    your sources before you include MacMemory.h, then HLock() and
 *    several other functions will become empty operations, removing
 *    the overhead of a function call.
 *    
 *    However, some applications are relying on the behavior that
 *    resizing a locked handle produces an error, or tracking the state
 *    of the locked bit for a give handle via the HGetState() function.
 *     Applications which rely on this can not use
 *    __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__.

 *    relocatable block without freeing the relocatable blockÕs master

 *    
 *    Note that if there are multiple handles to the relocatable block,

 *    all of the handles share a common master pointer. When you later
 *    use ReallocateHandle to reallocate space for the block, the
 *    master pointer is updated, and all of the handles reference the

/*
 *  HGetState()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Get the current state of the handle's locked, purgeable, and R
 *    bits
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The HGetState function returns a signed byte (char) containing
 *    the flags of the master pointer for the given handle. You can
 *    save this byte, change the state of any of the flags using the
 *    functions described in this section, and then restore their
 *    original states by passing the byte to the HSetState
 *    function.
 *    
 *    You can use bit-manipulation functions on the returned signed
 *    byte to determine the value of a given attribute.
 *    Currently the following bits are used:
 *    kHandleIsResourceBit    - if set, handle is a resource
 *     kHandlePurgeableBit - if set, handle is purgeable
 *     kHandleLockedBit - if set, handle is locked
 *    On Mac OS X and later, heaps are never purged, so the purgeable
 *    bit is used but its setting is essentially ignored. Also, since
 *    heaps are never compacted, and therefore the only time a handle
 *    moves is when that handle is resized, the danger of using
 *    defererenced handles is lower and so handles likely do not need
 *    to be locked as often. Because of this, the state for a handle is
 *    less useful, and HGetState() and other functions is being
 *    deprecated.  If you define a macro named
 *    __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__ in your sources before you
 *    include MacMemory.h, then HGetState() and several other functions
 *    will become empty operations, removing the overhead of a function
 *    call.
 *    
 *    However, some applications may depend on the state bits of a
 *    handle being correct or changing as functions like HLock(), etc.,
 *    are called.  Applications which rely on this can not use
 *    __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__.

 *  HandToHand()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Copies all of the data from one relocatable block to a new
 *    relocatable block.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The HandToHand function attempts to copy the information in the
 *    relocatable block to which theHndl is a handle; if successful,
 *    HandToHand sets theHndlto a handle pointing to the new
 *    relocatable block.
 *    
 *    If successful in creating a new relocatable block, the HandToHand
 *    function does not duplicate the properties of the original block.
 *    The new block is unlocked, unpurgeable, and not a resource. Call
 *    HLock or HPurge to adjust the properties of the new
 *    block.
 *    
 *    To copy only part of a relocatable block into a new relocatable
 *    block, use the PtrToHand function. Before calling PtrToHand, lock
 *    and dereference the handle pointing to the relocatable block you
 *    want to copy.
 *    
 *    Because HandToHand replaces its parameter with the new handle,
 *    you should retain the original parameter value somewhere else,
 *    otherwise you will not be able to access it.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe since version 10.3
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    theHndl:
 *      a handle to the relocatable block whose data HandToHand will
 *      copy.  On return, theHndl contains a handle to a new
 *      relocatable block whose data duplicates the original.

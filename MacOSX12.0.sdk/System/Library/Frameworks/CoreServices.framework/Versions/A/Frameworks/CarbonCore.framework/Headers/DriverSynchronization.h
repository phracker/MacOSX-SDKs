 *  CompareAndSwap()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Compare and swap operation, performed atomically with respect to
 *    all devices that participate in the coherency architecture of the
 *    platform.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The CompareAndSwap function compares the value at the specified
 *    address with oldVal. The value of newValue is written to the
 *    address only if oldValue and the value at the address are equal.
 *    CompareAndSwap returns true if newValue is written to the
 *    address; otherwise, it returns false.
 *    This function guarantees atomicity only with main system memory.
 *    It is specifically unsuitable for use on noncacheable memory such
 *    as that in devices; this function cannot guarantee atomicity, for
 *    example, on memory mapped from a PCI device.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    oldValue:
 *      The value to compare at address.
 *    
 *    newValue:
 *      The value to write to address if oldValue compares true.
 *    
 *    address:
 *      The 4-byte aligned address of the data to update atomically.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    true if newValue was written to the address.

 *  Discussion:
 *    The TestAndClear function clears a single bit in a byte at a

 *    true otherwise.
 *     ------------------------------------------------------------
 *     THIS ROUTINE WAS DOCUMENTED AS RETURNING TRUE IF THE BIT WAS
 *    ALREADY CLEAR AND FALSE OTHERWISE, and on MAC OS 9.x and earlier
 *    it did have this behavior, but on Mac OS X 10.0 and later it has
 *    always returned the state of the bit before the operation ( false
 *    if the bit was clear; true if it was set ).  We have decided that
 *    changing the documentation ( leaving the implementation as is )
 *    is less risky than changing the implementation to match the
 *    documented behavior.
 *     ------------------------------------------------------------

 *    It is specifically unsuitable for use on noncacheable memory such

 *    32-bit decrement operation, performed atomically with respect to
 *    all devices that participate in the coherency architecture of the
 *    platform.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The DecrementAtomic function decrements the value at the
 *    specified address by one and returns the original value. This
 *    function guarantees atomicity only with main system memory. It is
 *    specifically unsuitable for use on noncacheable memory such as
 *    that in devices; this function cannot guarantee atomicity, for
 *    example, on memory mapped from a PCI device.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    address:
 *      The 4-byte aligned address of the value to update atomically.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    The value before the decrement.
 *  
 *  Availability:
 *    Mac OS X:         in version 10.0 and later in CoreServices.framework
 *    CarbonLib:        in CarbonLib 1.0 and later

/*!
 	@class			IOBluetoothPairingController
	@abstract		A NSWindowController subclass to display a window to initiate pairing to other bluetooth devices.
	@discussion		Implementation of a window controller to handle pairing with a bluetooth device.  This
					class will handle connecting to the Bluetooth Daemon for the purposes of searches, and displaying the results.
					When necessary this class will display a sheet asking the user for a PIN code.  This window will not return
					anything to the caller if it is canceled or if pairing occurs.

/*!	@method	pairingController
	@abstract	
	@discussion	Method call to instantiate a new IOBluetoothPairingController object.
	@result		An IOBluetoothPairingController instance.  Call runPanelWithAttributes
        
                        Success - a new instance of the Pairing Controller

/*!
    @method		runModal
	@abstract	Runs the pairing panel in a modal session to allow the user to select a Bluetooth device.
	@discussion	The controller will use the panel attributes to filter what devices the user sees.  The allowed UUIDs
				will be used to validate the selection the user makes.  Only when a selection has been validated (or
				the panel cancelled) and the device paired, will this method return.

				NOTE: This method is only available in Mac OS X 10.2.4 (Bluetooth v1.1) or later.
	@result		Returns kIOBluetoothUISuccess if a successful, validated device selection was made by the user and
				that device successfully paired.
				Returns kIOBluetoothUIUserCanceledErr if the user cancelled the panel.  These return values are the
				same as NSRunStoppedResponse and NSRunAbortedResponse respectively.  They are the standard values
				used in a modal session.

    @method		getResults
	@abstract	Returns an NSArray of the devices that were paired.
	@discussion	There will only be results if the panel has been run, the user has successfully made a selection, that 
				selection has been validated and the selected device paired.  If kIOBluetoothUISuccess was returned for 
				the session, there should be valid results.  Currently only a single device is allowed to be selected, 
				so the results array will only contain one object.  However in the future multiple selection may be supported.

				NOTE: This method is only available in Mac OS X 10.2.4 (Bluetooth v1.1) or later.
	@result		Returns an NSArray of IOBluetoothDevice objects of devices that were paired.  If the user cancelled
				the panel, nil will be returned.

	@discussion	The pairing controller options control the behavior of the panel.  Currently
				kIOBluetoothServiceBrowserControllerOptionsAutoStartInquiry is the only supported option.
				In the future more options will be added to control things like whether the connection to
				the device is closed when the controller is finished or if multiple selection is allowed.

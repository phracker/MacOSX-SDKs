 * @class   IOUSBHostCIEndpointStateMachine
 * @brief   The object representing the state of a user-mode USB host controller endpoint
 * @details This class assists with tracking internal state transitions of a user-mode USB host controller endpoint, and parses IOUSBHostCIMessage command
 *          structures to update state and generate properly formatted command responses.  Clients should create an IOUSBHostCIEndpointStateMachine in
 *          response to an IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeEndpointCreate command, and then use the provided interfaces to identify and process commands,
 *          doorbells, and transfer structures for the endpoint.  The IOUSBHostCIEndpointStateMachine should be destroyed in response to an
 *          IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeEndpointDestroy command.
 *
 *          Endpoint state is controlled by IOUSBHostCIMessage structures representing commands and transfer completions, and IOUSBHostCIDoorbell messages.
 *          Only an endpoint in the IOUSBHostCIEndpointStateActive state may inspect transfer structures, read or modify IO buffers, and generate transfer completions.

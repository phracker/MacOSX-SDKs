 * @class   IOUSBHostCIDeviceStateMachine
 * @brief   The object representing the state of a user-mode USB host controller device
 * @details This class assists with tracking internal state transitions of a user-mode USB host controller device, and parses IOUSBHostCIMessage command
 *          structures to update state and generate properly formatted command responses.  Clients should create an IOUSBHostCIDeviceStateMachine in
 *          response to an IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeDeviceCreate command, and then use the provided interfaces to identify and process commands
 *          for the device.  The IOUSBHostCIDeviceStateMachine should be destroyed in response to an IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeDeviceDestroy command.

    @field  width       The number of visible pixels in a row of an image (excluding padding at the ends of rows)

    @discussion The vImage_Buffer describes a rectangular region within a regular array of pixels. It may describe
                the entire image, or just a sub rectangle of it.  The vImage_Buffer struct is not a complete description
                of an image. Other aspects like pixel format, color space, channel ordering, etc. are generally given
                by the names of functions that operate on the vImage_Buffer or by parameters passed to those functions.
                A vImage_Buffer may contain multiple color channels interleaved with one another, or a single color channel
                (or alpha) as a planar buffer.  vImage_Buffers are often initialized directly by you, by setting fields
                to appropriate values to point to image data you already own. Convenience methods are also available as
                vImageBuffer_Init, vImageBuffer_InitWithCGImage and vImageBuffer_InitWithCVPixelBuffer

     @typedef   vImage_Error 
     @abstract  An error code returned by a vImage function.
     @discussion    All negative values are errors.
                    Positive return values are likely to be the result of kvImageGetTempBufferSize.
                    Zero indicates no error, or quasi-ambiguously a zero temp buffer size, if that
                    flag was passed. Please see the documentation for the function that returned the
                    error code for additional information about the error.
 
    @constant   kvImageNoError      Success.  If kvImageGetTempBufferSize is set in flags, then
                                    it indicates the temp buffer size is 0 and the function did
                                    nothing else.
    @constant   kvImageRoiLargerThanInputBuffer     The size or positioning of the result buffer 
                                    was such that pixels were needed in the source buffer, were
                                    found to be missing and could not be discovered using an edging
                                    process like kvImageEdgeExtend. Typically, this means that the
                                    source image was smaller than the destination image. 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidKernelSize    The size of a kernel was invalid. Typically, kernels have
                                    have an odd number of rows and columns. The kernel might also have
                                    been too large or of zero dimension. Typically only returned by
                                    convolutions and morphological operations.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidEdgeStyle   The edging style {kvImageBackgroundColorFill, kvImageCopyInPlace, kvImageEdgeExtend, kvImageTruncateKernel}
                                    was invalid. Typically, the edging style is either missing or the edging style 
                                    is not supported by this function.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidOffset_X   Some functions take an integer offset in the horizontal dimension. This indicates
                                    how far from the left edge of the vImage_Buffer we shoud consider the origin to be.
                                    The offset allows real pixel data to be used where an edging method like kvImageEdgeExtend
                                    might otherwise have to be used to generate missing pixels. An X offset is essential to
                                    obtaining correct results for tiled image processing when the tile is not at the left
                                    edge of the (whole) image and the function has a kernel or ResamplingFilter.
                                    Typically, this can happen when the offset is negative or larger than the source vImage_Buffer.width.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidOffset_Y   Some functions take an integer offset in the vertical dimension. This indicates
                                    how far from the top edge of the vImage_Buffer we shoud consider the origin to be.
                                    The offset allows real pixel data to be used where an edging method like kvImageEdgeExtend
                                    might otherwise have to be used to generate missing pixels. A Y offset is essential to
                                    obtaining correct results for tiled image processing when the tile is not at the top
                                    edge of the (whole) image and the function has a kernel or ResamplingFilter.
                                    Typically, this can happen when the offset is negative or larger than the source vImage_Buffer.height.
 
    @constant   kvImageMemoryAllocationError    vImage attempted to allocate memory and the allocator failed, returning NULL.
 
    @constant   kvImageNullPointerArgument      One or more arguments to the function are NULL, which are not allowed to be NULL.
                                    Typically, arguments that are not allowed to be NULL are listed in the VIMAGE_NON_NULL() attribute
                                    that follows the function declaration.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidParameter         A function parameter has an invalid value. This is the fallback error code when there is not
                                    an error code that more precisely describes the invalid parameter value such as kvImageNullPointerArgument,
                                    kvImageInvalidEdgeStyle, kvImageInvalidRowBytes, etc.
 
    @constant   kvImageBufferSizeMismatch       This most often occurs when a set of planar buffers are not the same size.  Most often
                                    this occurs when the destination image is planar and the destination planes are not the same size.
                                    It may also occur in rare cases when chunk sizes mismatch for some high level conversions.
 
    @constant   kvImageUnknownFlagsBit      A bit in the flags field is set, which the function does not understand or currently support.
                                    Please check flags enum availability info to make sure the flag is supported on the target OS revision.
 
    @constant   kvImageInternalError    A serious error occured inside vImage, which prevented vImage from continuing. This error is
                                    probably a problem with vImage itself, and not how it is being used. Please file a bug with a
                                    reproducible test case attached, if possible!
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidRowBytes  The vImage_Buffer.rowBytes field is invalid. In some circumstances, rowBytes of 0 is not supported, 
                                    particularly with destination images or when vImage is asked to initialize a vImage_Buffer and the
                                    rowBytes is too small to hold a row of image data.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidImageFormat  Usually a vImage_CGImageFormat or vImageCVImageFormatRef contains an invalid format. It might be a
                                    NULL pointer, a description which is not allowed according to rules of CG or CV image format encodings.
 
    @constant   kvImageColorSyncIsAbsent    ColorSync.framework is completely missing. Certain operations will not work.

                                    A non-NULL invalid CGImageRef or CVPixelBufferRef will result in undefined behavior.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidCVImageFormat A vImageCVImageFormatRef contains an invalid format. It might be a NULL pointer, or an image format
                                    which is not allowed according to rules of CV image format encodings.
 
    @constant   kvImageUnsupportedConversion    Some lower level conversion APIs only support conversion among a sparse matrix of image formats.

 @typedef   vImage_Flags
 @abstract      vImage_Flags is a 32-bit bitfield of options of general use to vImage functions.
 @discussion    Multiple bits may be set concurrently. kvImageUnknownFlagsBit may be returned by
                a function if a flag bit is set (1) but the function does not know what the flag
                bit means (e.g. your new code on an older version of vImage) or if the flag should
                cause a behavior that is unsupported by the function, for example, kvImageHighQualityResampling
                to a function that does not do image resampling.
 @constant  kvImageNoFlags   Use the default behavior. Internal multithreading is enabled. Debug 
                messages are generally not printed to the console. No edging method is specified. 
                Normal quality resampling methods are used (Lanczos3, probably). Do the function,
                instead of returning a temp buffer size. Allocate memory as needed.
 
 @constant  kvImageLeaveAlphaUnchanged   Some functions that operate on ARGB data in place allow
                you to operate on just the RGB components and leave the alpha channel unmodified.
                These are typically histogram and gamma functions.
 
 @constant  kvImageCopyInPlace  One of four edging modes. This one tells vImage to do nothing for
                destination pixels that need source pixels that are missing. The corresponding source
                pixel is copied to the destination image. This is only used for image filters that take a
                kernel, such as convolutions. It is not allowed for Morphology filters.
 
 @constant kvImageBackgroundColorFill  One of four edging modes. This one tells vImage to use the
                backgroundColor parameter of the function as the color of any missing pixels in
                a source image. Missing pixels occur when a filter needs to read off the edge of
                a source image. 
 
 @constant kvImageEdgeExtend    One of four edging modes.  This one tells vImage to use the nearest
                existing source image pixel when it needs source data but finds it needs a non-existant
                pixel off the edge of the provided source image. 
 
 @constant kvImageDoNotTile     Do not internally subdivide the image for processing on multiple CPUs
                or other compute devices. If this flag is set, the function will run single threaded
                on the current thread. Usually this flag may be expected to cause a significant increase
                in the execution time of a vImage function. However, if you are calling the function
                from a heavily multithreaded context (such as your own tiling engine) and CPU occupancy
                is high, this may lead to small performance improvements due to reduced CPU contention.
 
 @constant kvImageHighQualityResampling  Use a more expensive image resampling method than what is available
                by default. Typically this is Lanczos5. Note that as vImage resampling already leans towards
                quality over performance -- the GPU texture unit is your friend if you just want raw performance
                -- the additional quality from kvImageHighQualityResampling may be difficult to see in some images. 
                It is best suited to background rendering tasks.
 
 @constant kvImageTruncateKernel    One of four edging modes. This one tells vImage to use only the pixels it 
                has and reweight the kernel accordingly. The reweighting process can be expensive.  It can 
                also lead to difficulties if a contiguous sub-rectangle of the kernel sums to zero. In this
                case, the area of the kernel is zero and you have formally asked vImage to do division by zero,
                in which case vImage behavior is undefined.
 
 @constant kvImageGetTempBufferSize  Instead of performing the function requested, return (as a vImage_Error)
                the size of the temp buffer requried by the function for this set of parameters. The image pixels
                are not touched. If the function does not take a temp buffer, then 0 will be returned and the 
                function will do nothing. Some functions may return a 0 sized temp buffer for some sets of parameters 
                an not others. The size of the temporary buffer may change for different parameters, and for
                different OS revisions.
 
 @constant kvImagePrintDiagnosticsToConsole Some of the high level functions in vImage_Utilities.h and 
                vImage_CVUtilities.h have complex failure modes that could prove baffling with just a 
                error code return.  This flag instructions these functions to also print a human readable
                diagnostic message to the Apple System Logger when an error is encountered. The output 
                should be visible in Console.app.
 
 @constant kvImageNoAllocate    Some vImage functions may allocate memory, possibly returning it to you.
                This flag instructs the function to use the memory provided instead. For example, instead of
                overwriting vImage_Buffer.data with a newly allocated pointer to memory, use the memory
                pointed to by vImage_Buffer.data directly. In other cases, it may cause the function to
                assume ownership of a buffer, rather than allocating a copy. You are responsible for making
                sure the buffer that you allocate instead of vImage is large enough to hold the image. Most 
                vImage functions do not allocate memory and assume that vImage_Buffer.data is already allocated, 
                and in the case of source image buffers, contain valid pixel data.
 
 @constant kvImageHDRContent    The pixels described in the input image may contain high dymanic range content.
                HDR pixels may have value outside of [-2,2.0]. This flag is generally only applicable to 
                floating-point images. Most 8- and 16-bit pixels can not represent values outside [0,1] and
                functions that operate on 16Q12 formats are designed to operate over the full range of [-8,8).
                Most floating-point functions in vImage are linear in behavior and so work equally well 
                on any float.  Some non-linear functions like polynomials (or by extension colorspace conversion)
                are only valid over a limited range (typically [-2,2]) and will return incorrect answers 
                for values outside that range.  In addition, certain IIR or FFT algorithms in convolution may
                encounter precision issues with HDR content.  For these cases, if you know you have HDR content,
                pass kvImageHDRContent and a (typically slower) alternative method will be used for these
                sources.

    @discussion The vImageConverter is an opaque type which contains information needed to do a rapid conversion from
    one image type to another. Sometimes, it can take a significant amount of time to figure out how to convert
    from one format to another. It wouldn't be good to do that redundantly for a bunch of small images. The
    vImageConversionSetup allows us to set up the conversion once and reuse the information many times, to
    keep net latencies low.
 
    Note that creating a vImageConverter can at times take a while. While usually it is quick, it might have
    to do things like load other frameworks in the system (e.g. Colorsync) if they are not loaded already,
    or build a lookup table. It is a good idea to setup your conversions in advance and reuse the conversion
    objects.  The objects are thread safe. You can use the same object in multiple threads concurrently. They
    follow standard retain / release semantics and can be used as CFTypeRefs.

    @abstract   An opaque type which contains a decription of a conversion from a CoreGraphics image format to a CVPixelBuffer, or the reverse.
 
    @superclass CFTypeRef
    @discussion The vImageCVImageFormatRef describes how the image is encoded in a CVPixelBufferRef. vImage uses this information to construct converters that
    are capable of converting to and from this image encoding.  The format stores a description of the pixels in the image (planar/color representation/
    bit depth/number of channels, etc.) but not the image size, location of the base pointer or rowbytes. It is intended for the vImageCVImageFormatRef
    to be reused for other CVPixelBufferRefs of the same format, such as other frames from the same movie.
 
    vImageCVImageFormatRefs are capable of holding an incomplete encoding representation. You may be required to provide addition information such
    as colorspace and (YCbCr only) chroma siting or conversion matrix before the vImageCVImageFormatRef can be used for image conversion to other
    formats.
 
    The vImageCVImageFormatRef is a CFTypeRef. CFEqual does not test for equivalence of the userData field. You should use vImageCVImageFormat_Retain/Release
    when working with vImageCVImageFormatRef to manage ownership of the object.

        Thread Safety:

            The vImageCVImageFormatRef may be safely read from multiple threads concurrently.  However,
            it makes no attempt to keep its internal state coherent when multiple threads write to it,
            or when one thread writes to it while one or more threads are reading from it at the same
            time. This can be trivially handled by keeping the knowledge of the vImageCVImageFormatRef
            limited to a single thread while it is being created / configured and then treat it as
            immutable thereafter.  If necessary, you can also use a read/write lock to limit reentrant

    number_of_channels  How many  color + alpha channels are encoded in the image. An alpha channel is included in this count
                        if it takes up space in the image, even if its value is described always 1.0, for example by /Last
                        kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipFirst or kCVImageBufferAlphaChannelIsOpaque.  This field is automatically initialized
                        based on the imageFormatType (see above) and is never missing.
 
    channel_names       A list of vImageBufferTypeCodes corresponding to the channels in the image. Unlike what happens for
                        vImageConverterRefs, the type codes used here always encode a single color channel.  vImageConverterRefs
                        use the channel names to encode what is in each vImage_Buffer. Here it is used to describe each channel.
                        So, an ARGB buffer might be described as kvImageBufferTypeCode_CGFormat but will be described as
                        { kvImageBufferTypeCode_RGB_Red, kvImageBufferTypeCode_RGB_Green, kvImageBufferTypeCode_RGB_Blue,
                        kvImageBufferTypeCode_Alpha, kvImageBufferTypeCode_EndOfList }. The order of the channels in the list
                        may not match the order of the channels in the buffer.  This field is automatically initialized based on
                        the imageFormatType (see above) and is never missing.
 
   matrix               (YpCbCr only.)  A YpCbCr image has an associated 3x3 matrix that encodes how it was converted to YpCbCr from
                        a reference RGB colorspace (see colorspace below). The matrix is encoded as a NULL pointer when missing.
                        This field is ignored for non-YpCbCr formats.
 
 
   chroma_siting        Some YpCbCr formats store their chroma components as a smaller image than the luminance component.
                        This describes where the subsampled chroma samples are positioned relative to the luminance component.
                        This field is encoded as a NULL CFStringRef when missing. The field is ignored for RGB, monochrome,
                        indexed and 4:4:4 YpCbCr image formats.
 
   colorspace           For RGB, indexed and grayscale images, this is the colorspace that describes the image encoding.
                        For YpCbCr images, this is the colorspace of the RGB image that you get once the matrix (see above)
                        is unapplied. Thus, the colorspace encodes for the underlying primaries and transfer function of the
                        YpCbCr image. See also vImageCreateRGBColorSpaceWithPrimariesAndTransferFunction.  This field is required
                        for all image formats. A colorspace of NULL indicates a missing colorspace. (This is inconsistent with
                        the shorthand used in vImage_Utilities.h where NULL maps to sRGB.)  Since vImage has no concept of
                        a current graphics device, deviceRGB maps to sRGB and device gray maps to gray 2.2. If you wish to
                        ensure no color correction / conversion, you should match this colorspace with the one in the
                        vImage_CGImageFormat to / from which you are converting.
 
   channel_description  Some CVPixelBuffer formats do not use the entire representable range of the format to encode image data.
                        For example, a 'yuvs' "video range" buffer only uses the range [16,235] for luminance and [16,240] for
                        chroma. Values outside that range are considered to have value equal to the nearest in-range value. In
                        addition, we add additionional fields to leave open the possibility that some formats can encode information
                        outside of the traditional [0,1.0] range ([-1.0,1.0] for chroma) so reference values for the encoding for 0
                        and 1.0 are also described. (See vImageChannelDescription below.) The zero/one fields are analogous in function
                        to the decode arrays provided by CG. It is possible to use the channel description to create formats that are
                        not correctly understood by CoreVideo. These are provided to allow for interoperation with custom video formats.
                        The channel description is initialized automatically for known image format types (see imageFormatType above)
                        and probably only very rarely needs to be changed. It is never missing.
 
  alpha_is_one_hint     Some images are encoded with an alpha channel. However, you may have additional information that the image is
                        really completely opaque. The "alpha is one hint" tells vImage that the alpha channel is always 1.0 (opaque)
                        across the entire image. Setting the hint to 1 may allow vImage to avoid work and run faster in some cases.
                        There is no vImageCVImageFormatRef representation for premultiplied alpha, currently. Since it is a hint,
                        the hint may never be missing from a vImageCVImageFormatRef.  The hint is ignored for image formats that do
                        not contain an alpha channel.
 
  user_data             The vImageCVImageFormatRef has a userData field to allow you to easily reference your data starting from
                        a handle to the object. vImage does  not attempt to interact with the memory pointed to by the userData
                        pointer. It simply holds on to the pointer for you and will call a destructor callback function when the
                        vImageCVImageFormatRef to allow you to free that memory, and do any other post processing needed when the
                        vImageCVImageFormatRef is destroyed. Since there is only one userData pointer, by convention its use is
                        considered private to the application/library/framework that created the vImageCVImageFormatRef, including
                        cases where the creator does not set the userData field. If you need to attach your own data to a
                        vImageCVImageFormatRef created by someone else, you can make  a copy of it or wrap it with your own object.

 Typically, these matrix coefficients come from a conversion of form:
 
 @textblock
    Y' = R_Yp * R + G_Yp * G + B_Yp * B         0 <= Y' <= 1
    Cb = k0 * (B - Y')                          -0.5 <= Cb <= 0.5

 @/textblock
 
 {R_Yp, G_Yp, B_Yp} are typically derived from the perceived brightness for red, green and blue.
 k0 and k1 are typically scaled so that Cb and Cr have the indicated range. Because of these
 relationships, {R_Yp, G_Yp, B_Yp} are usually positive, and B_Cb_R_Cr is usually 0.5.

 @abstract  Range and clamping information for Y'CbCr pixel formats
 @discussion Y'CbCr formats frequently don't use the entire representable range available to 
             them to represent image data. While a "full range" video format does use the
             entire range, a "video range" format often leaves the extrema unused, except perhaps
             to represent values outside of the standard Y'=[0,1] CbCr = [-0.5, 0.5] range. 
             For example, a 8-bit video range format typically uses the range [16,235] for
             Y' and [16, 240] for Cb and Cr. 
 
 
             Some examples:

/******************************************************************************
 *
 * We offer two different techniques for solving AX=B where A is sparse and
 * X, B are dense.
 *
 * DIRECT METHODS:    These perform a factorization of the matrix A, and are the
 *                    most reliable and easiest to use. It is recommended that
 *                    users try these first, and only resort to iterative methods
 *                    if time or memory constraints make these methods infeasible.
 *                    Once a factorization is performed additional solves with the
 *                    same A can be performed cheaply.
 *
 * ITERATIVE METHODS: These apply an iterative numerical algorithm to solve the
 *                    problem. They use less memory than direct methods, and can
 *                    be considerably faster if the problem is numerically well
 *                    conditioned or a good preconditioner is known. To safely
 *                    and correctly use these methods a greater degree of
 *                    mathematial knoweldge and effort is required of the user.
 *                    Subsequent solves require the same amount of computational
 *                    work, unless a good approximate solution is available.
 *                    For the best performance, a problem specific preconditioner
 *                    will need to be supplied by the user.
 *
 * ======================================
 * Direct Methods (Matrix Factorizations)
 * ======================================
 *
 * We offer the factorizations detailed below, but all use the same interface,
 * with the variant specified by the argument `type`. The most basic solution
 * sequence is:
 *   factors = SparseFactor(type, Matrix)
 *   SparseSolve(factors, rhs, soln)
 *   SparseCleanup(factors)
 *
 * It is sometimes required to perform repeated factorizations with the same
 * non-zero pattern but different numerical values. A SparseRefactor() entry
 * point is supplied that allows the reuse of an existing factor object and
 * its associated memory with different numerical values.
 *
 * If multiple different numeric factorizations with the same symbolic pattern
 * are required, or if the user wishes to perform ordering before numeric
 * values are known, a symbolic factorization object can be obtained by passing
 * a SparseMatrixStructure object to SparseFactor() in place of the full
 * SparseMatrix that also includes the numeric values. The underlying object
 * is reference counted, so this object may be safely destroyed by calling
 * SparseOpaqueDestroy() even if numeric factorizations that depend on it are
 * still in use. Due to this reference counting, if the user wishes to make a
 * shallow copy of the underlying object they should call SparseRetain().
 *
 * If the user wishes to apply matrix factors individually, they may obtain
 * opaque objects through the SparseCreateSubfactor() routine. These objects
 * may then be used through calls to SparseMultiply() and SparseSove().
 *
 * Cholesky
 * ========
 * A = PLL'P'
 * for real symmetric or complex Hermitian positive-definite matrices A.
 * If A is not positive-definite the factorization will detect this and fail,
 * potentially after significant computation.
 * P is a permutation matrix that is (by default) automatically calculated by
 * the solver (see options.orderMethod for further details).
 * L is the lower triangular factorization matrix.
 * By default no diagonal scaling matrix is applied to A, but one may be
 * enabled through options.scalingMethod.
 *
 * SparseSolve() will solve Ax = b.
 * SparseCreateSubfactor() allows the following subfactors to be extracted:
 * - SparseSubfactorL    returns an opaque object representing L. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorP    returns an opaque object representing P. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorPLPS returns an opaque object representing PLP'. Only Solve is valid, and
 *                       transpose solve followed by non-transpose solve is equivalent to a full
 *                       system solve with A.
 *
 * Symmetric Indefinite
 * ====================
 * SAS = PLDL'P'
 * for real symmetric or complex Hermitian matrices A.
 * P is a permutation matrix that is (by default) automatically calculated by
 * the solver (see options.orderMethod for further details).
 * S is a diagonal scaling matrix that is (by default) automatically calculated
 * by the solver (see options.scalingMethod for further details).
 * L is a unit lower triangular factorization matrix.
 * D is a block diagonal factorization matrix, with 1x1 and 2x2 diagonal blocks.
 * A variety of different pivoting options are offered:
 * - Unpivoted performs no numerical pivoting, and D only has 1x1 pivots. Only
 *   suitable for well behaved systems with full rank, otherwise very unstable.
 * - Supernode Bunch-Kaufmann (SBK) restricts pivoting to operations that do not
 *   alter the symbolic structure of the factors. Static pivoting (the addition
 *   (of sqrt(eps) to small diagonal entries) is used in the presence of small
 *   pivots. This method is often effective for well scaled matrices, but is
 *   not numerically stable for some systems.
 * - Threshold Partial Pivoting (TPP) is provably numerically stable, but at the
 *   cost of (potentially) increased factor size and number of operations.
 *
 * SparseSolve() will solve Ax = b.
 * SparseCreateSubfactor() allows the following sunfactors to be extracted:
 * - SparseSubfactorL    returns an opaque object representing L. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorD    returns an opaque object representing D. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorP    returns an opaque object representing P. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorS    returns an opaque object representing S. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorPLPS returns an opaque object representing PLP'S. When tranposed represents PLDP'S.
 *                    Only Solve is valid, and transpose solve followed by non-transpose solve is
 *                    equivalent to a full system solve with A.
 *
 * QR
 * ==
 * A = QRP      if m >= n so A is overdetermined or square
 * A = P'R'Q'   if m <  n so A is underdetermined
 * for real or complex matrices A of size m x n.
 * P is a column permutation that is (by default) automatically calculated by
 * the solver (see options.orderMethod for further details).
 * Q is an m x n (or n x m if underdetermined) orthagonal factor matrix.
 * R is an n x n (or m x m if underdetermined) upper triangular factor matrix.
 *
 * If a Cholesky factorization of A^T A is desired (being the factor R) consider
 * using the CholeskyAtA options below instead. This performs the same factorization but
 * without the overhead of storing the Q factor.
 *
 * We note that in many cases other methods of solving a given problem are normally faster
 * than the use of a Sparse QR factorization:
 * - For least squares, use a dedicated least squares solution method
 *   (e.g. Diagonally preconditioned LSMR).
 * - If a low rank approximation is required, multiply rank+5 random vectors by A and
 *   perform a dense QR of the result.
 *
 * SparseSolve() will solve either:
 * - x = arg min_x || Ax - b ||_2      if A is overdetermined.
 * - x = arg min_x || x ||_2 s.t. Ax=b if A is underdetermined.
 * SparseCreateSubfactor() allows the following sunfactors to be extracted:
 * - SparseSubfactorQ  returns an opaque object representing Q. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorR  returns an opaque object representing R. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorP  returns an opaque object representing P. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorRP returns an opaque object representing RP (or P'R'). Only Solve is valid.
 *
 * CholeskyAtA
 * ===========
 * A^TA = P'R'RP
 * for real matrices A.
 * This performs the same factorization as QR above, but avoids storing the Q factor resulting
 * in a significant storage saving. The number of rows in A must be greater than or equal to the
 * number of columns (otherwise A^T A is singular).
 *
 * SparseSolve() will solve A^TA x = b.
 * SparseCreateSubfactor() allows the following subfactors to be extracted:
 * - SparseSubfactorR  returns an opaque object representing R. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorP  returns an opaque object representing P. Both Multiply and Solve are valid.
 * - SparseSubfactorRP returns an opaque object representing RP (or P'R'). Only Solve is valid.
 *
 *
 * =====================================
 * Iterative Methods and Preconditioners
 * =====================================
 *
 * We offer the following iterative methods:
 * CG:    Conjugate Gradient method for symmetric positive-definite matrices.
 * GMRES: Generalised Minimum RESidual method and variants (FGMRES, DQGMRES) for
 *        symmetric indefinite and unsymmetric matrices.
 * LSMR:  Least Squares Minimum Residual method for solving least squares problems.
 *
 * The most basic solution sequence is:
 *
 *   SparseSolve( SparseCG(), X, B, A );
 *
 * However:
 * - Various method-specific options may be passed as the argument of SparseCG(), SparseGMRES()
 *   or SparseLSMR() in the first argument:
 *     SparseSolve( SparseCG( (SparseCGOptions) { .maxIterations=10 } ), X, B, A);
 * - The SparseMatrix argument A may be replaced by a block that applies the operator
 *   Y = Y + op(A) X where op(A) represents the application of the operator A or its transpose:
 *     SparseSolve( SparseLSMR(), X, B,
 *       ^void (enum CBLAS_TRANSPOSE trans, DenseMatrix_Double X, DenseMatrix_Double Y) {
 *         // Code to perform Y += op(A) X
 *       } );
 * - An optional Preconditioner may be supplied. If A is a SparseMatrix, this can be a predefined
 *   preconditioner supplied by the Accelerate library:
 *     SparseSolve( SparseCG(), X, B, SparsePreconditionerDiagonal, A );
 *   or be user specified (i.e. if a better preconditioner is available, or a routine for applying
 *   an operator is supplied by the user instead of a SparseMatrix A):
 *     SparseSolve( SparseCG(), X, B, (SparseOpaquePreconditioner) {
 *         .type  = SparsePreconditionerUser,
 *         .mem   = userDataPointer,
 *         .apply = userFunctionPointer
 *       }, A);
 *
 * If the user requires more control over convergence testing, or otherwise wishes to single-step
 * the method, they may instead perform a single iteration through a call of the form:
 *
 *  SparseIterate( SparseCG(), iteration, state, converged, X, B, R, Preconditioner, ApplyOperator);
 *
 * Users should note that solutions may not be available at all iterations, and a call with
 * iteration=-1 may be required to retrieve the current solution. Refer to the documentation for
 * individual methods before attempting to use this form.
 *
 * Further note that convience forms of this call using SparseMatrix data types and predefined
 * preconditioners are not offered.
 *
 * At present the following preconditioners are offered by this package:
 * SparsePreconditionerDiagonal     - Applies y=D^-1x, where D is the matrix containing only
 *                                    the diagonal elements of A. It provides a simple
 *                                    preconditioner for CG and GMRES methods.
 * SparsePreconditionerDiagScaling  - Applies y=D^-1x, where D is the diagonal matrix such that
 *                                    d_ii = || A_j ||_2 with A_j the j-th column of A. It provides
 *                                    a simple preconditioner for LSMR.

 *  or work required is an NP-complete problem, so only heuristics are implemented in this library.
 *
 *  We note that AMD-based orderings tend to be fast and provide good quality for small matrices,

 *  during the factorization. We recommend AMD is used unless the problem is very large (millions
 *  of rows and columns) or you will perform many repeated factorizations. If you are uncertain,
 *  try both and see which gives better performance for your usage.
 *
 *  The AMD and MeTiS orderings provide good orderings for symmetric matrices. They can be used

 * @discussion
 * Sparse Iterative methods solve Ax=b through an iterative process that only
 * requires multiplication by A or A^T. However, if A is numerically difficult,
 * the iterative process may fail to converge to a solution. Further, even for
 * problems where the process converges, it may do so slowly. Both of these
 * issues can be fixed through the application of a problem-specific
 * preconditioner that cheaply approximates the inverse of A (though good
 * preconditioners are not known for all probelms).
 *
 * More information on iterative methods is available on wikipedia:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method
 *
 * The following book provides a more in-depth treatment of the subject:
 * [1] Y. Saad (2003), "Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems",

 *    Either absolute tolerance (default test) or A tolerance (Fong-Saunders

 *    If negative, rtol is treated as 0.0 (default is not used).
 *
 *  \field btol
 *    b tolerance (Fong-Saunders test only). It should hold an estimate of the
 *    relative error in the data defining the rhs b. For example, if b is
 *    accurate to about 6 digits, set btol = 1.0e-6. If btol is zero, it
 *    is treated as machine epsilon.
 *
 *  \field conditionLimit
 *    Condition number limit (Fong-Saunders test). Iterations will be terminated
 *    if a computed estimate of cond(Abar) exceeds this value. This is intended
 *    to prevent certain small or zero singular values of A or Abar from coming
 *    into effect and causing unwanted growth in the computed solution.
 *    conditionLimit and lambda may be used separately or together to regularize
 *    ill-conditioned systems.
 *    Normally, conlim should be in the range 1000 to 1/eps.
 *    Suggested value:
 *    conlim = 1/(100*eps)  for compatible systems,

 *  Underlying many object in sparse is a private data type references by a
 *  void* component on an opaque type. These are reference counted so that more
 *  than one opaque type can reference the same private object. For example,
 *  SparseCreateSubfactor() increments the refence count of the underlying type
 *  so that the returned SparseOpaqueSubfactor will still be valid even if the
 *  original factorization is destroyed.
 *
 *  Most users do not need to worry about the details of these objects, and
 *  should just ensure that they call SparseCleanup() on any object created
 *  by accelerate once they are done with it.
 *
 *  For advanced users, a SparseRetain() function is provided so they can create
 *  their own copies using the underlying reference counting. Whilst these
 *  functions return a copy, this can be discarded so long as a SparseCleanup()
 *  is invoked in some other fashion to release the reference.                */

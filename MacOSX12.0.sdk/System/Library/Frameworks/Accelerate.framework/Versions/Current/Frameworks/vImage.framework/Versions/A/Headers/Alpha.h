*  @discussion
*  Alpha compositing is the practice of blending one image into another using a coverage component, commonly called
*  alpha, to indicate how opaque each pixel is.  A value of 1.0 (or 255 if an 8-bit image) indicates the
*  pixel is fully opaque. A value of 0 indicates that it is fully transparent. Values in beetween establish a linear scale
*  of partial opacity. Alpha can be used to slowly fade one image into another. Some images such as icons, have opqaue
*  portions and transparent portions. A blending operation based on alpha is required to draw these over a background
*  image.
*
*  In its simplest form, an alpha blend is a linear interpolation between pixel of two images:
* <pre>@textblock
*      float: new color =  top color * alpha + (1-alpha) * bottom color
*      8-bit: new color =  (top color * alpha + (255-alpha) * bottom color + 127) / 255
* @/textblock </pre>
*  However, these formulations are a bit too simplistic because they do not account for the possibility that
*  the bottom layer may have some transparency to it too. One subtlety of adding transparency to the bottom image
*  is that the result image has an alpha component to it too that should be divided out:
* <pre>@textblock
*      float: new alpha =  top alpha + (1-top alpha) * bottom alpha
*      float: new color =  (top color * top alpha + (1- top alpha) * bottom color * bottom alpha ) / new alpha
*
*      8-bit: new alpha =  top alpha + ((255-top alpha) * bottom alpha + 127)/255
*      8-bit: new color =  (255 * top color * top alpha + (255- top alpha) * bottom color * bottom alpha + (255*255)/2) / (255 * 255 * new alpha)
* @/textblock </pre>
* As might be imagined, this extra complication may become costly.  At the cost of a small amount of accuracy in non-opaque regions
* of the image, it is common to leave the alpha multiplied into the image. This avoids the division at the end. In addition,
* if the result is used in another blend, we don't have to multiply the alpha back in at that stage, which simplifies things
* all around. Such images with the alpha channel multiplied into the other channels are called pre-multiplied images.
*
* This gives us the following for premultiplied alpha blends:
* <pre>@textblock
*      float: new alpha               = top alpha +               (1 - top alpha) * bottom alpha
*      float: new premultiplied color = top premultiplied color + (1 - top alpha) * bottom premultiplied color
*
*      8-bit: new alpha               =  top alpha +               ((255 - top alpha) * bottom alpha + 127)/255
*      8-bit: new premultiplied color =  top premultiplied color + ((255 - top alpha) * bottom premultiplied color + 127)/255
* @/textblock </pre>
*
* Some images are known to be fully opaque. For such images, alpha is 1.0 (or 255) for all the pixels, and consequently
* do not require any computation to be done to interconvert between premultiplied and non-premultiplied states. That is,
* since x/1 = x  and x*1 = x, they are non-premultiplied and premultiplied at the same time, and can serve in either
* capacity as needed.  Because of this special status, CoreGraphics labels them kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipFirst/Last. vImage
* does similar things in vImage_Utilities.h. Labelling opaque buffers as such enables cheaper alpha blending and will frequently
* will let us avoid blending all-together as a simple copy operation will do.
*
* This header provides compositing (blending) operations for both premultiplied and non-premultiplied images, functions
* to premultiply or unpremultiply images, and some functions to make sure that the color channel values do not exceed
* the alpha value, which sometimes can happen after a convolution, morphological or resampling operation.
*
*    These alpha compositing functions assume that the floating point range is 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (full intensity color).
*    While values outside these ranges do function correctly (you can have 110% intensity color or -50% color, for example),
*    the calculation is done assuming 1.0 represents full intensity color, and 0.0 represents the absence of color. If these
*    assumptions are not correct, then the calculation will produce incorrect results. Apple does not currently provide
*    alpha compositing functions that work with any floating point range in vImage.
*
*    8 bit functionality assumes that 0 is no color, and 255 is full color. 8 bit functions do saturated clipping before
*    converting from internal precision back to 8 bits to make sure that modulo overflow does not occur. The internal
*  calculation is done with higher precision.

 * @functiongroup Clip To Alpha
 * @discusssion  If a premultiplied image color channel has a value greater than alpha it is super-opaque.  This may
 *               cause problems later in compositing operations. Alpha > color can happen normally as a result of
 *               convolutions, resampling, and morphological operations. While such operations should generally be done
 *               on non-premultiplied content, sometimes premultiplied content slips through. vImage provides a clamping
 *               function vImageClipToAlpha which identify color channels that are greater than alpha and clamp them to be
 *               equal to alpha.

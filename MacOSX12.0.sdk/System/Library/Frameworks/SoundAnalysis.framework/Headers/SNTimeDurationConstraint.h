 @brief Constrains CMTime durations to a subset of legal values.
 @discussion `SNTimeDurationConstraint` is a union type, which, based on the value of its `type` property, may assume one of several forms. Instance properties may be used to extract information from an object, but certain properties are only valid to exercise under certain circumstances. Before accessing a particular property, refer to its documentation to understand what `type` value is required in order for that property to be valid.

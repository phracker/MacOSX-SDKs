	\brief Generate a path component based on a partial filename and a file

	\param contentType The type the resulting file should conform to, e.g.
		\c UTTypePlainText.

	\result A complete file path. Using the argument examples above, this method
		would return a string with a last path component of \c "readme.txt".

	Use this method when you have partial input from a user or other source and
	need to produce a complete filename suitable for that input. For example, if
	you are downloading a file from the Internet and know its MIME type, you can
	use this method to ensure the correct filename extension is applied to the
	URL where you save the file.

	If \a partialName already has a path extension, and that path extension is
	valid for file system objects of type \a contentType, no additional
	extension is appended to the path component before constructing the string.
	For example, if the inputs are \c "puppy.jpg" and \c UTTypeImage
	respectively, then the resulting string will have a last path component of
	\c "puppy.jpg" . On the other hand, if the inputs are \c "puppy.jpg" and
	\c UTTypePlainText respectively, the resulting string will have a last path
	component of \c "puppy.jpg.txt" . If you want to ensure any existing path
	extension is replaced, you can use the \c stringByDeletingPathExtension
	property first.

	If the path component could not be appended, this method returns a copy of

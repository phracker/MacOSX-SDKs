/*! @class IOWorkLoop
 *   @discussion An IOWorkLoop is a thread of control that is intended to be used to provide single threaded access to hardware.  This class has no knowledge of the nature and type of the events that it marshals and forwards.  When a device driver successfully starts (see IOService::start), it is expected to create the event sources it will need to receive events.  Then a work loop is initialized and the events are added to the work loop for monitoring.  In general this set up will be automated by the family superclass of the specific device.
 *  <br><br>
 *       The thread main method walks the event source linked list and messages each one requesting a work check.  At this point each event source is expected to notify its registered owner that the event has occurred.  After each event has been walked and each indicates that another loop isn't required (by setting the 'more' flag to false) the thread will go to sleep on a signaling semaphore.
 *  <br><br>
 *       When an event source is registered with a work loop it is informed of the semaphore to use to wake up the loop.

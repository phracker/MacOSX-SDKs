 *	@function inet_arp_lookup
 *	@discussion This function will check the routing table for a cached
 *		arp entry or trigger an arp query to resolve the ip address to a
 *		link-layer address.
 *
 *		Arp entries are stored in the routing table. This function will
 *		lookup the ip destination in the routing table. If the
 *		destination requires forwarding to a gateway, the route of the
 *		gateway will be looked up. The route entry is inspected to
 *		determine if the link layer destination address is known. If
 *		unknown, the arp generation function for IP attached to the
 *		interface is called to create an arp request packet.
 *	@param interface The interface the packet is being sent on.
 *	@param ip_dest The ip destination of the packet.
 *	@param ll_dest On output, the link-layer destination.
 *	@param ll_dest_len The length of the buffer for ll_dest.
 *	@param hint Any routing hint passed down from the protocol.
 *	@param packet The packet being transmitted.
 *	@result May return an error such as EHOSTDOWN or ENETUNREACH. If
 *		this function returns EJUSTRETURN, the packet has been queued
 *		and will be sent when an arp response is received. If any other
 *		value is returned, the caller is responsible for disposing of
 *		the packet.

 *
 *		This function will lookup the sender in the routing table and
 *		add an arp entry if necessary. Any queued packets waiting for
 *		the arp resolution will also be transmitted.
 *	@param interface The interface the packet was received on.

 *	@param sender_hw The sender hardware address from the arp payload.

 *	@function inet_arp_init_ifaddr
 *	@discussion This function should be called in two places, when an IP
 *		address is added and when the hardware address changes. This
 *		function will setup the ifaddr_t for use with the IP ARP
 *		functions. This function will also trigger the transmission of a
 *		gratuitous ARP packet.
 *
 *		When the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl is handled, the data parameter will
 *		be an ifaddr_t. If this is an IP address, inet_arp_init_ifaddr
 *		should be called. This is usually performed in the protocol
 *		attachment's ioctl handler.
 *
 *		When the event handler for the protocol attachment receives a
 *		KEV_DL_LINK_ADDRESS_CHANGED event, the event handler should call
 *		inet_arp_init_ifaddr for each interface ip address.
 *
 *		For an example, see bsd/net/ether_inet_pr_module.c in xnu.
 *		Search for inet_arp_init_ifaddr.
 *	@param interface The interface the packet was received on.
 *	@param ipaddr The ip interface address.

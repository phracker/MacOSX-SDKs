 * @class IOSharedDataQueue : public IODataQueue
 * @abstract A generic queue designed to pass data both from the kernel to a user process and from a user process to the kernel.
 * @discussion The IOSharedDataQueue class is designed to also allow a user process to queue data to kernel code.  IOSharedDataQueue objects are designed to be used in a single producer / single consumer situation.  As such, there are no locks on the data itself.  Because the kernel enqueue and user-space dequeue methods follow a strict set of guidelines, no locks are necessary to maintain the integrity of the data struct.
 *
 * <br>Each data entry can be variable sized, but the entire size of the queue data region (including overhead for each entry) must be specified up front.
 *
 * <br>In order for the IODataQueue instance to notify the user process that data is available, a notification mach port must be set.  When the queue is empty and a new entry is added, a message is sent to the specified port.
 *
 * <br>In order to make the data queue memory available to a user process, the method getMemoryDescriptor() must be used to get an IOMemoryDescriptor instance that can be mapped into a user process.  Typically, the clientMemoryForType() method on an IOUserClient instance will be used to request the IOMemoryDescriptor and then return it to be mapped into the user process.

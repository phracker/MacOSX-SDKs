/*!
 * @class OSDictionary
 *
 * @abstract
 * OSDictionary provides an associative store using strings for keys.
 *
 * @discussion
 * OSDictionary is a container for Libkern C++ objects
 * (those derived from
 * @link //apple_ref/doc/class/OSMetaClassBase OSMetaClassBase@/link,
 * in particular @link //apple_ref/doc/class/OSObject OSObject@/link).
 * Storage and access are associative, based on string-valued keys
 * (C string, @link //apple_ref/cpp/cl/OSString OSString@/link,
 * or @link //apple_ref/cpp/cl/OSSymbol OSSymbol@/link).
 * When adding an object to an OSDictionary, you provide a string identifier,
 * which can then used to retrieve that object or remove it from the dictionary.
 * Setting an object with a key that already has an associated object
 * replaces the original object.
 *
 * You must generally cast retrieved objects from
 * @link //apple_ref/cpp/cl/OSObject OSObject@/link
 * to the desired class using
 * <code>@link //apple_ref/cpp/macro/OSDynamicCast OSDynamicCast@/link</code>.
 * This macro returns the object cast to the desired class,
 * or <code>NULL</code> if the object isn't derived from that class.
 *
 * When iterating an OSDictionary using
 * @link //apple_ref/doc/class/OSCollectionIterator OSCollectionIterator@/link,
 * the objects returned from
 * <code>@link //apple_ref/doc/function/OSCollectionIterator::getNextObject
 * getNextObject@/link</code>
 * are dictionary keys (not the object values for those keys).
 * You can use the keys to retrieve their associated object values.
 *
 * As with all Libkern collection classes,
 * OSDictionary retains keys and objects added to it,
 * and releases keys and objects removed from it (or replaced).
 * An OSDictionary also grows as necessary to accommodate new key/value pairs,
 * <i>unlike</i> Core Foundation collections (it does not, however, shrink).
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> OSDictionary currently uses a linear search algorithm,
 * and is not designed for high-performance access of many values.
 * It is intended as a simple associative-storage mechanism only.
 *
 * <b>Use Restrictions</b>
 *
 * With very few exceptions in the I/O Kit, all Libkern-based C++
 * classes, functions, and macros are <b>unsafe</b>
 * to use in a primary interrupt context.
 * Consult the I/O Kit documentation related to primary interrupts
 * for more information.
 *
 * OSDictionary provides no concurrency protection;
 * it's up to the usage context to provide any protection necessary.
 * Some portions of the I/O Kit, such as
 * @link //apple_ref/doc/class/IORegistryEntry IORegistryEntry@/link,
 * handle synchronization via defined member functions for setting
 * properties.

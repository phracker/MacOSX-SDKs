 building a new one.

 The system may decide to rebuild its backing store if it got corrupted. The backing store can also
 be rebuilt as a response to the provider calling `-[NSFileProviderManager reimportItemsBelowItemWithIdentifier:completionHandler:]`.
 It is guaranteed that calling reimport on the root item will cause the backing store to be rebuilt,
 but the system can also decide to do so when reimport is called on other items.

 When rebuilding the backing store, the system will invalidate any extension instance associated
 to that domain. As a consequence, the identity of the backing store associated with that domain
 is guaranteed to be stable for the lifetime of the NSFileProviderReplicatedExtension instance.

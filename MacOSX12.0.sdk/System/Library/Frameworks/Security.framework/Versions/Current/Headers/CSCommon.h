/*!
	@typedef SecCodeSignatureFlags
	This is the type of option flags that can be embedded in a code signature
	during signing, and that govern the use of the signature thereafter.
	Some of these flags can be set through the codesign(1) command's --options
	argument; some are set implicitly based on signing circumstances; and all
	can be set with the kSecCodeSignerFlags item of a signing information dictionary.
	
	@constant kSecCodeSignatureHost
	Indicates that the code may act as a host that controls and supervises guest
	code. If this flag is not set in a code signature, the code is never considered
	eligible to be a host, and any attempt to act like one will be ignored or rejected.
	@constant kSecCodeSignatureAdhoc
	The code has been sealed without a signing identity. No identity may be retrieved
	from it, and any code requirement placing restrictions on the signing identity
	will fail. This flag is set by the code signing API and cannot be set explicitly.
	@constant kSecCodeSignatureForceHard
	Implicitly set the "hard" status bit for the code when it starts running.
	This bit indicates that the code prefers to be denied access to a resource
	if gaining such access would cause its invalidation. Since the hard bit is
	sticky, setting this option bit guarantees that the code will always have
	it set.
	@constant kSecCodeSignatureForceKill
	Implicitly set the "kill" status bit for the code when it starts running.
	This bit indicates that the code wishes to be terminated with prejudice if
	it is ever invalidated. Since the kill bit is sticky, setting this option bit
	guarantees that the code will always be dynamically valid, since it will die
	immediately	if it becomes invalid.
	@constant kSecCodeSignatureForceExpiration
	Forces the kSecCSConsiderExpiration flag on all validations of the code.
	@constant kSecCodeSignatureRuntime
	Instructs the kernel to apply runtime hardening policies as required by the
	hardened runtime version
	@constant kSecCodeSignatureLinkerSigned
	The code was automatically signed by the linker. This signature should be
	ignored in any new signing operation.

/*!
	@typedef SecCodeStatus
	The code signing system attaches a set of status flags to each running code.
	These flags are maintained by the code's host, and can be read by anyone.
	A code may change its own flags, a host may change its guests' flags,
	and root may change anyone's flags.	However, these flags are sticky in that
	each can change in only one direction (and never back, for the lifetime of the code).
	Not even root can violate this restriction.

	There are other flags in SecCodeStatus that are not publicly documented.
	Do not rely on them, and do not ever attempt to explicitly set them.

	@constant kSecCodeStatusValid
	Indicates that the code is dynamically valid, i.e. it started correctly
	and has not been invalidated since then. The valid bit can only be cleared.
	
	Warning: This bit is not your one-stop shortcut to determining the validity	of code.
	It represents the dynamic component of the full validity function; if this
	bit is unset, the code is definitely invalid, but the converse is not always true.
	In fact, code hosts may represent the outcome of some delayed static validation work in this bit,
	and thus it strictly represents a blend of (all of) dynamic and (some of) static validity,
	depending on the implementation of the particular host managing the code. You can (only)
	rely that (1) dynamic invalidation will clear this bit; and (2) the combination
	of static validation and dynamic validity (as performed by the SecCodeCheckValidity* APIs)
	will give a correct answer.
	
	@constant kSecCodeStatusHard
	Indicates that the code prefers to be denied access to resources if gaining access
	would invalidate it. This bit can only be set.
	It is undefined whether code that is marked hard and is already invalid will still
	be denied access to a resource that would invalidate it if it were still valid. That is,
	the code may or may not get access to such a resource while being invalid, and that choice
	may appear random.
	
	@constant kSecCodeStatusKill
	Indicates that the code wants to be killed (terminated) if it ever loses its validity.
	This bit can only be set. Code that has the kill flag set will never be dynamically invalid
	(and live). Note however that a change in static validity does not necessarily trigger instant
	death.

	@constant kSecCodeStatusDebugged
	Indicated that code has been debugged by another process that was allowed to do so. The debugger
	causes this to be set when it attachs.

	@constant kSecCodeStatusPlatform
	Indicates the code is platform code, shipping with the operating system and signed by Apple.

	@header SecureDownload
	@abstract Used by clients to implement Apple's Verified Download System.

	          Please note that a succesful check does not guarantee anything about
			  the safety of the file being downloaded. Rather, it simply checks to make sure
			  that the contents of the file being downloaded exactly matches the contents
			  of the file when the ticket was originally generated.

			  To use, do the following:
				1:  Download the secure download ticket.
				2:  Pass the ticket to SecureDownloadCreateWithTicket.  On error, call
					SecureDownloadGetTrustRef to return data that will help you figure
					out why the ticket was bad.
				3:  If SecureDownloadCreateWithTicket returns errSecSuccess, call SecureDownloadCopyURLs
					to return a list of data download locations.  Begin downloading data from
					the first URL in the list.  If that download fails, try downloading from
					the second URL, and so forth.
				4:	Each time you receive data, call SecureDownloadReceivedData.
				5:  Once all data has been received, call SecureDownloadFinished.
				6:  Release the SecureDownloadRef by calling SecureDownloadRelease.

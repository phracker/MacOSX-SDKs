/*!
 *  @class      MPSPredicate
 *  @dependency This depends on Metal.framework
 *  @abstract   A MPSPredicate can be used to run MPS kernels subject to a predicate.
 *  @discussion The MPSPredicate defines a way to refrain running a kernel on the GPU
 *              based on values computed on the GPU. That way one can build control flow operations
 *              that do the decisions on the GPU side mitigating the need to synchronize CPU and GPU
 *              execution. The predicate is used with the version of encode calls that take
 *              a object of type @ref MPSKernelEncodeOptions as a parameter (@see MPSCNNKernel for example).
 *              The code associated with the kernel's encode call is executed on the GPU if and only if
 *              the predicate is considered to be true.
 *              NOTE: It is advisable to release MPSPredicate objects promptly as they take a reference
 *              to a MTLBuffer object and therefore can keep the memory allocated for long periods of time.

/*!     @abstract   Commit work encoded so far and continue with a new underlying command buffer
 *      @discussion This method commits the underlying root MTLCommandBuffer, and makes
 *                  a new one on the same command queue. The MPS heap is moved forward
 *                  to the new command buffer such that temporary objects used by
 *                  the previous command buffer can be still be used with the new one.
 *
 *                  This provides a way to move work already encoded into consideration
 *                  by the Metal back end sooner. For large workloads, e.g. a neural networking graph
 *                  periodically calling -commitAndContinue may allow you to improve CPU / GPU parallelism
 *                  without the substantial memory increases associated with double buffering.
 *                  It will also help decrease overall latency.
 *
 *                  Any Metal schedule or completion callbacks previously attached to this
 *                  object will remain attached to the old command buffer and
 *                  will fire as expected as the old command buffer is scheduled and
 *                  completes. If your application is relying on such callbacks to coordinate
 *                  retain / release of important objects that are needed for work encoded after
 *                  -commitAndContinue, your application should retain these objects before
 *                  calling commitAndContinue, and attach new release callbacks to this
 *                  object with a new completion handler so that they persist through the
 *                  lifetime of the new underlying command buffer. You may do this, for example
 *                  by adding the objects to a mutable array before calling -commitAndContinue, then
 *                  release the mutable array in a new completion callback added after -commitAndContinue.
 *
 *                  Because -commitAndContinue commits the old command buffer then switches to a new one,
 *                  some aspects of command buffer completion may surprise unwary developers. For example,
 *                  -waitUntilCompleted called immediately after -commitAndContinue asks Metal to wait for
 *                  the new command buffer to finish, not the old one. Since the new command buffer presumably
 *                  hasn't been committed yet, it is formally a deadlock, resources may leak and Metal may
 *                  complain. Your application should ether call -commit before -waitUntilCompleted, or
 *                  capture the -rootCommandBuffer from before the call to -commitAndContinue and wait
 *                  on that.  Similarly, your application should be sure to use the appropriate command buffer
 *                  when querying the [MTLCommandBuffer status] property.
 *
 *                  If the underlying MTLCommandBuffer also implements -commitAndContinue, then the message
 *                  will be forwarded to that object instead. In this way, underlying predicate objects and
 *                  other state will be preserved.

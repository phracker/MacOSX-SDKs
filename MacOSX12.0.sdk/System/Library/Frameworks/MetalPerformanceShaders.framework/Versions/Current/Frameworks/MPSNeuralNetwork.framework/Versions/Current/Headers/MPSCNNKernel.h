/*!
 *  @class      MPSCNNKernel
 *  @dependency This depends on Metal.framework
 *  @abstract   Describes a convolution neural network kernel.
 *  @discussion A MPSCNNKernel consumes one MPSImage and produces one MPSImage.
 *
 *              The region overwritten in the destination MPSImage is described
 *              by the clipRect.  The top left corner of the region consumed (ignoring
 *              adjustments for filter size -- e.g. convolution filter size) is given
 *              by the offset. The size of the region consumed is a function of the
 *              clipRect size and any subsampling caused by pixel strides at work,
 *              e.g. MPSCNNPooling.strideInPixelsX/Y.  Where the offset + clipRect
 *              would cause a {x,y} pixel address not in the image to be read, the
 *              edgeMode is used to determine what value to read there.
 *
 *              The Z/depth component of the offset, clipRect.origin and clipRect.size
 *              indexes which images to use. If the MPSImage contains only a single image
 *              then these should be offset.z = 0, clipRect.origin.z = 0
 *              and clipRect.size.depth = 1. If the MPSImage contains multiple images,
 *              clipRect.size.depth refers to number of images to process. Both source
 *              and destination MPSImages must have at least this many images. offset.z
 *              refers to starting source image index. Thus offset.z + clipRect.size.depth must
 *              be <= source.numberOfImages. Similarly, clipRect.origin.z refers to starting
 *              image index in destination. So clipRect.origin.z + clipRect.size.depth must be
 *              <= destination.numberOfImage.
 *
 *              destinationFeatureChannelOffset property can be used to control where the MPSKernel will
 *              start writing in feature channel dimension. For example, if the destination image has
 *              64 channels, and MPSKernel outputs 32 channels, by default channels 0-31 of destination
 *              will be populated by MPSKernel. But if we want this MPSKernel to populate channel 32-63
 *              of the destination, we can set destinationFeatureChannelOffset = 32.
 *              A good example of this is concat (concatenation) operation in Tensor Flow. Suppose
 *              we have a src = w x h x Ni which goes through CNNConvolution_0 which produces
 *              output O0 = w x h x N0 and CNNConvolution_1 which produces output O1 = w x h x N1 followed
 *              by concatenation which produces O = w x h x (N0 + N1). We can achieve this by creating
 *              an MPSImage with dimensions O = w x h x (N0 + N1) and using this as destination of
 *              both convolutions as follows
 *                  CNNConvolution0: destinationFeatureChannelOffset = 0, this will output N0 channels starting at
 *                                   channel 0 of destination thus populating [0,N0-1] channels.
 *                  CNNConvolution1: destinationFeatureChannelOffset = N0, this will output N1 channels starting at
 *                                   channel N0 of destination thus populating [N0,N0+N1-1] channels.
 *
 *
 *              A MPSCNNKernel can be saved to disk / network using NSCoders such as NSKeyedArchiver. 
 *              When decoding, the system default MTLDevice will be chosen unless the NSCoder adopts 
 *              the <MPSDeviceProvider> protocol.  To accomplish this you will likely need to subclass your
 *              unarchiver to add this method.

 *              strip-mine the problem, processing the graph top to bottom on a subset
 *              of the batch at a time, dramatically reducing memory usage. As the full
 *              nominal working set for a graph is often so large that it may not fit
 *              in memory, sub-batching may be required forward progress.
 *
 *              Batch normalization statistics on the other hand must complete the batch
 *              before the statistics may be used to normalize the images in the batch
 *              in the ensuing normalization filter. Consequently, batch normalization statistics
 *              requests the graph insert a batch barrier following it by returning
 *              YES from -appendBatchBarrier. This tells the graph to complete the batch
 *              before any dependent filters can start. Note that the filter itself may
 *              still be subject to sub-batching in its operation. All filters must be able to
 *              function without seeing the entire batch in a single -encode call. Carry
 *              over state that is accumulated across sub-batches is commonly carried in
 *              a shared MPSState containing a MTLBuffer. See -isResultStateReusedAcrossBatch.
 *
 *              Caution: on most supported devices, the working set may be so large
 *              that the graph may be forced to throw away and recalculate most
 *              intermediate images in cases where strip-mining can not occur because
 *              -appendBatchBarrier returns YES. A single batch barrier can commonly
 *              cause a memory size increase and/or performance reduction by many fold
 *              over the entire graph.  Filters of this variety should be avoided.

/*! @abstract   Get a suggested destination image descriptor for a source image
 *  @discussion Your application is certainly free to pass in any destinationImage
 *              it likes to encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImage:destinationImage,
 *              within reason. This is the basic design for iOS 10. This method
 *              is therefore not required.
 *
 *              However, calculating the MPSImage size and MPSCNNKernel properties
 *              for each filter can be tedious and complicated work, so this method
 *              is made available to automate the process. The application may
 *              modify the properties of the descriptor before a MPSImage is made from
 *              it, so long as the choice is sensible for the kernel in question.
 *              Please see individual kernel descriptions for restrictions.
 *
 *              The expected timeline for use is as follows:
 *
 *                1) This method is called:
 *                  a) The default MPS padding calculation is applied. It
 *                     uses the MPSNNPaddingMethod of the .padding property to
 *                     provide a consistent addressing scheme over the graph.
 *                     It creates the MPSImageDescriptor and adjusts the .offset
 *                     property of the MPSNNKernel. When using a MPSNNGraph, the
 *                     padding is set using the MPSNNFilterNode as a proxy.
 *
 *                  b) This method may be overridden by MPSCNNKernel subclass
 *                     to achieve any customization appropriate to the object type.
 *
 *                  c) Source states are then applied in order. These may modify the
 *                     descriptor and may update other object properties. See:
 *                      -destinationImageDescriptorForSourceImages:sourceStates:
 *                       forKernel:suggestedDescriptor:  This is the typical way
 *                      in which MPS may attempt to influence the operation of
 *                      its kernels.
 *
 *                  d) If the .padding property has a custom padding policy method
 *                      of the same name, it is called. Similarly, it may also adjust
 *                      the descriptor and any MPSCNNKernel properties. This is the
 *                      typical way in which your application may attempt to influence
 *                      the operation of the MPS kernels.
 *
 *                2) A result is returned from this method and the caller
 *                     may further adjust the descriptor and kernel properties
 *                     directly.
 *
 *                3) The caller uses the descriptor to make a new MPSImage to
 *                   use as the destination image for the -encode call in step 5.
 *
 *                4) The caller calls -resultStateForSourceImage:sourceStates:destinationImage:
 *                    to make any result states needed for the kernel. If there isn't
 *                    one, it will return nil. A variant is available to return a
 *                    temporary state instead.
 *
 *                5) a -encode method is called to encode the kernel.
 *
 *              The entire process 1-5 is more simply achieved by just calling an -encode...
 *              method that returns a MPSImage out the left hand sid of the method. Simpler
 *              still, use the MPSNNGraph to coordinate the entire process from end to end.
 *              Opportunities to influence the process are of course reduced, as (2) is no longer
 *              possible with either method. Your application may opt to use the five step method
 *              if it requires greater customization as described, or if it would like to estimate
 *              storage in advance based on the sum of MPSImageDescriptors before processing
 *              a graph. Storage estimation is done by using the MPSImageDescriptor to create
 *              a MPSImage (without passing it a texture), and then call -resourceSize. As long
 *              as the MPSImage is not used in an encode call and the .texture property is not
 *              invoked, the underlying MTLTexture is not created.
 *
 *              No destination state or destination image is provided as an argument to this
 *              function because it is expected they will be made / configured after this
 *              is called. This method is expected to auto-configure important object properties
 *              that may be needed in the ensuing destination image and state creation steps.

/*! @abstract   Get a suggested destination image descriptor for a source image
 *  @discussion Your application is certainly free to pass in any destinationImage
 *              it likes to encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImage:destinationImage,
 *              within reason. This is the basic design for iOS 10. This method
 *              is therefore not required.
 *
 *              However, calculating the MPSImage size and MPSCNNBinaryKernel properties
 *              for each filter can be tedious and complicated work, so this method
 *              is made available to automate the process. The application may
 *              modify the properties of the descriptor before a MPSImage is made from
 *              it, so long as the choice is sensible for the kernel in question.
 *              Please see individual kernel descriptions for restrictions.
 *
 *              The expected timeline for use is as follows:
 *
 *                1) This method is called:
 *                  a) The default MPS padding calculation is applied. It
 *                     uses the MPSNNPaddingMethod of the .padding property to
 *                     provide a consistent addressing scheme over the graph.
 *                     It creates the MPSImageDescriptor and adjusts the .offset
 *                     property of the MPSNNKernel. When using a MPSNNGraph, the
 *                     padding is set using the MPSNNFilterNode as a proxy.
 *
 *                  b) This method may be overridden by MPSCNNBinaryKernel subclass
 *                     to achieve any customization appropriate to the object type.
 *
 *                  c) Source states are then applied in order. These may modify the
 *                     descriptor and may update other object properties. See:
 *                      -destinationImageDescriptorForSourceImages:sourceStates:
 *                       forKernel:suggestedDescriptor:  This is the typical way
 *                      in which MPS may attempt to influence the operation of
 *                      its kernels.
 *
 *                  d) If the .padding property has a custom padding policy method
 *                      of the same name, it is called. Similarly, it may also adjust
 *                      the descriptor and any MPSCNNBinaryKernel properties. This is the
 *                      typical way in which your application may attempt to influence
 *                      the operation of the MPS kernels.
 *
 *                2) A result is returned from this method and the caller
 *                     may further adjust the descriptor and kernel properties
 *                     directly.
 *
 *                3) The caller uses the descriptor to make a new MPSImage to
 *                   use as the destination image for the -encode call in step 5.
 *
 *                4) The caller calls -resultStateForSourceImage:sourceStates:destinationImage:
 *                    to make any result states needed for the kernel. If there isn't
 *                    one, it will return nil. A variant is available to return a
 *                    temporary state instead.
 *
 *                5) a -encode method is called to encode the kernel.
 *
 *              The entire process 1-5 is more simply achieved by just calling an -encode...
 *              method that returns a MPSImage out the left hand sid of the method. Simpler
 *              still, use the MPSNNGraph to coordinate the entire process from end to end.
 *              Opportunities to influence the process are of course reduced, as (2) is no longer
 *              possible with either method. Your application may opt to use the five step method
 *              if it requires greater customization as described, or if it would like to estimate
 *              storage in advance based on the sum of MPSImageDescriptors before processing
 *              a graph. Storage estimation is done by using the MPSImageDescriptor to create
 *              a MPSImage (without passing it a texture), and then call -resourceSize. As long
 *              as the MPSImage is not used in an encode call and the .texture property is not
 *              invoked, the underlying MTLTexture is not created.
 *
 *              No destination state or destination image is provided as an argument to this
 *              function because it is expected they will be made / configured after this
 *              is called. This method is expected to auto-configure important object properties
 *              that may be needed in the ensuing destination image and state creation steps.

/*! @class  MPSCNNGradientKernel
 *  @discussion Gradient kernels are the backwards pass of a MPSCNNKernel

 *              These take as arguments the gradient result from the next filter
 *              and the source image for the forward version of the filter.
 *              There is also a MPSNNGradientState passed from MPSCNNKernel
 *              to MPSCNNGradientKernel that contains information about the
 *              MPSCNNKernel parameters at the time it encoded and possibly

 *
 *              In general operation, starting with the input image, the sequence of events is:
 *              1a)  Invoke padding policy to find result size for MPSCNNKernel.  This
 *                   also configures some MPSCNNKernel parameters such as offset.
 *              1b)  Use the MPSImageDescriptor from 1a to make resultImage.
 *              1c)  Call MPSCNNKernel -encode...
 *              2) stages 1a-c are repeated for other forward passes in the inference portion of the graph
 *              3) We estimate the loss resulting from the whole inference computation so far (see MPSCNNLoss.h>
 *              4) stages 5a-c are repeated for corresponding backward gradient passes in the graph
 *              5a) Invoke padding policy on the MPSCNNGradientKernel shown above. This sets the
 *                  MPSCNNGradientKernel parameters to correspond with those in the forward pass
 *              5b) The result gradient for the MPSCNNGradientKernel is created from the MPSImageDescriptor from 5a
 *              5c) Call MPSCNNGradientKernel -encode with the input image, input gradient, result gradient and MPSNNGradientState
 *              6) pass the result gradient on to leftward gradient passes.

 *
 *              For MPSCNNKernels that are trained, there may be other accompanying training kernels that
 *              need to be called in addition to the gradient kernel to update convolution weights or batch
 *              normalization parameters, for example. Steps 1a-c and 5a-c can be combined in a single -encode
 *              call. These return the result image or gradient out the left hand side.
 *
 *              For purposes of inheritance the gradient image is the MPSCNNBinaryKernel primary image
 *              and the source image is the MPSCNNBinaryKernel secondary image. Various secondary properties
 *              such as kernel size are copies of the forward inference pass parameters of similar name

 *              operate correctly with partial batches. This allows the graph to
 *              strip-mine the problem, processing the graph top to bottom on a subset
 *              of the batch at a time, dramatically reducing memory usage. As the full
 *              nominal working set for a graph is often so large that it may not fit
 *              in memory, sub-batching may be required forward progress.
 *
 *              Batch normalization statistics on the other hand must complete the batch
 *              before the statistics may be used to normalize the images in the batch
 *              in the ensuing normalization filter. Consequently, batch normalization statistics
 *              requests the graph insert a batch barrier following it by returning
 *              YES from -appendBatchBarrier. This tells the graph to complete the batch
 *              before any dependent filters can start. Note that the filter itself may
 *              still be subject to sub-batching in its operation. All filters must be able to
 *              function without seeing the entire batch in a single -encode call. Carry
 *              over state that is accumulated across sub-batches is commonly carried in
 *              a shared MPSState containing a MTLBuffer. See -isResultStateReusedAcrossBatch.
 *
 *              Caution: on most supported devices, the working set may be so large
 *              that the graph may be forced to throw away and recalculate most
 *              intermediate images in cases where strip-mining can not occur because
 *              -appendBatchBarrier returns YES. A single batch barrier can commonly
 *              cause a memory size increase and/or performance reduction by many fold
 *              over the entire graph.  Filters of this variety should be avoided.

/*! @abstract   Get a suggested destination image descriptor for a source image
 *  @discussion Your application is certainly free to pass in any destinationImage
 *              it likes to encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImage:destinationImage,
 *              within reason. This is the basic design for iOS 10. This method
 *              is therefore not required.
 *
 *              However, calculating the MPSImage size and MPSCNNKernel properties
 *              for each filter can be tedious and complicated work, so this method
 *              is made available to automate the process. The application may
 *              modify the properties of the descriptor before a MPSImage is made from
 *              it, so long as the choice is sensible for the kernel in question.
 *              Please see individual kernel descriptions for restrictions.
 *
 *              The expected timeline for use is as follows:
 *
 *                1) This method is called:
 *                  a) The default MPS padding calculation is applied. It
 *                     uses the MPSNNPaddingMethod of the .padding property to
 *                     provide a consistent addressing scheme over the graph.
 *                     It creates the MPSImageDescriptor and adjusts the .offset
 *                     property of the MPSNNKernel. When using a MPSNNGraph, the
 *                     padding is set using the MPSNNFilterNode as a proxy.
 *
 *                  b) This method may be overridden by MPSCNNKernel subclass
 *                     to achieve any customization appropriate to the object type.
 *
 *                  c) Source states are then applied in order. These may modify the
 *                     descriptor and may update other object properties. See:
 *                      -destinationImageDescriptorForSourceImages:sourceStates:
 *                       forKernel:suggestedDescriptor:  This is the typical way
 *                      in which MPS may attempt to influence the operation of
 *                      its kernels.
 *
 *                  d) If the .padding property has a custom padding policy method
 *                      of the same name, it is called. Similarly, it may also adjust
 *                      the descriptor and any MPSCNNKernel properties. This is the
 *                      typical way in which your application may attempt to influence
 *                      the operation of the MPS kernels.
 *
 *                2) A result is returned from this method and the caller
 *                     may further adjust the descriptor and kernel properties
 *                     directly.
 *
 *                3) The caller uses the descriptor to make a new MPSImage to
 *                   use as the destination image for the -encode call in step 5.
 *
 *                4) The caller calls -resultStateForSourceImage:sourceStates:destinationImage:
 *                    to make any result states needed for the kernel. If there isn't
 *                    one, it will return nil. A variant is available to return a
 *                    temporary state instead.
 *
 *                5) a -encode method is called to encode the kernel.
 *
 *              The entire process 1-5 is more simply achieved by just calling an -encode...
 *              method that returns a MPSImage out the left hand sid of the method. Simpler
 *              still, use the MPSNNGraph to coordinate the entire process from end to end.
 *              Opportunities to influence the process are of course reduced, as (2) is no longer
 *              possible with either method. Your application may opt to use the five step method
 *              if it requires greater customization as described, or if it would like to estimate
 *              storage in advance based on the sum of MPSImageDescriptors before processing
 *              a graph. Storage estimation is done by using the MPSImageDescriptor to create
 *              a MPSImage (without passing it a texture), and then call -resourceSize. As long
 *              as the MPSImage is not used in an encode call and the .texture property is not
 *              invoked, the underlying MTLTexture is not created.
 *
 *              No destination state or destination image is provided as an argument to this
 *              function because it is expected they will be made / configured after this
 *              is called. This method is expected to auto-configure important object properties
 *              that may be needed in the ensuing destination image and state creation steps.
 *
 *  @param      sourceImages    A array of source images that will be passed into the -encode call
 *                              Since MPSCNNKernel is a unary kernel, it is an array of length 1.
 *  @param      sourceStates    An optional array of source states that will be passed into the -encode call
 *  @return     an image descriptor allocated on the autorelease pool

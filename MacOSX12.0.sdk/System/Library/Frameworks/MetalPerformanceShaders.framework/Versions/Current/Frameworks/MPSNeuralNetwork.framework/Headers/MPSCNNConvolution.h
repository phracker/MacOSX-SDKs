/*!
 *  @abstract   Adds batch normalization for inference, it copies all the float arrays provided, expecting 
 *              outputFeatureChannels elements in each.
 *
 *  @discussion This method will be used to pass in batch normalization parameters to the convolution during the
 *              init call. For inference we modify weights and bias going in convolution or Fully Connected layer to combine
 *              and optimize the layers.
 *
 *
 *              w: weights for a corresponding output feature channel
 *              b: bias for a corresponding output feature channel
 *              W: batch normalized weights for a corresponding output feature channel
 *              B: batch normalized bias for a corresponding output feature channel
 *
 *
 *              I = gamma / sqrt(variance + epsilon), J = beta - ( I * mean )
 *
 *              W = w * I
 *              B = b * I + J
 *
 *              Every convolution has (OutputFeatureChannel * kernelWidth * kernelHeight * InputFeatureChannel) weights
 *
 *              I, J are calculated, for every output feature channel separately to get the corresponding weights and bias
 *              Thus, I, J are calculated and then used for every (kernelWidth * kernelHeight * InputFeatureChannel)
 *              weights, and this is done OutputFeatureChannel number of times for each output channel.
 *
 *              thus, internally, batch normalized weights are computed as:
 *
 *              W[no][i][j][ni] = w[no][i][j][ni] * I[no]
 *
 *              no: index into outputFeatureChannel
 *              i : index into kernel Height
 *              j : index into kernel Width
 *              ni: index into inputFeatureChannel
 *
 *              One usually doesn't see a bias term and batch normalization together as batch normalization potentially cancels
 *              out the bias term after training, but in MPS if the user provides it, batch normalization will use the above 
 *              formula to incorporate it, if user does not have bias terms then put a float array of zeroes in the convolution
 *              init for bias terms of each output feature channel.
 *
 *
 *              this comes from:
 *              https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167v3.pdf

 *  @class      MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState
 *  @discussion The MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState is returned by resultStateForSourceImage:sourceStates method on MPSCNNConvolution object.
 *              Note that resultStateForSourceImage:sourceStates:destinationImage creates the object on autoreleasepool.
 *              It will be consumed by MPSCNNConvolutionGradient. This is also used by MPSCNNConvolutionTranspose encode call
 *              that returns MPSImage on left hand side to correctly size the destination.
 *              Note that state objects are not usable across batches i.e. when batch is done you should nuke the state object and create
 *              new one for next batch.
 *
 *              This state exposes the gradient with respect to weights and biases, as computed by the MPSCNNConvolutionGradient kernel, as a metal buffer to be used
 *              during weights and biases update. The standard weights and biases update formula is:
 *
 *                        weights(t+1) = f(weights(t), gradientForWeights(t)) and
 *                        biases(t+1) = f(biases(t), gradientForBiases(t)),
 *
 *              where the weights(t)/biases(t) are the wegihts and the biases at step t that are provided by data source provider used to create MPSCNNConvolution and
 *              MPSCNNConvoltuionGradient objects. There are multiple ways user can update weights and biases as described below:
 *
 *              1) For check pointing, i.e. updating weights/biases and storing:
 *                   once the command buffer on which MPSCNNConvolutionGradient is enqueued is done (e.g. in command
 *                 buffer completion callback), the application can simply use
 *                                    float* delta_w = (float*)((char*)[gradientForWeights contents]);
 *                                    float* delta_b = (float*)((char*)[gradientForBiases contents]);
 *                  to update the weights and biases in the data provider directly.
 *                  The application can instead provide a metal kernel that reads from gradientForWeights and gradientForBiases buffer and the buffer created using data provided by the data source
 *                  to do any kind of update it will like to do, then read back the updated weights/biases and store to the data source. Note that lifetime of the
 *                  gradientForWeights and gradientForBiases buffer is the same as the MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState. So it's the applications's responsibility to make sure the buffer is alive
 *                  (retained) when the update kernel is running if the command buffer doesn't retain the buffer. Also, in order to gaurantee that the buffer is correctly
 *                  synchronized for CPU side access, it is the application's responsibility to call
 *                                     [gradientState synchronizeOnCommandBuffer:]
 *                  before accessing data from the buffer.
 *
 *              2) For a CPU side update, once the weights and biases in the data source provider are updated as above, the original MPSCNNConvolution and
 *                 MPSCNNConvolutionGradient objects need to be updated with the new weigths and biases by calling the
 *                       -(void) reloadWeightsAndBiasesFromDataSource
 *                 method. Again application needs to call [gradientState synchronizeOnCommandBuffer:] before touching data on CPU side.
 *
 *              3) The above CPU side update requires command buffer to be done. If the application doesn't want to update its data source provider object and would prefer to directly
 *                 enqueue an update of the internal MPSCNNConvolution and MPSCNNConvolutionGradient weights/biases buffers on the GPU without CPU side involvement, it needs to do
 *                 following:
 *                     i) get gradientForWeights and gradientForBiases buffers from this gradient state object and set it as source of update kernel
 *                    ii) create a temporary buffer, dest, of same size and set it as destination of update kernel
 *                   iii) enqueue update kernel on command buffer
 *                    iv) call reloadWeightsAndBiasesWithCommandBuffer:dest:weightsOffset:biasesOffset on MPSCNNConvolution and MPSCNNConvolutionGradient objects. This
 *                        will reload the weights from application's update kernel in dest on GPU without CPU side involvement.

 *  @discussion The MPSCNNConvolutionGradient implementents backward propagation of gradient i.e. it computes the gradient of loss function
 *              with respect input data of corresonding forward convolution and gradient of loss function with respect to weights and bias
 *              of corresponding convolution in forward pass.
 *
 *              Gradient with respect to data
 *              ==============================
 *              Gradient with respect to input data of corresponding forward convolution will be written in destination image passed to
 *              encode call of MPSCNNConvolutionGradient.
 *              This step is similar to convolution transpose in that the strided convolution in forward pass become zero filled convolution in
 *              backward propagation of gradients. The difference between MPSCNNConvolutionTranspose and gradient wrt data is how the
 *              weights, that are provided by data source, are interpreted. MPSCNNConvolution and MPSCNNConvolutionTranspose interpret weights
 *              provided by data source as
 *                                          weights[outputFeatureChannels][kernelWidth][kernelHeight][inputFeatureChannels]
 *              whereas convoution gradient with respect to data interpret the weights as
 *                                          weights[inputFeatureChannels][kernelWidth][kernelHeight][outputFeatureChannels]
 *              i.e. weights are transposed in inputFeatureChannels/outputFeatureChannels dimension and also rotated 180 degress in spatial dimension
 *
 *              User should use the same data source provider to initialize MPSCNNConvolutionGradient as is used to initialize corresponding
 *              forward MPSCNNConvolution. Implementation will do the transposition/shuffling needed.
 *              Thus, while the forward MPSCNNConvolution takes sourceImage of inputFeatureChannels and convolves it with
 *              Wt[outputFeatureChannels][kernelHeight][kernelWidth][inputFeatureChannels] to produce destinationImage of outputFeatureChannels,
 *              MPSConvolutionGradient takes sourceGradient of outputFeatureChannels which is out of previous layer (nomally neuron backward layer),
 *              convolves it with transposed and rotated weights and produces destinationGradient of inputFeatureChannels.
 *              If the user decide to double buffer data source provider i.e. different data source providers are passed to forward MPSCNNConvolution object and
 *              corresponding MPSCNNConvolutionGradient object, it is user responsibility to make sure both data source providers provide same weights/bias data
 *              and have same properties in convolution descriptor else behavior is undefined.
 *
 *              Gradient with respect to weights and bias
 *              =========================================
 *              Gradient with respect to weights and bias are returned in MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState object to be used in weights update functions.
 *              If I denotes the input image to corresponding MPSCNNConvolution in forward pass and E denoates the loss gradient from previous layer
 *              (normally neuron backward layer) in backward pass, gradient of E with respect to weights is
 *
 *              delta_E/delta_Wkpqc = sum_i sum_j [ E(i, j, k) * I( secondaryStrideInPixelX*i + secondaryOffset.x + secondaryDilationRateX*p,
 *                                                                  secondaryStrideinPixelY*i + secondaryOffset.y + secondaryDilationRateY*q, c) ]
 *
 *              where i goes over 0..W-1 and j goes over 0..H-1, (W,H) being width and height of E.
 *              p in [0, secondaryKernelWidth-1]
 *              q in [0, secondaryKernelHeight-1]
 *              c in [0, inputeFeatureChannels/groups - 1]
 *              k in [0, outputFeatureChannels]
 *
 *              and gradient with respect to bias
 *
 *              delta_E/delta_bk = sum_i sum_j [ E(i, j, k) ]
 *
 *              These gradients with respect to weights and bias are returned as buffers in MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState object passed in the encode call.
 *              These are consumed by MPSCNNConvolution object's -updateWeightsAndBias:MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState* method for CPU side update and
 *              encodeWeightsAndBiasUpdate:commandBuffer:MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState* method of MPSCNNConvolution object for GPU side update.
 *              UPdated weights and biases are computed as
 *
 *                         Wkpqc_new = Wkpqc_old + delta_E/delta_Wkpqc
 *                         bk_new = bk_old + delta_E/delta_bk
 *
 *              Note that MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState objects's buffers that contain gradients, for CPU side update, will only contain
 *              valid data after command buffer is complete so
 *              its only makes sense to call -updateWeightsAndBias method on MPSCNNConvolution objects after command bufer is
 *              complete. One can achieve this by enqueueing a command buffer completion handler block that make this call.
 *              Since MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState is used across command buffers i.e. its created in forward pass, consumed by  MPSCNNConvolutionGradient in backward pass in same command buffer and passed onto MPSCNNConvolution updateWeightsAndBias method
 *              after completion of command buffer, it cannot be a temporary state.
 *
 *              In order to gaurantee consistency between forward pass (MPSCNNConvolution) and weights gradient computation in this filter, certain requirements
 *              must be met.
 *              1) Dimensions of loss gradient E from previous layer in backward pass must be equal to clipRect.size of corresponding MPSCNNConvolution in forward pass.
 *                 This is to gaurantee that only those pixels for which weights/bias contributed in destination of forward pass end up contributing to weights/bias gradient update.
 *                 If the dimension of loss gradient E from previous layer is not equal to clipRect.size of corresponding forward MPSCNNConvolution,
 *                    i) one can insert a slice operation to extract out the region of size clipRect.size from appropriate offset in E and set primaryOffset = 0 Or
 *                   ii) set primatryOffset to offset in E at which valid data starts and make sure data outside is zeroed.
 *              2) secondaryOffset should be set to what offset property of MPSCNNConvolution was set to in forward pass.
 *
 *              Currently back propagation for gradients is only supported for regualar convolution and depthwise convolution. Back propagation
 *              sub-pixel convolution are not supported. So channelMultiplier and subPixelScaleFactor must be one.
 *
 *  Note on setting correct offsets
 *  ===============================
 *              If the forward convolution is called with
 *                              offset = _offset; kernelWidth = kW; kernelHeight = kH; strideInPixelsX = sX; strideInPixelsY = sY;
 *                              dilationRateX = dX; dilationRateY = dY;
 *              thus dilated filter parameters are
 *                              kW_Dilated = (kW - 1)*dX + 1; kH_Dilated = (kH - 1)*dY + 1;
 *              Then the correct offset can be computed as follows.
 *              Convoluton Gradient with Data
 *              =============================
 *                Convolution gradient with data of forward convolution with stride > 1 is essentially normal convoution with unit stride,
 *                on an image that is formed by inserting strideInPixelsX-1 zeros in between each column and strideInPixelsY-1 zeros in between each
 *                row of input gradient (output gradient of last layer) with kernel weights that are rotated by 180 degrees in spatial dimension (MPSCNNConvolutionGradient
 *                does this rotation internally). primaryOffset property defines offset in original input gradient coordinate system. In order to
 *                translate it in zero filled intermediate image coordinate system, kernelOffsetX and kernelOffsetY properties can be used as follows
 *                       offsetInZeroFilledImageX = primaryOffset.x * primaryStrideInPixelsX + kernelOffsetX;
 *                       offsetInZeroFilledImageY = primaryOffset.y * primaryStrideInPixelsY + kernelOffsetY;
 *                This is what internally MPSCNNConvolutionGradient do. In order to correctly match forward convolution offset setting (so that padding policy is
 *                consistent), application should set
 *                       primaryOffset.x = 0; primaryOffset.y = 0;
 *                       kernelOffset.x = -_offset.x + (~(NSInteger) kW_Dilated & 1L);
 *                       kernelOffset.y = -_offset.y + (~(NSInteger) kH_Dilated & 1L);
 *                Convolution gradient with data does not use secondaryOffset.
 *
 *                Convolution Gradient with Weights and Biases
 *                ============================================
 *                 For consistent padding policy with respect to forward convolution,
 *                       secondaryOffset.x = _offset.x - kW_Dilated/2
 *                       secondaryOffset.y = _offset.y - kH_Dilated/2
 *                 Convolution gradient with weights and biases does not use primaryOffset (or it is assumed to be zero) as summation is over entire
 *                 gradient image and only gradient image without any padding is currently accepted. If previous layer produces gradient image with
 *                 padding, slice operation should be used to extract out the gradient which will be input to MPSCNNConvolutionGradient.
 *
 *             Note that if application uses encode method that return destination gradient on left hand side and consumes MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState
 *             object produced by forward MPSCNNConvolution, all these parameters are set automatically for the application i.e. applicaiton does not
 *             need to worry about setting these.

 *  @dependency This depends on Metal.framework
 *  @discussion The MPSCNNFullyConnected specifies a fully connected convolution layer a.k.a. Inner product
 *              layer. A fully connected CNN layer is one where every input channel is connected
 *              to every output channel. The kernel width is equal to width of source image
 *              and the kernel height is equal to the height of source image. Width and height of the output
 *              is 1x1. Thus, it takes a srcW x srcH x Ni MPSCNNImage, convolves it with Weights[No][SrcW][srcH][Ni]
 *              and produces a 1 x 1 x No output. The following must be true:
 *@code
 *                         kernelWidth  == source.width
 *                         kernelHeight == source.height
 *                         clipRect.size.width == 1
 *                         clipRect.size.height == 1
 *@endcode
 *              One can think of a fully connected layer as a matrix multiplication that flattens an image into a vector of length
 *              srcW*srcH*Ni. The weights are arragned in a matrix of dimension No x (srcW*srcH*Ni) for product output vectors
 *              of length No. The strideInPixelsX, strideInPixelsY, and group must be 1. Offset is not applicable and is ignored.
 *              Since clipRect is clamped to the destination image bounds, if the destination is 1x1, one doesn't need to set the
 *              clipRect.
 *
 *              Note that one can implement an inner product using MPSCNNConvolution by setting
 *@code
 *                     offset = (kernelWidth/2,kernelHeight/2)
 *                     clipRect.origin = (ox,oy), clipRect.size = (1,1)
 *                     strideX = strideY = group = 1
 *@endcode
 *              However, using the MPSCNNFullyConnected for this is better for performance as it lets us choose the most
 *              performant method which may not be possible when using a general convolution. For example,
 *              we may internally use matrix multiplication or special reduction kernels for a specific platform.

 *  @discussion The MPSCNNConvolutionTranspose specifies a transposed convolution.
 *              The MPSCNNConvolutionTranspose convolves the input image with a set of filters, each producing one feature map in the output image.
 *
 *              Some third-party frameworks may rotate the weights spatially by 180 degrees for Convolution Transpose. MPS uses the weights
 *              specified by the developer as-is and does not perform any rotation. The developer may need to rotate the weights appropriately
 *              in case this rotation is needed before the convolution transpose is applied.
 *
 *              When the stride in any dimension is greater than 1, the convolution transpose puts (stride - 1) zeroes in-between the source 
 *              image pixels to create an expanded image. Then a convolution is done over the expanded image to generate the output of the 
 *              convolution transpose.
 *
 *              Intermediate image size = (srcSize - 1) * Stride + 1
 *
 *              Examples:
 *
 *
 *  @code
 *              So in case of sride == 2 (this behaves same in both dimensions)

 *
 *
 *              NOTE on Offset:
 *              There are 2 types of offsets defined:
 *              1) The Offset defined in MPSCNNKernel from which MPSCNNConvolutionTranspose inherits. This offset is applied to from where
 *                 the kernel will be applied on the source.
 *              2) The kernelOffsetX and kernelOffsetY which is the offset applied to the kernel when it is finally applied on the intermediate
 *                 image.
 *
 *              So totalOffset = Offset * stride + kernelOffset
 *
 *              The offset defined by user refers to the coordinate frame of the expanded image
 *              (we are showing only 1 dimension X it can be extended to Y dimension as well) :
 *
 *              X indicates where the convolution transpose begins:
 *
 *              Intermediate Image:  Offset = 0, kernelOffset = 0
 *               ___________________________
 *              |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 *              | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 4 |
 *              | X |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 *               ---------------------------
 *
 *
 *              X indicates where the convolution transpose begins:
 *
 *              Intermediate Image:  Offset = 0, kernelOffset = 1
 *               ___________________________
 *              |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

 *                 ---------------------------
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *              So if the user wanted to apply an offset of 2 on the source image of convolution transpose:
 *
 *              Source image:
 *               _______________
 *              |   |   |   |   |
 *              | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
 *              |   |   | X |   |
 *               ---------------
 *
 *              offset = 2, kernelOffset = 0
 *
 *              Intermediate Image:
 *               ___________________________
 *              |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 *              | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 4 |

/*! @abstract       Encode a MPSCNNKernel into a command Buffer. Create a texture to hold the result and return it.
 *  @discussion     In the first iteration on this method, encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImage:destinationImage:
 *                  some work was left for the developer to do in the form of correctly setting the offset property
 *                  and sizing the result buffer. With the introduction of the padding policy (see padding property)
 *                  the filter can do this work itself. If you would like to have some input into what sort of MPSImage
 *                  (e.g. temporary vs. regular) or what size it is or where it is allocated, you may set the
 *                  destinationImageAllocator to allocate the image yourself.
 *
 *                  This method uses the MPSNNPadding padding property to figure out how to size
 *                  the result image and to set the offset property. See discussion in MPSNeuralNetworkTypes.h.
 *
 *                  Note: the regular encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImage: method may be used when no state is needed,
 *                  such as when the convolution transpose operation is not balanced by a matching convolution object upstream.
 *                  These encode methods are for auto encoders where each convolution in inference pass is coupled with convolution
 *                  transpose. In order for convolution transpose to correctly undo the convolution downsampling, MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState
 *                  produced by convolution is needed by convolution transpose to correctly size destination image.
 *                  These methods are only useful for inference only network. For training, use encode methods that take MPSCNNConvolutionTransposeGradientState below.
 *
 *  @param          commandBuffer       The command buffer
 *  @param          sourceImage         A MPSImage to use as the source images for the filter.
 *  @param          convolutionGradientState    A valid MPSCNNConvolutionGradientState from the MPSCNNConvoluton counterpart to this MPSCNNConvolutionTranspose.
 *                                      If there is no forward convolution counterpart, pass NULL here. This state affects the sizing
 *                                      the result.
 *  @result         A MPSImage or MPSTemporaryImage allocated per the destinationImageAllocator containing the output of the graph.
 *                  The offset property will be adjusted to reflect the offset used during the encode.
 *                  The returned image will be automatically released when the command buffer completes. If you want to
 *                  keep it around for longer, retain the image. (ARC will do this for you if you use it later.)

 *  @class      MPSCNNBinaryConvolution
 *  @dependency This depends on Metal.framework
 *  @discussion The MPSCNNBinaryConvolution specifies a convolution with binary weights and an input image using binary approximations.
 *              The MPSCNNBinaryConvolution optionally first binarizes the input image and then convolves the result with a set of
 *              binary-valued filters, each producing one feature map in the output image (which is a normal image)
 *
 *              The output is computed as follows:
 *
 *                  out[i, x, y, c] = ( sum_{dx,dy,f} in[i,x+dx, y+dy, f] x B[c,dx,dy,f] )
 *                                      * scale[c] * beta[i,x,y] + bias[c], where
 *
 *              the sum over dx,dy is over the spatial filter kernel window defined by 'kernelWidth' and 'KernelHeight',
 *              sum over 'f' is over the input feature channel indices within group, 'B' contains the binary weights, interpreted as
 *              {-1,1} or { 0, 1 } and scale[c] is the 'outputScaleTerms' array and bias is the 'outputBiasTerms' array. Above 'i' is
 *              the image index in batch the sum over input channels 'f' runs through the group indices.
 *
 *              The convolution operator 'x' is defined by MPSCNNBinaryConvolutionType passed in at initialization time of the filter
 *              (@see initWithDevice).
 *              In case 'type' = MPSCNNBinaryConvolutionTypeBinaryWeights, the input image is not binarized at all
 *                  and the convolution is computed interpreting the weights as [ 0, 1 ] -> { -1, 1 } with the given scaling terms.
 *              In case 'type' = MPSCNNBinaryConvolutionTypeXNOR the convolution is computed by first binarizing the input image
 *                  using the sign function 'bin(x) = x < 0 ? -1 : 1' and the convolution multiplication is done with the
 *                  XNOR-operator !(x ^ y) = delta_xy = { (x==y) ? 1 : 0 },
 *                  and scaled according to the optional scaling operations. Note that we output the values of the bitwise convolutions
 *                  to interval { -1, 1 }, which means that the output of the XNOR-operator is scaled implicitly as follows:
 *                      r = 2 * ( !(x ^ y) ) - 1 = { -1, 1 }.
 *                  This means that for a dot-product of two 32-bit words the result is:
 *                      r = 2 * popcount(!(x ^ y) ) - 32 = 32 - 2 * popcount( x ^ y ) = { -32, -30, ..., 30, 32 }.
 *              In case 'type' = MPSCNNBinaryConvolutionTypeAND the convolution is computed by first binarizing the input image
 *                  using the sign function 'bin(x) = x < 0 ? -1 : 1' and the convolution multiplication is done with the
 *                  AND-operator (x & y) = delta_xy * delta_x1 = { (x==y==1) ? 1 : 0 }.
 *                  and scaled according to the optional scaling operations. Note that we output the values of the AND-operation is
 *                  assumed to lie in { 0, 1 } interval and hence no more implicit scaling takes place.
 *                  This means that for a dot-product of two 32-bit words the result is:
 *                      r = popcount(x & y) = { 0, ..., 31, 32 }.
 *
 *              The input data can be pre-offset and scaled by providing the 'inputBiasTerms' and 'inputScaleTerms' parameters for the
 *              initialization functions and this can be used for example to accomplish batch normalization of the data. The scaling of
 *              input values happens before possible beta-image computation.
 *
 *              The parameter 'beta' above is an optional image which is used to compute scaling factors for each spatial position and image index.
 *              For the XNOR-Net based networks this is computed as follows: beta[i,x,y] = sum_{dx,dy} A[i, x+dx, y+dy] / (kx * ky), where
 *              (dx,dy) are summed over the convolution filter window [ -kx/2, (kx-1)/2], [ -ky/2, (ky-1)/2 ] and
 *              A[i,x,y] = sum_{c} abs( in[i,x,y,c] ) / Nc, where 'in' is the original input image (in full precision) and Nc is the
 *              number of input channels in the input image. Parameter 'beta' is not passed as input and to enable beta-scaling the user can
 *              provide 'MPSCNNBinaryConvolutionFlagsUseBetaScaling' in the flags parameter in the initialization functions.
 *
 *              Finally the normal activation neuron is applied and the result is written to the output image.
 *
 *              NOTE: MPSCNNBinaryConvolution does not currently support groups > 1.

 *  @param      convolutionData                 A pointer to a object that conforms to the MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource protocol.
 *                                              The MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource protocol declares the methods that an
 *                                              instance of MPSCNNBinaryFullyConnected uses to obtain the weights and the convolution descriptor.
 *                                              Each entry in the convolutionData:weights array is a 32-bit unsigned integer value
 *                                              and each bit represents one filter weight (given in machine byte order).
 *                                              The featurechannel indices increase from the least significant bit within the 32-bits.
 *                                              The number of entries is =
 *                                              ceil( inputFeatureChannels/32.0 ) * outputFeatureChannels * kernelHeight * kernelWidth
 *                                              The layout of filter weight is so that it can be reinterpreted as a 4D tensor (array)

 *                                              (The ordering of the reduction from 4D tensor to 1D is per C convention. The index based on
 *                                              inputchannels varies most rapidly, followed by kernelWidth, then kernelHeight and finally

 *                                              The values stored in the pointer are copied in and the array can be freed after this function returns.
 *  @param      outputScaleTerms                A pointer to scale terms to be applied to binary convolution results per output feature channel.
 *                                              Each entry is a float value. The number of entries is = numberOfOutputFeatureMaps. If nil then 1.0 is used.
 *                                              The values stored in the pointer are copied in and the array can be freed after this function returns.
 *  @param      inputBiasTerms                  A pointer to offset terms to be applied to the input before convolution and before input scaling.
 *                                              Each entry is a float value. The number of entries is 'inputFeatureChannels'. If NULL then 0.0 is used for bias.
 *                                              The values stored in the pointer are copied in and the array can be freed after this function returns.
 *  @param      inputScaleTerms                 A pointer to scale terms to be applied to the input before convolution, but after input biasing.
 *                                              Each entry is a float value. The number of entries is 'inputFeatureChannels'. If nil then 1.0 is used.

 *  @discussion The MPSNNGramMatrixCalculation filter specifies a layer which computes the uncentered cross-correlation
 *              values between the image planes of each feature channel of an image. If the input image batch is
 *              x = x[b, y, x, c], where 'b' is batch index, 'y' and 'x' are the image coordinate and
 *              'c' is the feature channel index then this filter computes the values:
 *
 *              y = y[b, 1, f, c] = alpha * sum_{x,y} x[b,y,x,f] * x[b,y,x,c], where
 *
 *              'alpha' is a scaling factor. This operation can be interpreted to be computing all combinations
 *              of fully connected layers between the different image planes of the input image. The results
 *              are stored in the feature channel and 'x'-coordinate indices of the output batch.
 *              The operation is performed independently on different images in the batch.
 *
 *              NOTE: Due to the nature of the operation this filter specifies a special padding policy
 *              and hence does not support non-default offset or cliprect properties.

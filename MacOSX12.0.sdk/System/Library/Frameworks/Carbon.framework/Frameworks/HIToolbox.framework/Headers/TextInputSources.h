/*
 *  TextInputSources.h
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Specifies the modern, non-Script-Manager-based interfaces for
 *    operating on text input sources: finding information about them,
 *    selecting/enabling/disabling them, and receiving notifications
 *    about relevant changes.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Text input sources are of three general categories: keyboard
 *    input sources (keyboard layouts, keyboard input methods and input
 *    modes), palette input sources (character palette, keyboard
 *    viewer, private dictionary panels), and ink. Palette input
 *    sources and ink input sources are categorized as non-keyboard
 *    input sources, although palette input sources may still involve
 *    some keyboard interaction. Keyboard input methods may be
 *    mode-enabled (e.g. Kotoeri), in which case they may be the parent
 *    of several input modes which are directly selectable in the user
 *    interface (e.g. hiragana, katakana, romaji); in this case the
 *    parent input method is not directly selectable. Non-mode-enabled
 *    input methods are directly selectable. 
 *    
 *    
 *    Some input sources are invisible to system UI; they do not appear
 *    in the normal user interface for manipulating input sources.
 *    Examples include input sources such as ink, the dictionary panel,
 *    and some assistiveware; these have their own special UI for
 *    enabling, disabling, etc. Other examples include special keyboard
 *    layouts used by input methods, which have their own ways of
 *    controlling use of these keyboard layouts. 
 *    
 *    
 *    Some input sources are pre-installed by Apple. Other input
 *    sources (of any type) may be installed as third party products
 *    themselves or as part of installing certain applications. Most
 *    non-invisible input sources may be enabled or disabled by users
 *    using International Preferences, which displays a list of all
 *    visible installed input sources (Setup Assistant also enables
 *    some input sources); there is a separate UI for enabling ink.
 *    Applications may enable or disable input sources programmatically
 *    using some of the functions here. At least one keyboard input
 *    source is enabled (the system ensures this). At most one ink
 *    input source may be enabled; multiple instances of other input
 *    source types may be enabled. 
 *    
 *    
 *    Some enabled input sources are invisible but programmatically
 *    selectable, such as ink. Some are visible but not
 *    programmatically selectable, such as mode-savvy parent input
 *    methods (which must be visible so that International Preferences
 *    can display the parent input method for a group of input modes).
 *    
 *    
 *    
 *    Input modes can only be changed from disabled to enabled if their
 *    parent input method is enabled. Input modes can only be selected
 *    if both they and their parent input method are enabled. 
 *     
 *    
 *    Exactly one keyboard input source is selected at any time; this
 *    is the current keyboard input source. Selecting a new keyboard
 *    input source deselects the previous keyboard input source.
 *    Multiple palette input sources may be selected - e.g. there may
 *    be one or more character palettes and one or more keyboard
 *    viewers selected in addition to the selected keyboard input
 *    source. Selecting or deselecting a palette (or ink) input source
 *    does not affect any other input source. Input methods that
 *    provide associated input palettes may programmatically deselect
 *    the palette when the input method is deselected, for example.
 *
 *
 *    Mac OS X threading:
 *    TextInputSources API is not thread safe. If you are a UI application, you must call TextInputSources API on the main thread.
 *    If you are a non-UI application (such as a cmd-line tool or a launchagent that does not run an event loop), you must not call TextInputSources API from multiple
 *    threads concurrently.

 *    Creates a list of input sources that match specified properties.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This list represents a snapshot of input sources that matched the
 *    specified properties at the time the call was made. If the caller
 *    desires to include input sources that are installed but not
 *    currently enabled, the includeAllInstalled parameter may be set
 *    true. Typically this is done in order to obtain a
 *    TISInputSourceRef for a newly-installed input source; in this
 *    case the properties parameter would include very specific
 *    criteria limiting the matching input sources. 
 *    
 *    Warning: Calling this with includeAllInstalled true can have
 *    significant memory impact on the calling application if the
 *    properties parameter is NULL (match all) or if it specifies
 *    criteria that may match many installed input sources, since this
 *    may force caching of data for all matching input sources (which
 *    can result in allocation of up to 120K). If
 *    TISCreateInputSourceList is being called in order to find a
 *    specific input source or sources from among the sources included
 *    in the list, then it is best to first call
 *    TISCreateInputSourceList with includeAllInstalled = false and
 *    check whether the returned array includes the desired input
 *    source(s); if not, then call TISCreateInputSourceList again with
 *    includeAllInstalled = true.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    properties:
 *      Dictionary of property keys and corresponding values to filter
 *      the input source list. May be NULL, in which case no filtering
 *      is performed.
 *    
 *    includeAllInstalled:
 *      Normally false so that only enabled input sources will be
 *      included; set true to include all installed input sources that
 *      match the filter (see discussion).

 *  TISSetInputMethodKeyboardLayoutOverride()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Sets the keyboard layout override for an input method or mode.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    When an input method or mode is the selected input source, TSM
 *    will by default use the most-recently-used ASCII-capable keyboard
 *    layout to translate key events* (this keyboard layout is also the
 *    one that will appear in Keyboard Viewer); an input source for
 *    this keyboard layout is returned by
 *    TISCopyCurrentASCIICapableKeyboardLayout. If a different keyboard
 *    layout should be used for a particular input method or mode, then
 *    when that input method/mode is activated it should call
 *    TISSetInputMethodKeyboardLayoutOverride to specify the desired
 *    keyboard layout. 
 *    
 *    For example, when a Kotoeri user selects kana layout for kana
 *    input, Kotoeri should call
 *    TISSetInputMethodKeyboardLayoutOverride to set the kana keyboard
 *    as the override for the appropriate input modes. 
 *    
 *    The keyboard layout set in this way will be used for the final
 *    stage of key translation in the Window Server - the connection or
 *    application-specific key translation. 
 *    
 *    The override setting is lost when the input method that set it is
 *    deactivated. 
 *    
 *    The keyboardLayout to be used for overriding need not be enabled
 *    or explicitly selectable. It can be a non-selectable layout that
 *    is included in an input method bundle and automatically
 *    registered. 
 *    
 *    *The default behavior is new for Mac OS X 10.5, and is meant to
 *    eliminate the necessity for input methods to have UI for setting
 *    which ASCII- capable keyboard to use for latin-character-based
 *    phonetic input.
 *

*===============================================================================
*   Text Input Sources properties and bundle-packaged text input sources
*===============================================================================
*
*   For Leopard, there are two new keys for use in plists to provide information
*   that supports the Text Input Sources functions above (these keys will be
*   ignored in earlier systems):
*
*   "TISInputSourceID" - a key to specify the InputSourceID, a reverse-DNS-style
*   string meant to uniquely identify any input source. If this key is not
*   specified, the Text Input Sources functions will attempt to construct an
*   InputSourceID from other information.
*
*   "TISIntendedLanguage" - a key to specify the primary language which the
*   input source is intended to input. If there is none - as with the Unicode
*   Hex Input key layout, for example - this key need not be specified. The
*   language is indicated by a string in in the format described by BCP 47
*   (the successor to RFC 3066).
*
*   How these keys are used depends on the type of input source, as described
*   below.
*
*   1. Keyboard layouts ( in <domain>/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ )
*
*   Keyboard layouts packaged in bundles use either a resource file or a set of
*   xml keylayout files together with optional icns files. The following example
*   shows the two methods of packaging a set of two key layouts in Unicode 'uchr'
*   format with key layout names "MyLayoutOne" and "MyLayoutTwo" and corresponding
*   numeric IDs -9001 and -9002 (see Tech Note 2056).
*
*   MyKeyboardLayouts.bundle/
*       Contents/
*           Info.plist
*           version.plist
*           Resources/
*               MyKeyboardLayouts.rsrc, containing the following resources:
*                   resources 'uchr' (-9001, "MyLayoutOne"), 'kcs#' (-9001), 'kcs4' (-9001)
*                   resources 'uchr' (-9002, "MyLayoutTwo"), 'kcs#' (-9002), 'kcs4' (-9002)
*               en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings, maps "MyLayoutOne" & "MyLayoutTwo" to localized names
*               ja.lproj/InfoPlist.strings, maps "MyLayoutOne" & "MyLayoutTwo" to localized names
*               ...
*
*   MyKeyboardLayouts.bundle/
*       Contents/
*           Info.plist
*           version.plist
*           Resources/
*               MyLayoutOne.keylayout, specifying name="MyLayoutOne" and id=-9001
*               MyLayoutOne.icns (optional)
*               MyLayoutTwo.keylayout, specifying name="MyLayoutTwo" and id=-9002
*               MyLayoutTwo.icns (optional)
*               en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings, maps "MyLayoutOne" & "MyLayoutTwo" to localized names
*               ja.lproj/InfoPlist.strings, maps "MyLayoutOne" & "MyLayoutTwo" to localized names
*               ...
*
*   In the Info.plist file, the value for the CFBundleIdentifier key must be a
*   string that includes ".keyboardlayout."; typically this might be something
*   like "com.companyname.keyboardlayout.MyKeyboardLayouts" (Before Leopard,
*   it was required to be a string that began "com.apple.keyboardlayout", even
*   for keyboard layouts not supplied by Apple).
*
*   A dictionary of properties for each key layout in the bundle should be
*   provided using a key of the form "KLInfo_keylayoutname" (even if
*   keylayoutname includes spaces or punctuation). This dictionary is where to
*   specify the keys "TISInputSourceID" and "TISIntendedLanguage" and their
*   associated values.
*
*   "TISInputSourceID" note: For keyboard layouts this should typically be
*   something like "com.companyname.keylayout.keylayoutname". If this key is
*   not specified, an InputSourceID will be constructed by combining
*   bundleID + ". keylayout." + keylayoutname.
*
*   If the keyboard layouts in the above example were intended to input
*   Azerbaijani in Latin script, then the Info.plist entries could be:
*
*       <key>KLInfo_MyLayoutOne</key>
*       <dict>
*           <key>TISInputSourceID</key>
*           <string>com.companyname.keylayout.MyLayoutOne</string>
*           <key>TISIntendedLanguage</key>
*           <string>az-Latn</string>
*       </dict>
*       <key>KLInfo_MyLayoutTwo</key>
*       <dict>
*           <key>TISInputSourceID</key>
*           <string>com.companyname.keylayout.MyLayoutTwo</string>
*           <key>TISIntendedLanguage</key>
*           <string>az-Latn</string>
*       </dict>
*
*   2. Input methods
*
*   Input methods are always packaged as bundles, either as Component bundles
*   in "<domain>/Library/Components/" (the old way, still supported in Leopard)
*   or as application bundles in "<domain>/Library/Input Methods/" (new for
*   Leopard).
*
*   The new keys keys "TISInputSourceID" and "TISIntendedLanguage" and their
*   associated values are added at the top level of the Info.plist file.
*
*   "TISInputSourceID" note: For input methods this is typically the same as
*   the BundleID, and if this key is not specified the BundleID will be used
*   as the InputSourceID.
*
*   3. Input modes
*
*   An input method's input modes are defined using the "ComponentInputModeDict"
*   key at the top level of the input method's Info.plist file (even for
*   non-component application-based input methods). The value of this key is a
*   dictionary, one of whose keys is "tsInputModeListKey"; the value of this
*   key is also a dictionary of input modes, with the InputModeID as the key
*   and the input mode's dictionary as the value (see TextServices.h).
*
*   The new keys keys "TISInputSourceID" and "TISIntendedLanguage" and their
*   associated values are added to the input mode's dictionary.
*
*   "TISInputSourceID" note: For input modes this is a string that begins with
*   the parent input method's InputSourceID or BundleID, followed by something
*   that identifies the mode. For example, "com.apple.Kotoeri.Japanese.Katakana".
*   In general it is not necessarily the same as the InputModeID, since a
*   particular InputModeID such as "com.apple.inputmethod.Japanese.Katakana"
*   may be used by multiple input methods. If this key is not specified, an
*   InputSourceID will be constructed by combining the BundleID with an
*   InputModeID suffix formed by deleting any prefix that matches the BundleID
*   or that ends in ".inputmethod."

	@abstract	A VTFrameSilo stores a large number of sample buffers, as produced by a multi-pass compression session.
	@discussion
		The sample buffers are ordered by decode timestamp. 
		A VTFrameSilo starts out empty and is populated by calls to VTFrameSiloAddSampleBuffer to add sample buffers in ascending decode order.
		After the first full pass, additional passes may be performed to replace sample buffers.
		Each such pass must begin with a call to VTFrameSiloSetTimeRangesForNextPass, which takes a list of time ranges.
		Samples in these time ranges are deleted, and calls to VTFrameSiloAddSampleBuffer can then be made to provide replacements.
		Call VTFrameSiloCallFunctionForEachSampleBuffer or VTFrameSiloCallBlockForEachSampleBuffer to retrieve sample buffers.
		The VTFrameSilo may write sample buffers and data to the backing file between addition and retrieval; 
		do not expect to get identical object pointers back.

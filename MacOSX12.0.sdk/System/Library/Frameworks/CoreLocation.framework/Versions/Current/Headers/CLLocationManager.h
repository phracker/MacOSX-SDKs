/*
 *  requestTemporaryFullAccuracyAuthorizationWithPurposeKey:completion:
 *
 *  Discussion:
 *      If your app doesn't have permission to access accurate location (see
 *      -accuracyAuthorization), you can use this method to request temporary access
 *      to accurate location.  This access will expire automatically, but it won't expire
 *      while the user is still engaged with your app.  So, for example, while your app
 *      is in the foreground your app will retain the temporary access it was granted.
 *      Similarly, if your app starts a Continuous Background Location session with the
 *      background location indicator enabled (see -showsBackgroundLocationIndicator),
 *      your access to accurate location will remain as long as the background location
 *      indicator remains enabled.  This allows your app to provide session-oriented
 *      experiences which require accurate location (e.g. fitness or navigation), even if
 *      the user has decided not to grant your app persistent access to accurate location.
 *
 *      When CoreLocation prepares the prompt for display, it will look at the
 *      NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary key in your Info.plist.  The value
 *      should be a dictionary containing usage descriptions.  The purposeKey you provide
 *      to this method must correspond to an entry in that dictionary.  To retrieve a
 *      localized string, CoreLocation will load your InfoPlist.strings file and try to
 *      look up a string using the purposeKey you provided.  If that fails, CoreLocation
 *      will use the content provided in your Info.plist.  For example, suppose your
 *      Info.plist contains the following.
 *
 *          <key>NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary</key>
 *          <dict>
 *            <key>ExampleUsageDescription</key>
 *            <string>This app needs accurate location so it can verify that you're in a supported region.</string>
 *            <key>AnotherUsageDescription</key>
 *            <string>This app needs accurate location so it can show you relevant results.</string>
 *          </dict>
 *
 *      In this case, you would be able to provide either "ExampleUsageDescription" or
 *      "AnotherUsageDescription" for the purposeKey argument.  Passing any other string
 *      would result in the prompt not being displayed.  To localize these usage
 *      descriptions, you would add entries for "ExampleUsageDescription" and
 *      "AnotherUsageDescription" to your InfoPlist.strings file.
 *
 *      CoreLocation may decide against showing the user a prompt.  For example, if your
 *      app already has access to accurate location or it is currently in the background.
 *      When that happens, your completion block will be called with an appropriate
 *      NSError.  If the user responded to the prompt, your completion block will be
 *      called with a nil error.  At that point, you may query the state of your
 *      CLLocationManager to see if you have been granted accurate access.
 *
 *      The completion block will be called in the same threading context where delegate

 *		delivery. Once an exit condition is met, the location manager will
 *		continue normal updates until this method is invoked again.
 *
 *		Exit conditions, distance and timeout, can be specified using the constants
 *		CLLocationDistanceMax and CLTimeIntervalMax, respectively, if you are
 *		trying to achieve an unlimited distance or timeout.
 *
 *		The CLLocationManagerDelegate will continue to receive normal updates as
 *		long as the application remains in the foreground. While the process is
 *		in the background, the device may be able to enter a low-power state for
 *		portions of the specified distance and time interval. While in this
 *		state, locations will be coalesced for later delivery.
 *
 *		Location updates will be deferred as much as is reasonable to save
 *		power. If another process is using location, the device may not enter a
 *		low-power state and instead updates will continue normally. Deferred
 *		updates may be interspersed with normal updates if the device exits and
 *		re-enters a low-power state.
 *
 *		All location updates, including deferred updates, will be delivered via
 *		the delegate callback locationManager:didUpdateLocations:
 *
 *		When deferred updates have ended, the manager will invoke the delegate
 *		callback locationManagerDidFinishDeferredUpdates:withError:. An error
 *		will be returned if the manager will not defer updates and the exit

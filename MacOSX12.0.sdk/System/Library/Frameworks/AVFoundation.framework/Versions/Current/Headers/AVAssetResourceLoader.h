  @class		AVAssetResourceLoader

  @abstract		An AVAssetResourceLoader mediates requests to load resources required by an AVURLAsset by asking a delegate object that you provide for assistance. When a resource is required that cannot be loaded by the AVURLAsset itself, the resource loader makes a request of its delegate to load it and proceeds according to the delegate's response.
	
  @discussion
	You should not create resource loader objects. Instead, you should retrieve a resource loader from the resourceLoader property of an AVURLAsset and use it to assign your delegate object for resource loading.
 
	The delegate associated with this object must adopt the AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate protocol.

  If you employ an AVAssetResourceLoader delegate that loads media data for playback, you should set the value of your AVPlayer’s automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling property to NO. Allowing the value of automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling to remain YES — its default value — when an AVAssetResourceLoader delegate is used for the loading of media data can result in poor start-up times for playback and poor recovery from stalls, because the behaviors provided by AVPlayer when automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling has a value of YES depend on predictions of the future availability of media data that that do not function as expected when data is loaded via a client-controlled means, using the AVAssetResourceLoader delegate interface.

  You can allow the value of automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling to remain YES if you use an AVAssetResourceLoader delegate to manage content keys for FairPlay Streaming, to provide dynamically-generated master playlists for HTTP Live Streaming, or to respond to authentication challenges, but not to load media data for playback.

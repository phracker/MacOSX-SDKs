	Instances of AVAssetWriter can write media to new files in formats such as the QuickTime movie file format or the MPEG-4 file format. AVAssetWriter has support for automatic interleaving of media data for multiple concurrent tracks. Source media data can be obtained from instances of AVAssetReader for one or more assets or from other sources outside of AVFoundation.

	Instances of AVAssetWriter can re-encode media samples as they are written. Instances of AVAssetWriter can also optionally write metadata collections to the output file.
 
	A single instance of AVAssetWriter can be used once to write to a single file. Clients that wish to write to files multiple times must use a new instance of AVAssetWriter each time.

 @discussion
	Sequences of sample data appended to the asset writer inputs are considered to fall within "sample-writing sessions", initiated with this method. Accordingly, this method must be called after writing has started (using -startWriting) but before any sample data is appended to the receiver's inputs.
	
	Each writing session has a start time which, where allowed by the file format being written, defines the mapping from the timeline of source samples to the timeline of the written file. In the case of the QuickTime movie file format, the first session begins at movie time 0, so a sample appended with timestamp T will be played at movie time (T-startTime).  Samples with timestamps earlier than startTime will still be added to the output file but will be edited out (i.e. not presented during playback). If the earliest appended sample for an input has a timestamp later than than startTime, an empty edit will be inserted to preserve synchronization between tracks of the output asset.
	
	To end the session started by use of this method, use -endSessionAtSourceTime: or -finishWritingWithCompletionHandler:.  It is an error to invoke -startSessionAtSourceTime: twice in a row without invoking -endSessionAtSourceTime: in between.

 @discussion
	Call this method to complete a session started with -startSessionAtSourceTime:.
 
	The endTime defines the moment on the timeline of source samples at which the session ends. In the case of the QuickTime movie file format, each sample-writing session's startTime...endTime pair corresponds to a period of movie time into which the session's samples are inserted. Samples with timestamps that are later than the session end time will still be added to the written file but will be edited out (i.e. not presented during playback). So if the first session has duration D1 = endTime - startTime, it will be inserted into the written file at time 0 through D1; the second session would be inserted into the written file at time D1 through D1+D2, etc. It is legal to have a session with no samples; this will cause creation of an empty edit of the prescribed duration.
	
	It is not mandatory to call -endSessionAtSourceTime:; if -finishWritingWithCompletionHandler: is called without first invoking -endSessionAtSourceTime:, the session's effective end time will be the latest end timestamp of the session's appended samples (i.e. no samples will be edited out at the end).
 
	It is an error to append samples outside of a sample-writing session.  To append more samples after invoking -endSessionAtSourceTime:, you must first start a new session using -startSessionAtSourceTime:.

 @method assetWriter:didOutputSegmentData:segmentType:segmentReport:
 @abstract
	A method invoked when a segment data is output.

 @param writer
	An AVAssetWriter instance.
 @param segmentData
	An instance of NSData containing a segment data.
 @param segmentType
	A segment type of the segment data. Segment types are declared in AVAssetSegmentReport.h.
 @param segmentReport
	An AVAssetSegmentReport instance.

 @discussion
	If this method is implemented, normal file writing will be suppressed. The instance of AVAssetWriter must be initialized by -initWithContentType: initializer.
	Then, clients append media data to AVAssetWriterInputs added to the receiver, call -markAsFinished for each input to mark the input as finished and call -finishWritingWithCompletionHandler: to finish writing as is the case in normal file writing.

	Do not use the movieFragmentInterval or shouldOptimizeForNetworkUse properties, as these properties are ignored in this mode of operation.

	Clients that need to reference the NSData outside of the scope of this method must retain or copy it and then release it when they are finished with it.

	The segmentReport provides information on the segment data. If there is no information available to report, the segmentReport may be nil.
	Clients that do not need information on consecutive segment data should implement the -assetWriter:didOutputSegmentData:segmentType: method instead of this one for greater efficiency, as this will signal the receiver to skip the preparation of segment reports.
	See more detailed description of AVAssetSegmentReport in AVAssetSegmentReport.h.

	If the file type is AVFileTypeMPEG4 and the outputFileTypeProfile is AVFileTypeProfileMPEG4AppleHLS or AVFileTypeProfileMPEG4CMAFCompliant, when the segmentType is AVAssetSegmentTypeInitialization, the segment contains a 'moov' atom that does not contain any sample tables other than the sample descriptions, and is suitable for use as an initialization segment for the following segment data sequences.
	When the segmentType is AVAssetSegmentTypeSeparable, the segment contains a 'moof' atom  that contains one 'moof' atom followed by one 'mdat' atom.

	1. If the value of preferredOutputSegmentInterval property is positive numeric, when (a sample's output PTS - InitialSegmentStartTime) >= (interval * N) (N = 1, 2, 3...), the receiver waits for next sync sample and outputs a segment data that includes all samples appended since the previous interval to the delegate method when the sync sample appears, so that the next segment can start with the sync sample.
	In this configuration, passthrough (by passing nil to output settings for AVAssetWriterInputs) and compression are available. The media type of input can be AVMediaTypeVideo or AVMediaTypeAudio.
	Only one input of each media type can be added for compression and when (a sample's PTS - InitialSegmentStartTime) >= (interval * N) (N = 1, 2, 3...), the sample will be forced to be encoded as sync sample so that the current segment will be closed immediately.
	For passthrough, only one input can be added.

	2. If the value of preferredOutputSegmentInterval property is kCMTimeIndefinite, every time a client calls -flushSegment the receiver outputs a segment data that includes all samples appended since the previous call to the delegate method.
	The delegate method may be called asynchronously, on a different thread from the one that calls -flushSegment.
	In this configuration, only passthrough is available. The media type of input can be AVMediaTypeVideo or AVMediaTypeAudio.
	Only one input of each media type can be added.
	The client should call -flushSegment prior to a sync sample so that the next segment can start with the sync sample. Otherwise, it is an error.

	The usage of this method is same as -assetWriter:didOutputSegmentData:segmentType:segmentReport: except that this method does not deliver AVAssetSegmentReport.

	If clients implement the -assetWriter:didOutputSegmentData:segmentType:segmentReport: method, that method is called instead of this one.

 @class AVAssetTrackGroup
 @abstract
	A class whose instances describe a group of tracks in an asset.
 
 @discussion
	Instances of AVAssetTrackGroup describe a single group of related tracks in an asset. For example, a track group can
	describe a set of alternate tracks, which are tracks containing variations of the same content, such as content
	translated into different languages, out of which only one track should be played at a time.
 
	Clients can inspect the track groups contained in an AVAsset by loading and obtaining the value of its trackGroups property.

 @class AVCaptureStillImageOutput
 @abstract
    AVCaptureStillImageOutput is a concrete subclass of AVCaptureOutput that can be used to capture high-quality still images with accompanying metadata.
 
 @discussion
    Instances of AVCaptureStillImageOutput can be used to capture, on demand, high quality snapshots from a realtime capture source. Clients can request a still image for the current time using the captureStillImageAsynchronouslyFromConnection:completionHandler: method. Clients can also configure still image outputs to produce still images in specific image formats.

    A block that will be called when the still image capture is complete. The block will be passed a CMSampleBuffer object containing the image data or an NSError object if an image could not be captured.
 
 @discussion
    This method will return immediately after it is invoked, later calling the provided completion handler block when image data is ready. If the request could not be completed, the error parameter will contain an NSError object describing the failure.
 
    Attachments to the image data sample buffer may contain metadata appropriate to the image data format. For instance, a sample buffer containing JPEG data may carry a kCGImagePropertyExifDictionary as an attachment. See <ImageIO/CGImageProperties.h> for a list of keys and value types.

    Calls to captureStillImageAsynchronouslyFromConnection:completionHandler: are not synchronized with AVCaptureDevice manual control completion handlers. Setting a device manual control, waiting for its completion, then calling captureStillImageAsynchronouslyFromConnection:completionHandler: DOES NOT ensure that the still image returned reflects your manual control change. It may be from an earlier time. You can compare your manual control completion handler sync time to the returned still image's presentation time. You can retrieve the sample buffer's pts using CMSampleBufferGetPresentationTimestamp(). If the still image has an earlier timestamp, your manual control command does not apply to it.

 @discussion
    On a receiver where -isLensStabilizationDuringBracketedCaptureSupported returns YES, lens stabilization may be applied to the bracket to reduce blur commonly found in low light photos. When lens stabilization is enabled, bracketed still image captures incur additional latency. Lens stabilization is more effective with longer-exposure captures, and offers limited or no benefit for exposure durations shorter than 1/30 of a second. It is possible that during the bracket, the lens stabilization module may run out of correction range and therefore will not be active for every frame in the bracket. Each emitted CMSampleBuffer from the bracket will have an attachment of kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_StillImageLensStabilizationInfo indicating additional information about stabilization was applied to the buffer, if any. The default value of -isLensStabilizationDuringBracketedCaptureEnabled is NO. This value will be set to NO when -isLensStabilizationDuringBracketedCaptureSupported changes to NO.

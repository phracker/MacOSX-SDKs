	AVAssetReaderOutput is an abstract class that defines an interface for reading a single collection of samples of a common media type from an AVAssetReader.

	Clients can read the media data of an asset by adding one or more concrete instances of AVAssetReaderOutput to an AVAssetReader using the -[AVAssetReader addOutput:] method.
	
	IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE NOTE: Make sure to set the alwaysCopiesSampleData property to NO if you do not need to modify the sample data in-place, to avoid unnecessary and inefficient copying.

	An NSArray of NSValue objects, each representing a single CMTimeRange structure
 
 @discussion
	This method may only be used if supportsRandomAccess has been set to YES and may not be called after -markConfigurationAsFinal has been invoked.
 
	This method is often used in conjunction with AVAssetWriter multi-pass (see AVAssetWriterInput category AVAssetWriterInputMultiPass).  In this usage, the caller will invoke -copyNextSampleBuffer until that method returns NULL and then ask the AVAssetWriterInput for a set of time ranges from which it thinks media data should be re-encoded.  These time ranges are then given to this method to set up the asset reader output for the next pass.
 
	The time ranges set here override the time range set on AVAssetReader.timeRange.  Just as with that property, for each time range in the array the intersection of that time range and CMTimeRangeMake(kCMTimeZero, asset.duration) will take effect.  If the start times of each time range in the array are not strictly increasing or if two or more time ranges in the array overlap, an NSInvalidArgumentException will be raised.  It is an error to include a time range with a non-numeric start time or duration (see CMTIME_IS_NUMERIC), unless the duration is kCMTimePositiveInfinity.
 
	If this method is invoked after the status of the attached AVAssetReader has become AVAssetReaderStatusFailed or AVAssetReaderStatusCancelled, no change in status will occur and the result of the next call to -copyNextSampleBuffer will be NULL.
 
	If this method is invoked before all media data has been read (i.e. -copyNextSampleBuffer has not yet returned NULL), an exception will be thrown.  This method may not be called before -startReading has been invoked on the attached asset reader.

 @param outputSettings

	An instance of AVAssetReaderTrackOutput.

 @discussion
	The track must be one of the tracks contained by the target AVAssetReader's asset.
	
	A value of nil for outputSettings configures the output to vend samples in their original format as stored by the specified track.  Initialization will fail if the output settings cannot be used with the specified track.
	
	AVAssetReaderTrackOutput can only produce uncompressed output.  For audio output settings, this means that AVFormatIDKey must be kAudioFormatLinearPCM.  For video output settings, this means that the dictionary must follow the rules for uncompressed video output, as laid out in AVVideoSettings.h.  AVAssetReaderTrackOutput does not support the AVAudioSettings.h key AVSampleRateConverterAudioQualityKey or the following AVVideoSettings.h keys:
 
		AVVideoCleanApertureKey
		AVVideoPixelAspectRatioKey
		AVVideoScalingModeKey
	
	When constructing video output settings the choice of pixel format will affect the performance and quality of the decompression. For optimal performance when decompressing video the requested pixel format should be one that the decoder supports natively to avoid unnecessary conversions. Below are some recommendations:

	For H.264 use kCVPixelFormatType_420YpCbCr8BiPlanarVideoRange, or kCVPixelFormatType_420YpCbCr8BiPlanarFullRange if the video is known to be full range.  For JPEG on iOS, use kCVPixelFormatType_420YpCbCr8BiPlanarFullRange.

	For other codecs on OSX, kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr8 is the preferred pixel format for video and is generally the most performant when decoding. If you need to work in the RGB domain then kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA is recommended on iOS and kCVPixelFormatType_32ARGB is recommended on OSX.
 
	ProRes encoded media can contain up to 12bits/ch. If your source is ProRes encoded and you wish to preserve more than 8bits/ch during decompression then use one of the following pixel formats: kCVPixelFormatType_4444AYpCbCr16, kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr16, kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr10, or kCVPixelFormatType_64ARGB.  AVAssetReader does not support scaling with any of these high bit depth pixel formats. If you use them then do not specify kCVPixelBufferWidthKey or kCVPixelBufferHeightKey in your outputSettings dictionary. If you plan to append these sample buffers to an AVAssetWriterInput then note that only the ProRes encoders support these pixel formats.

	ProRes 4444 encoded media can contain a mathematically lossless alpha channel. To preserve the alpha channel during decompression use a pixel format with an alpha component such as kCVPixelFormatType_4444AYpCbCr16 or kCVPixelFormatType_64ARGB. To test whether your source contains an alpha channel check that the track's format description has kCMFormatDescriptionExtension_Depth and that its value is 32.

	This method will return nil when all timed metadata groups have been read from the asset reader output, or if there is an error that prevents the timed metadata group adaptor from reading more timed metadata groups.  When this method returns nil, clients should check the value of the associated AVAssetReader's status property to determine why no more samples could be read.
	
	Unlike -[AVAssetReaderTrackOutput copyNextSampleBuffer], this method returns an autoreleased object.
 
	Before calling this method, you must ensure that the output which underlies the receiver is attached to an AVAssetReader via a prior call to -addOutput: and that -startReading has been called on the asset reader.

/*!
 @class AVAssetReaderSampleReferenceOutput
 @abstract
	AVAssetReaderSampleReferenceOutput is a concrete subclass of AVAssetReaderOutput that defines an interface for reading sample references from a single AVAssetTrack of an AVAssetReader's AVAsset.
 @discussion
	Clients can extract information about the location (file URL and offset) of samples in a track by adding an instance of AVAssetReaderSampleReferenceOutput to an AVAssetReader using the -[AVAssetReader addOutput:] method. No actual sample data can be extracted using this class. The location of the sample data is described by the kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_SampleReferenceURL and kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_SampleReferenceByteOffset attachments on the extracted sample buffers. More information about sample buffers describing sample references can be found in the CMSampleBuffer documentation.
 
	Sample buffers extracted using this class can also be appended to an AVAssetWriterInput to create movie tracks that are not self-contained and reference data in the original file instead.  Currently, only instances of AVAssetWriter configured to write files of type AVFileTypeQuickTimeMovie can be used to write tracks that are not self-contained.
 
	Since no sample data is ever returned by instances of AVAssetReaderSampleReferenceOutput, the value of the alwaysCopiesSampleData property is ignored.

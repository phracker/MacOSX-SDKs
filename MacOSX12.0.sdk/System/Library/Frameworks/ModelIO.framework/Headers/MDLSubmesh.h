 @abstract A buffer of 8 bit unsigned integer values, where each entry corresponds
 to the number of vertices making up a face.
 
 @discussion A submesh containing two triangles, a four sided polygon, and a
 line, would contain the data 3 3 4 2.
 If geometryType is of a fixed type, such as triangles, the buffer
 is optional, and will be created on demand if read.
 
 Indices to the vertex buffer will be stored in the index buffer
 correspondingly. In the example above, the indices would be stored
 in order, three indices for the first triangle, followed by three
 for the second, followed by four for the polygon, and finally two
 indices for the line.

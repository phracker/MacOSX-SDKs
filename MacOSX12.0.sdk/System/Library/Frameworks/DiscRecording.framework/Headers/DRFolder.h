	@abstract	Folder objects used in filesystem creation.
	@discussion	A @link DRFolder DRFolder @/link object is a subclass of @link //apple_ref/occ/cl/DRFSObject DRFSObject @/link and represents a folder on the 
				finished disc. DRFolders can be either a &ldquo;real&rdquo; folder pointing to an existing folder 
				(residing on a hard drive for example) or can be a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; folder which exists
				only on the resulting burned disc. 
				A DRFolder pointing to an existing folder cannot have it's 
				contents changed - only those files/folders which are children of the actual folder on disk will 
				be included on the resulting disc. Virtual folders are entirely created 
				programatically and any virtual folder structure can exist and be burned 
				to disc. It is possible to convert a real folder to a virtual folder 
				using the @link //apple_ref/occ/intm/DRFolder/makeVirtual makeVirtual @/link method.

 @header There are two types of request handlers: VNSequenceRequestHandler and VNImageRequestHandler.
 
 Each of them are for scheduling one or more @link VNRequest @/link objects for processing. The type of request may dictate which kind of request handler to use. Some VNRequests can be used with both, while others can only be used with a specific one. Please refer to the documentation of the specific request. The general distinction between the two is that requests that are specific to an image (or buffer) would use the VNImageRequestHandler. For requests that span over multiple image buffers the VNSequenceRequestHandler will hold on to past request data to allow algorithms to work on multiple buffers in a sequence, and that sequence can be dynamic.

 @brief VNImageOptionCameraIntrinsics  Specifies the camera intrinsics as an NSData or CFData representing a matrix_float3x3. See kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_CameraIntrinsicMatrix for details
 @discussion
     Camera intrinsic matrix is a CFData containing a matrix_float3x3, which is column-major. It has the following contents:
     fx	0	ox
     0	fy	oy
     0	0	1
     fx and fy are the focal length in pixels. For square pixels, they will have the same value.
     ox and oy are the coordinates of the principal point. The origin is the upper left of the frame.
 @note When using a CMSampleBuffer as an input and that sample buffer has camera intrinsics attached to it, Vision will use the camera intrinsic from there unless overwritten by passing in as an explicit option which will take precedence.

This option is helpful when the passed in CIImage is the result of a CIFilter chain that has been executed on a CIContext or uses outputs of a CIImage on a given CIContext as they don't have to transfer to other contexts.

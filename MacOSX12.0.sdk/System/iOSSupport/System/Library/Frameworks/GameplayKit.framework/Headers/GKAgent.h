/**
 * An agent is a point mass whose local coordinate system is aligned to its velocity.  Agents have a variety of
 * steering functions that can be used to simulate vehicles or entities with agency.
 * The units of mass, velocity and radius are dimensionless but related. The visual representation of these values
 * are specific to each game's own situation.
 *
 * @discussion Values close to 1.0 should be canonical and are expected to yield pleasing results. When applied to visuals
 * these values should be scaled and biased into their target coordinate system and a simple filter on top ensures
 * any noise generated from the steering logic doesn't affect the visual represtentation.

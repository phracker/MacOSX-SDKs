 HKWorkoutRoute.     If no series data was added, then workoutRoute will be nil and an error returned. The

                     types are NSString, NSDate, NSNumber and HKQuantity
 @param completion   The completion callback handler returns the saved HKWorkoutRoute object. If workoutRoute is nil, an
                     error will indicate why the series could not be returned including database inaccessibility during

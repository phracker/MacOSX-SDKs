 @class         HKWorkoutBuilder
 @discussion    An HKWorkoutBuilder is used to incrementally create new workouts in the HealthKit database. Samples,
                events, and metadata may be added to a builder either during a live workout session or to create a
                workout that occurred in the past. Calling finishWorkoutWithCompletion: will create a new workout
                with samples, events, and metadata that have been provided.

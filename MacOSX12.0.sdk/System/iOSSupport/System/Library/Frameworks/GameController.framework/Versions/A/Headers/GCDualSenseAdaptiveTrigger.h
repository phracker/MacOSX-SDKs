 DualSense triggers are required to be analog inputs. Common uses would be acceleration and decelleration in a driving game for example.
 
 GCDualSenseAdaptiveTrigger respresents an adaptive trigger on the Sony DualSense controller, allowing you to specify a dynamic resistance force
 that is applied when pulling the trigger. This can, for example, be used to emulate the feeling of pulling back a bow string, firing a weapon, or pulling a lever.

'\" The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
'\" manual entries.
'\"
'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"
'\" .VE
'\"	End of vertical sidebar.
'\"
'\" .DS
'\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .DE
'\"	End of indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .SO
'\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
'\"	the option's class in the option database.
'\"
'\" .UL arg1 arg2
'\"	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This package provides commands to parse text written in the
\fIdoctoc\fR markup language and convert it into the canonical
serialization of the table of contents encoded in the text.
See the section \fBToC serialization format\fR for specification
of their format.
.PP
This is an internal package of doctools, for use by the higher level
packages handling \fIdoctoc\fR documents.
.SH API
.TP
\fB::doctools::toc::parse\fR \fBtext\fR \fItext\fR
The command takes the string contained in \fItext\fR and parses it
under the assumption that it contains a document written using the
\fIdoctoc\fR markup language. An error is thrown if this assumption
is found to be false. The format of these errors is described in
section \fBParse errors\fR.
.sp
When successful the command returns the canonical serialization of the
table of contents which was encoded in the text.
See the section \fBToC serialization format\fR for specification
of that format.
.TP
\fB::doctools::toc::parse\fR \fBfile\fR \fIpath\fR
The same as \fBtext\fR, except that the text to parse is read from
the file specified by \fIpath\fR.
.TP
\fB::doctools::toc::parse\fR \fBincludes\fR
This method returns the current list of search paths used when looking
for include files.
.TP
\fB::doctools::toc::parse\fR \fBinclude add\fR \fIpath\fR
This method adds the \fIpath\fR to the list of paths searched when
looking for an include file. The call is ignored if the path is
already in the list of paths. The method returns the empty string as
its result.
.TP
\fB::doctools::toc::parse\fR \fBinclude remove\fR \fIpath\fR
This method removes the \fIpath\fR from the list of paths searched
when looking for an include file. The call is ignored if the path is
not contained in the list of paths. The method returns the empty
string as its result.
.TP
\fB::doctools::toc::parse\fR \fBinclude clear\fR
This method clears the list of search paths for include files.
.TP
\fB::doctools::toc::parse\fR \fBvars\fR
This method returns a dictionary containing the current set of
predefined variables known to the \fBvset\fR markup command during
processing.
.TP
\fB::doctools::toc::parse\fR \fBvar set\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
This method adds the variable \fIname\fR to the set of predefined
variables known to the \fBvset\fR markup command during processing,
and gives it the specified \fIvalue\fR. The method returns the empty
string as its result.
.TP
\fB::doctools::toc::parse\fR \fBvar unset\fR \fIname\fR
This method removes the variable \fIname\fR from the set of predefined
variables known to the \fBvset\fR markup command during
processing. The method returns the empty string as its result.
.TP
\fB::doctools::toc::parse\fR \fBvar clear\fR ?\fIpattern\fR?
This method removes all variables matching the \fIpattern\fR from the
set of predefined variables known to the \fBvset\fR markup command
during processing. The method returns the empty string as its result.
.sp
The pattern matching is done with \fBstring match\fR, and the
default pattern used when none is specified, is \fB*\fR.
.PP
.SH "PARSE ERRORS"
The format of the parse error messages thrown when encountering
violations of the \fIdoctoc\fR markup syntax is human readable and
not intended for processing by machines. As such it is not documented.
.PP
\fIHowever\fR, the errorCode attached to the message is
machine-readable and has the following format:
.IP [1]
The error code will be a list, each element describing a single error
found in the input. The list has at least one element, possibly more.
.IP [2]
Each error element will be a list containing six strings describing an
error in detail. The strings will be
.RS
.IP [1]
The path of the file the error occured in. This may be empty.
.IP [2]
The range of the token the error was found at. This range is a
two-element list containing the offset of the first and last character
in the range, counted from the beginning of the input (file). Offsets
are counted from zero.
.IP [3]
The line the first character after the error is on.
Lines are counted from one.
.IP [4]
The column the first character after the error is at.
Columns are counted from zero.
.IP [5]
The message code of the error. This value can be used as argument to
\fBmsgcat::mc\fR to obtain a localized error message, assuming that
the application had a suitable call of \fBdoctools::msgcat::init\fR to
initialize the necessary message catalogs (See package
\fBdoctools::msgcat\fR).
.IP [6]
A list of details for the error, like the markup command involved. In
the case of message code \fBdoctoc/include/syntax\fR this value is
the set of errors found in the included file, using the format
described here.
.RE
.PP
.SH "[DOCTOC] NOTATION OF TABLES OF CONTENTS"
The doctoc format for tables of contents, also called the
\fIdoctoc markup language\fR, is too large to be covered in single
section.
The interested reader should start with the document
.IP [1]
\fIdoctoc language introduction\fR
.PP
and then proceed from there to the formal specifications, i.e. the
documents
.IP [1]
\fIdoctoc language syntax\fR and
.IP [2]
\fIdoctoc language command reference\fR.
.PP
to get a thorough understanding of the language.
.SH "TOC SERIALIZATION FORMAT"
Here we specify the format used by the doctools v2 packages to
serialize tables of contents as immutable values for transport,
comparison, etc.
.PP
We distinguish between \fIregular\fR and \fIcanonical\fR
serializations.
While a table of contents may have more than one regular serialization
only exactly one of them will be \fIcanonical\fR.
.PP
.TP
regular serialization
.RS
.IP [1]
The serialization of any table of contents is a nested Tcl dictionary.
.IP [2]
This dictionary holds a single key, \fBdoctools::toc\fR, and its
value. This value holds the contents of the table of contents.
.IP [3]
The contents of the table of contents are a Tcl dictionary holding the
title of the table of contents, a label, and its elements. The
relevant keys and their values are
.RS
.TP
\fBtitle\fR
The value is a string containing the title of the table of contents.
.TP
\fBlabel\fR
The value is a string containing a label for the table of contents.
.TP
\fBitems\fR
The value is a Tcl list holding the elements of the table, in the
order they are to be shown.
.sp
Each element is a Tcl list holding the type of the item, and its
description, in this order. An alternative description would be that
it is a Tcl dictionary holding a single key, the item type, mapped to
the item description.
.sp
The two legal item types and their descriptions are
.RS
.TP
\fBreference\fR
This item describes a single entry in the table of contents,
referencing a single document.
To this end its value is a Tcl dictionary containing an id for the
referenced document, a label, and a longer textual description which
can be associated with the entry.
The relevant keys and their values are
.RS
.TP
\fBid\fR
The value is a string containing the id of the document associated
with the entry.
.TP
\fBlabel\fR
The value is a string containing a label for this entry. This string
also identifies the entry, and no two entries (references and
divisions) in the containing list are allowed to have the same label.
.TP
\fBdesc\fR
The value is a string containing a longer description for this entry.
.RE
.TP
\fBdivision\fR
This item describes a group of entries in the table of contents,
inducing a hierarchy of entries.
To this end its value is a Tcl dictionary containing a label for the
group, an optional id to a document for the whole group, and the list
of entries in the group.
The relevant keys and their values are
.RS
.TP
\fBid\fR
The value is a string containing the id of the document associated
with the whole group. This key is optional.
.TP
\fBlabel\fR
The value is a string containing a label for the group. This string
also identifies the entry, and no two entries (references and
divisions) in the containing list are allowed to have the same label.
.TP
\fBitems\fR
The value is a Tcl list holding the elements of the group, in the
order they are to be shown.
This list has the same structure as the value for the keyword
\fBitems\fR used to describe the whole table of contents, see
above. This closes the recusrive definition of the structure, with
divisions holding the same type of elements as the whole table of
contents, including other divisions.
.RE

.RE
.TP
canonical serialization
The canonical serialization of a table of contents has the format as
specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies the
constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
serializations of this table of contents.
.RS
.IP [1]
The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in
ascending dictionary order, as generated by Tcl's builtin command
\fBlsort -increasing -dict\fR.

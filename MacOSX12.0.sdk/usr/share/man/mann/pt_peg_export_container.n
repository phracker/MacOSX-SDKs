.SH NAME
pt::peg::export::container \- PEG Export Plugin. Write CONTAINER format
.SH SYNOPSIS
package require \fBTcl  8.5\fR
.sp
package require \fBpt::peg::export::container  ?1?\fR
.sp
package require \fBpt::peg::to::container \fR
.sp
\fBexport\fR \fIserial\fR \fIconfiguration\fR
.sp
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Are you lost ?
Do you have trouble understanding this document ?
In that case please read the overview provided by the
\fIIntroduction to Parser Tools\fR. This document is the
entrypoint to the whole system the current package is a part of.
.PP
This package implements the parsing expression grammar export plugin
for the generation of CONTAINER markup.
.PP
It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools and
is intended to be used by \fBpt::peg::export\fR, the export
manager, sitting between it and the corresponding core conversion
functionality provided by \fBpt::peg::to::container\fR.
.PP
IMAGE: arch_core_eplugins
.PP
.PP
While the direct use of this package with a regular interpreter is
possible, this is strongly disrecommended and requires a number of
contortions to provide the expected environment.
The proper way to use this functionality depends on the situation:
.IP [1]
In an untrusted environment the proper access is through the package
\fBpt::peg::export\fR and the export manager objects it
provides.
.IP [2]
In a trusted environment however simply use the package
\fBpt::peg::to::container\fR and access the core
conversion functionality directly.
.PP
.SH API
The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the
Plugin API found in the \fIParser Tools Export API\fR
specification.
.TP
\fBexport\fR \fIserial\fR \fIconfiguration\fR
This command takes the canonical serialization of a parsing expression
grammar, as specified in section \fBPEG serialization format\fR,
and contained in \fIserial\fR, the \fIconfiguration\fR, a dictionary,
and generates CONTAINER markup encoding the grammar.
The created string is then returned as the result of the command.
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION
The CONTAINER export plugin recognizes the following configuration
variables and changes its behaviour as they specify.
.TP
enum \fImode\fR
The value of this configuration variable controls which methods of
\fBpt::peg\fR instances the plugin will use to specify the
grammar. There are two legal values
.RS
.TP
\fBbulk\fR
In this mode the methods \fBstart\fR, \fBadd\fR, \fBmodes\fR,
and \fBrules\fR are used to specify the grammar in a bulk manner,
i.e. as a set of nonterminal symbols, and two dictionaries mapping
from the symbols to their semantic modes and parsing expressions.
.sp
This mode is the default.
.TP
\fBincremental\fR
In this mode the methods \fBstart\fR, \fBadd\fR, \fBmode\fR,
and \fBrule\fR are used to specify the grammar piecemal, with each
nonterminal having its own block of defining commands.
.RE
.TP
string \fItemplate\fR
If this configuration variable is set it is assumed to contain a
string into which to put the generated code and other configuration
data. The various locations are expected to be specified with the
following placeholders:
.RS
.TP
\fB@user@\fR
To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable \fBuser\fR.
.TP
\fB@format@\fR
To be replaced with the the constant \fBCONTAINER\fR.
.TP
\fB@file@\fR
To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable \fBfile\fR.
.TP
\fB@name@\fR
To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable \fBname\fR.
.TP
\fB@mode@\fR
To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable \fBmode\fR.
.TP
\fB@code@\fR
To be replaced with the generated code.
.RE
.sp
If this configuration variable is not set, or empty, then the plugin
falls back to a standard template, which is defined as "\fB@code@\fR".
.PP
\fINote\fR that this plugin may ignore the standard configuration
variables \fBuser\fR, \fBformat\fR, \fBfile\fR, and their values,
depending on the chosen template.
.PP
The content of the standard configuration variable \fBname\fR, if set,
is used as name of the grammar in the output. Otherwise the plugin
falls back to the default name \fBa_pe_grammar\fR.
.SH "GRAMMAR CONTAINER"
The \fBcontainer\fR format is another form of describing parsing
expression grammars. While data in this format is executable it does
not constitute a parser for the grammar. It always has to be used in
conjunction with the package \fBpt::peg::interp\fR, a grammar
interpreter.
.PP
The format represents grammars by a \fBsnit::type\fR, i.e. class,
whose instances are API-compatible to the instances of the
\fBpt::peg::container\fR package, and which are preloaded with the
grammar in question.
.PP
It has no direct formal specification beyond what was said above.

.SH "PEG SERIALIZATION FORMAT"
Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize
Parsing Expression Grammars as immutable values for transport,
comparison, etc.
.PP
We distinguish between \fIregular\fR and \fIcanonical\fR
serializations.
While a PEG may have more than one regular serialization only exactly
one of them will be \fIcanonical\fR.
.TP
regular serialization
.RS
.IP [1]
The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.
.IP [2]
This dictionary holds a single key, \fBpt::grammar::peg\fR, and its
value. This value holds the contents of the grammar.
.IP [3]
The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding the set of
nonterminal symbols and the starting expression. The relevant keys and
their values are
.RS
.TP
\fBrules\fR
The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the names of the
nonterminal symbols known to the grammar.
.RS
.IP [1]
Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.
.IP [2]
The empty string is not a legal nonterminal symbol.
.IP [3]
The value for each symbol is a Tcl dictionary itself. The relevant
keys and their values in this dictionary are
.RS
.TP
\fBis\fR
The value is the serialization of the parsing expression describing
the symbols sentennial structure, as specified in the section
\fBPE serialization format\fR.
.TP
\fBmode\fR
The value can be one of three values specifying how a parser should
handle the semantic value produced by the symbol.
.RS
.TP
\fBvalue\fR
The semantic value of the nonterminal symbol is an abstract syntax
tree consisting of a single node node for the nonterminal itself,
which has the ASTs of the symbol's right hand side as its children.
.TP
\fBleaf\fR
The semantic value of the nonterminal symbol is an abstract syntax
tree consisting of a single node node for the nonterminal, without any
children. Any ASTs generated by the symbol's right hand side are
discarded.
.TP
\fBvoid\fR
The nonterminal has no semantic value. Any ASTs generated by the
symbol's right hand side are discarded (as well).
.RE
.RE
.RE
.TP
\fBstart\fR
The value is the serialization of the start parsing expression of the
grammar, as specified in the section \fBPE serialization format\fR.
.RE
.IP [4]
The terminal symbols of the grammar are specified implicitly as the
set of all terminal symbols used in the start expression and on the
RHS of the grammar rules.
.RE
.TP
canonical serialization
The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as specified
in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies the constraints
below, which make it unique among all the possible serializations of
this grammar.
.RS
.IP [1]
The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in
ascending dictionary order, as generated by Tcl's builtin command
\fBlsort -increasing -dict\fR.
.IP [2]
The string representation of the value is the canonical representation
of a Tcl dictionary. I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies the
constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
serializations of this parsing expression.
.RS
.IP [1]
The string representation of the value is the canonical representation
of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.
.IP [2]
Terminals are \fInot\fR encoded as ranges (where start and end of the
range are identical).

.SS EXAMPLE
Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the
rule
.PP
.nf

    Expression <- '(' Expression ')'
                / Factor (MulOp Factor)*

.fi
.PP
then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is
.PP
.nf

    {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}}

.fi

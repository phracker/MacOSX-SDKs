'\" The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
'\" manual entries.
'\"
'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"
'\" .VE
'\"	End of vertical sidebar.
'\"
'\" .DS
'\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .DE
'\"	End of indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .SO
'\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
'\"	the option's class in the option database.
'\"
'\" .UL arg1 arg2
'\"	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

.SH NAME
doctools_lang_intro \- doctools language introduction
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This document is an informal introduction to version 1 of the doctools
markup language based on a multitude of examples. After reading this a
writer should be ready to understand the two parts of the formal
specification, i.e. the \fIdoctools language syntax\fR specification
and the \fIdoctools language command reference\fR.
.SS FUNDAMENTALS
In the broadest terms possible the \fIdoctools markup language\fR
is LaTeX-like, instead of like SGML and similar languages. A document
written in this language consists primarily of text, with markup
commands embedded into it.
.PP
Each markup command is a Tcl command surrounded by a matching pair of
\fB[\fR and \fB]\fR. Inside of these delimiters the usual
rules for a Tcl command apply with regard to word quotation, nested
commands, continuation lines, etc. I.e.
.PP
.nf

  ... [list_begin enumerated] ...

.fi
.nf

  ... [call [cmd foo] \\\\
          [arg bar]] ...

.fi
.nf

  ... [term {complex concept}] ...

.fi
.nf

  ... [opt "[arg key] [arg value]"] ...

.fi
.SS "BASIC STRUCTURE"
The most simple document which can be written in doctools is
.nf

    [manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
    [description]
    [manpage_end]

.fi
This also shows us that all doctools documents are split into two
parts, the \fIheader\fR and the \fIbody\fR. Everything coming before
[\fBdescription\fR] belongs to the header, and everything coming
after belongs to the body, with the whole document bracketed by the
two \fBmanpage_*\fR commands. Before and after these opening and
closing commands we have only \fIwhitespace\fR.
.PP
In the remainder of this section we will discuss only the contents of
the header, the structure of the body will be discussed in the section
\fBText structure\fR.
.PP
The header section can be empty, and otherwise may contain only an
arbitrary sequence of the four so-called \fIheader\fR commands, plus
\fIwhitespace\fR. These commands are
.TP
\fBtitledesc\fR
.TP
\fBmoddesc\fR
.TP
\fBrequire\fR
.TP
\fBcopyright\fR
.PP
They provide, through their arguments, additional information about
the document, like its title, the title of the larger group the
document belongs to (if applicable), the requirements of the
documented packages (if applicable), and copyright assignments. All of
them can occur multiple times, including none, and they can be used in
any order.
However for \fBtitledesc\fR and \fBmoddesc\fR only the last occurrence
is taken. For the other two the specified information is accumulated,
in the given order. Regular text is not allowed within the header.
.PP
Given the above a less minimal example of a document is
.nf

[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[\fBcopyright {YEAR AUTHOR}\fR]
[\fBtitledesc TITLE\fR]
[\fBmoddesc   MODULE_TITLE\fR]
[\fBrequire   PACKAGE VERSION\fR]
[\fBrequire   PACKAGE\fR]
[description]
[manpage_end]

.fi
Remember that the whitespace is optional. The document
.nf

    [manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
    [copyright {YEAR AUTHOR}][titledesc TITLE][moddesc MODULE_TITLE]
    [require PACKAGE VERSION][require PACKAGE][description]
    [manpage_end]

.fi
has the same meaning as the example before.
.PP
On the other hand, if \fIwhitespace\fR is present it consists not
only of any sequence of characters containing the space character,
horizontal and vertical tabs, carriage return, and newline, but it may
contain comment markup as well, in the form of the \fBcomment\fR
command.
.nf

[\fBcomment { ... }\fR]
[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[copyright {YEAR AUTHOR}]
[titledesc TITLE]
[moddesc   MODULE_TITLE][\fBcomment { ... }\fR]
[require   PACKAGE VERSION]
[require   PACKAGE]
[description]
[manpage_end]
[\fBcomment { ... }\fR]

.fi
.SS "ADVANCED STRUCTURE"
In the simple examples of the last section we fudged a bit regarding
the markup actually allowed to be used before the \fBmanpage_begin\fR
command opening the document.
.PP
Instead of only whitespace the two templating commands \fBinclude\fR
and \fBvset\fR are also allowed, to enable the writer to either set
and/or import configuration settings relevant to the document. I.e. it
is possible to write
.nf

[\fBinclude FILE\fR]
[\fBvset VAR VALUE\fR]
[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[description]
[manpage_end]

.fi
Even more important, these two commands are allowed anywhere where a
markup command is allowed, without regard for any other
structure. I.e. for example in the header as well.
.nf

[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[\fBinclude FILE\fR]
[\fBvset VAR VALUE\fR]
[description]
[manpage_end]

.fi
The only restriction \fBinclude\fR has to obey is that the contents of
the included file must be valid at the place of the inclusion. I.e. a
file included before \fBmanpage_begin\fR may contain only the
templating commands \fBvset\fR and \fBinclude\fR, a file included in
the header may contain only header commands, etc.
.SS "TEXT STRUCTURE"
The body of the document consists mainly of text, possibly split into
sections, subsections, and paragraphs, with parts marked up to
highlight various semantic categories of text, and additional
structure through the use of examples and (nested) lists.
.PP
This section explains the high-level structural commands, with
everything else deferred to the following sections.
.PP
The simplest way of structuring the body is through the introduction
of paragraphs. The command for doing so is \fBpara\fR. Each occurrence
of this command closes the previous paragraph and automatically opens
the next. The first paragraph is automatically opened at the beginning
of the body, by \fBdescription\fR. In the same manner the last
paragraph automatically ends at \fBmanpage_end\fR.
.nf

[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[description]
 ...
[\fBpara\fR]
 ...
[\fBpara\fR]
 ...
[manpage_end]

.fi
Empty paragraphs are ignored.
.PP
A structure coarser than paragraphs are sections, which allow the
writer to split a document into larger, and labeled, pieces. The
command for doing so is \fBsection\fR. Each occurrence of this command
closes the previous section and automatically opens the next,
including its first paragraph. The first section is automatically
opened at the beginning of the body, by \fBdescription\fR (This
section is labeled "DESCRIPTION"). In the same manner the last section
automatically ends at \fBmanpage_end\fR.
.PP
Empty sections are \fInot\fR ignored. We are free to (not) use
paragraphs within sections.
.nf

[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[description]
 ...
[\fBsection {Section A}\fR]
 ...
[para]
 ...
[\fBsection {Section B}\fR]
 ...
[manpage_end]

.fi
Between sections and paragraphs we have subsections, to split sections.
The command for doing so is \fBsubsection\fR. Each occurrence of this
command closes the previous subsection and automatically opens the
next, including its first paragraph. A subsection is automatically
opened at the beginning of the body, by \fBdescription\fR, and at the
beginning of each section. In the same manner the last subsection
automatically ends at \fBmanpage_end\fR.
.PP
Empty subsections are \fInot\fR ignored. We are free to (not) use
paragraphs within subsections.
.nf

[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[description]
 ...
[section {Section A}]
 ...
[\fBsubsection {Sub 1}\fR]
 ...
[para]
 ...
[\fBsubsection {Sub 2}\fR]
 ...
[section {Section B}]
 ...
[manpage_end]

.fi
.SS "TEXT MARKUP"
Having handled the overall structure a writer can impose on the
document we now take a closer at the text in a paragraph.
.PP
While most often this is just the unadorned content of the document we
do have situations where we wish to highlight parts of it as some type
of thing or other, like command arguments, command names, concepts,
uris, etc.
.PP
For this we have a series of markup commands which take the text to
highlight as their single argument. It should be noted that while
their predominant use is the highlighting of parts of a paragraph they
can also be used to mark up the arguments of list item commands, and
of other markup commands.
.PP
The commands available to us are
.TP
\fBarg\fR
Its argument is a the name of a command argument.
.TP
\fBclass\fR
Its argument is a class name.
.TP
\fBcmd\fR
Its argument is a command name (Tcl command).
.TP
\fBconst\fR
Its argument is a constant.
.TP
\fBemph\fR
General, non-semantic emphasis.
.TP
\fBfile\fR
Its argument is a filename / path.
.TP
\fBfun\fR
Its argument is a function name.
.TP
\fBmethod\fR
Its argument is a method name
.TP
\fBnamespace\fR
Its argument is namespace name.
.TP
\fBopt\fR
Its argument is some optional syntax element.
.TP
\fBoption\fR
Its argument is a command line switch / widget option.
.TP
\fBpackage\fR
Its argument is a package name.
.TP
\fBsectref\fR
Its argument is the title of a section or subsection,
i.e. a section reference.
.TP
\fBsyscmd\fR
Its argument is a command name (external, system command).
.TP
\fBterm\fR
Its argument is a concept, or general terminology.
.TP
\fBtype\fR
Its argument is a type name.
.TP
\fBuri\fR
Its argument is a uniform resource identifier, i.e an
external reference. A second argument can be used
to specify an explicit label for the reference in
question.
.TP
\fBusage\fR
The arguments describe the syntax of a Tcl command.
.TP
\fBvar\fR
Its argument is a variable.
.TP
\fBwidget\fR
Its argument is a widget name.
.PP
The example demonstrating the use of text markup is an excerpt from
the \fIdoctools language command reference\fR, with some
highlighting added.
It shows their use within a block of text, as the arguments of a list
item command (\fBcall\fR), and our ability to nest them.
.nf

  ...
  [call [\fBcmd arg_def\fR] [\fBarg type\fR] [\fBarg name\fR]] [\fBopt\fR [\fBarg mode\fR]]]

  Text structure. List element. Argument list. Automatically closes the
  previous list element. Specifies the data-[\fBarg type\fR] of the described
  argument of a command, its [\fBarg name\fR] and its i/o-[\fBarg mode\fR]. The
  latter is optional.
  ...

.fi
.SS ESCAPES
Beyond the 20 commands for simple markup shown in the previous section
we have two more available which are technically simple markup.
However their function is not the marking up of phrases as specific
types of things, but the insertion of characters, namely \fB[\fR
and \fB]\fR.
These commands, \fBlb\fR and \fBrb\fR respectively, are required
because our use of [ and ] to bracket markup commands makes it
impossible to directly use [ and ] within the text.
.PP
Our example of their use are the sources of the last sentence in the
previous paragraph, with some highlighting added.
.nf

  ...
  These commands, [cmd lb] and [cmd lb] respectively, are required
  because our use of [\fBlb\fR] and [\fBrb\fR] to bracket markup commands makes it
  impossible to directly use [\fBlb\fR] and [\fBrb\fR] within the text.
  ...

.fi
.SS CROSS-REFERENCES
The last two commands we have to discuss are for the declaration of
cross-references between documents, explicit and implicit. They are
\fBkeywords\fR and \fBsee_also\fR. Both take an arbitrary number of
arguments, all of which have to be plain unmarked text. I.e. it is not
allowed to use markup on them. Both commands can be used multiple
times in a document. If that is done all arguments of all occurrences
of one of them are put together into a single set.
.TP
\fBkeywords\fR
The arguments of this command are interpreted as keywords describing
the document. A processor can use this information to create an index
indirectly linking the containing document to all documents with the
same keywords.
.TP
\fBsee_also\fR
The arguments of this command are interpreted as references to other
documents. A processor can format them as direct links to these
documents.
.PP
.PP
All the cross-reference commands can occur anywhere in the document
between \fBmanpage_begin\fR and \fBmanpage_end\fR. As such the writer
can choose whether she wants to have them at the beginning of the
body, or at its end, maybe near the place a keyword is actually
defined by the main content, or considers them as meta data which
should be in the header, etc.
.PP
Our example shows the sources for the cross-references of this
document, with some highlighting added. Incidentally they are found
at the end of the body.
.nf

  ...
  [\fBsee_also doctools_intro\fR]
  [\fBsee_also doctools_lang_syntax\fR]
  [\fBsee_also doctools_lang_cmdref\fR]
  [\fBkeywords markup {semantic markup}\fR]
  [\fBkeywords {doctools markup} {doctools language}\fR]
  [\fBkeywords {doctools syntax} {doctools commands}\fR]
  [manpage_end]

.fi
.SS EXAMPLES
Where ever we can write plain text we can write examples too. For
simple examples we have the command \fBexample\fR which takes a single
argument, the text of the argument. The example text must not contain
markup. If we wish to have markup within an example we have to use the
2-command combination \fBexample_begin\fR / \fBexample_end\fR instead.
.PP
The first opens an example block, the other closes it, and in between
we can write plain text and use all the regular text markup commands.
Note that text structure commands are not allowed. This also means
that it is not possible to embed examples and lists within an example.
On the other hand, we \fIcan\fR use templating commands within
example blocks to read their contents from a file (Remember section
\fBAdvanced structure\fR).
.PP
The source for the very first example in this document (see section
\fBFundamentals\fR), with some highlighting added, is
.nf

  [\fBexample\fR {
    ... [list_begin enumerated] ...
  }]

.fi
Using \fBexample_begin\fR / \fBexample_end\fR this would look like
.nf

  [\fBexample_begin\fR]
    ... [list_begin enumerated] ...
  [\fBexample_end\fR]

.fi
.SS LISTS
Where ever we can write plain text we can write lists too. The main
commands are \fBlist_begin\fR to start a list, and \fBlist_end\fR to
close one. The opening command takes an argument specifying the type
of list started it, and this in turn determines which of the eight
existing list item commands are allowed within the list to start list
items.
.PP
After the opening command only whitespace is allowed, until the first
list item command opens the first item of the list. Each item is a
regular series of paragraphs and is closed by either the next list
item command, or the end of the list. If closed by a list item command
this command automatically opens the next list item. A consequence of
a list item being a series of paragraphs is that all regular text
markup can be used within a list item, including examples and other
lists.
.PP
The list types recognized by \fBlist_begin\fR and their associated
list item commands are:
.TP
\fBarguments\fR
(\fBarg_def\fR) This opens an \fIargument (declaration) list\fR. It
is a specialized form of a term definition list where the term is an
argument name, with its type and i/o-mode.
.TP
\fBcommands\fR
(\fBcmd_def\fR) This opens a \fIcommand (declaration) list\fR. It
is a specialized form of a term definition list where the term is a
command name.
.TP
\fBdefinitions\fR
(\fBdef\fR and \fBcall\fR) This opens a general
\fIterm definition list\fR. The terms defined by the list items are
specified through the argument(s) of the list item commands, either
general terms, possibly with markup (\fBdef\fR), or Tcl commands with
their syntax (\fBcall\fR).
.TP
\fBenumerated\fR
(\fBenum\fR) This opens a general \fIenumerated list\fR.
.TP
\fBitemized\fR
(\fBitem\fR)
This opens a general \fIitemized list\fR.
.TP
\fBoptions\fR
(\fBopt_def\fR) This opens an \fIoption (declaration) list\fR. It
is a specialized form of a term definition list where the term is an
option name, possibly with the option's arguments.
.TP
\fBtkoptions\fR
(\fBtkoption_def\fR) This opens a
\fIwidget option (declaration) list\fR. It is a specialized form of
a term definition list where the term is the name of a configuration
option for a widget, with its name and class in the option database.
.PP
Our example is the source of the definition list in the previous
paragraph, with most of the content in the middle removed.
.nf

  ...
  [\fBlist_begin\fR definitions]
  [\fBdef\fR [const arg]]

  ([cmd arg_def]) This opens an argument (declaration) list. It is a
  specialized form of a definition list where the term is an argument
  name, with its type and i/o-mode.

  [\fBdef\fR [const itemized]]

  ([cmd item])
  This opens a general itemized list.

  ...
  [\fBdef\fR [const tkoption]]

  ([cmd tkoption_def]) This opens a widget option (declaration) list. It
  is a specialized form of a definition list where the term is the name
  of a configuration option for a widget, with its name and class in the
  option database.

  [\fBlist_end\fR]
  ...

.fi
Note that a list cannot begin in one (sub)section and end in
another. Differently said, (sub)section breaks are not allowed within
lists and list items. An example of this \fIillegal\fR construct is
.nf

  ...
  [list_begin itemized]
  [item]
  ...
  [\fBsection {ILLEGAL WITHIN THE LIST}\fR]
  ...
  [list_end]
  ...

.fi
.SH "FURTHER READING"
Now that this document has been digested the reader, assumed to be a
\fIwriter\fR of documentation should be fortified enough to be able
to understand the formal \fIdoctools language syntax\fR
specification as well. From here on out the
\fIdoctools language command reference\fR will also serve as the
detailed specification and cheat sheet for all available commands and
their syntax.
.PP
To be able to validate a document while writing it, it is also
recommended to familiarize oneself with one of the applications for
the processing and conversion of doctools documents, i.e. either
Tcllib's easy and simple \fBdtplite\fR, or Tclapps'
ultra-configurable \fBdtp\fR.
.SH "BUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK"
This document, will undoubtedly contain bugs and other problems.
Please report such in the category \fIdoctools\fR of the
\fITcllib SF Trackers\fR [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].
Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have.

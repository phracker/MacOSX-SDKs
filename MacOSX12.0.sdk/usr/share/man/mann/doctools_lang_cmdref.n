'\"
'\" The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
'\" manual entries.
'\"
'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"
'\" .VE
'\"	End of vertical sidebar.
'\"
'\" .DS
'\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .DE
'\"	End of indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .SO
'\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
'\"	the option's class in the option database.
'\"
'\" .UL arg1 arg2
'\"	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This document specifies both names and syntax of all the commands
which together are the doctools markup language, version 1.
As this document is intended to be a reference the commands are listed
in alphabetical order, and the descriptions are relatively short.
A beginner should read the much more informally written
\fIdoctools language introduction\fR first.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fBarg\fR \fItext\fR
Text markup. The argument text is marked up as the \fIargument\fR of
a command. Main uses are the highlighting of command arguments in
free-form text, and for the argument parameters of the markup commands
\fBcall\fR and \fBusage\fR.
.TP
\fBarg_def\fR \fItype\fR \fIname\fR ?\fImode\fR?
Text structure. List element. Argument list. Automatically closes the
previous list element. Specifies the data-\fItype\fR of the described
argument of a command, its \fIname\fR and its i/o-\fImode\fR. The
latter is optional.
.TP
\fBbullet\fR
\fIDeprecated\fR. Text structure. List element. Itemized list. See
\fBitem\fR for the canonical command to open a list item in an
itemized list.
.TP
\fBcall\fR \fIargs\fR
Text structure. List element. Definition list. Automatically closes
the previous list element. Defines the term as a command and its
arguments.
The first argument is the name of the command described by the
following free-form text, and all arguments coming after that are
descriptions of the command's arguments.
It is expected that the arguments are marked up with \fBarg\fR,
\fBmethod\fR, \fBoption\fR etc., as is appropriate, and that the
command itself is marked up with \fBcmd\fR.
It is expected that the formatted term is not only printed in place,
but also in the table of contents of the document, or synopsis,
depending on the output format.
.TP
\fBcategory\fR \fItext\fR
Document information. Anywhere. This command registers its plain text
arguments as the category this document belongs to. If this command is
used multiple times the last value specified is used.
.TP
\fBclass\fR \fItext\fR
Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a
\fIclass\fR. The text may have other markup already applied to
it. Main use is the highlighting of class names in free-form text.
.TP
\fBcmd\fR \fItext\fR
Text markup. The argument text is marked up as the name of a
\fITcl command\fR. The text may have other markup already applied
to it. Main uses are the highlighting of commands in free-form text,
and for the command parameters of the markup commands \fBcall\fR and
\fBusage\fR.
.TP
\fBcmd_def\fR \fIcommand\fR
Text structure. List element. Command list. Automatically closes the
previous list element. The argument specifies the name of the
\fITcl command\fR to be described by the list element. Expected to
be marked up in the output as if it had been formatted with \fBcmd\fR.
.TP
\fBcomment\fR \fIplaintext\fR
Text markup. The argument text is marked up as a comment standing
outside of the actual text of the document. Main use is in free-form
text.
.TP
\fBconst\fR \fItext\fR
Text markup. The argument is marked up as a \fIconstant\fR value. The
text may have other markup already applied to it. Main use is the
highlighting of constants in free-form text.
.TP
\fBcopyright\fR \fItext\fR
Document information. Anywhere. The command registers the plain text
argument as a copyright assignment for the manpage. When invoked more
than once the assignments are accumulated.
.TP
\fBdef\fR \fItext\fR
Text structure. List element. Definition list. Automatically closes
the previous list element. The argument text is the term defined by
the new list element. Text markup can be applied to it.
.TP
\fBdescription\fR
Document structure. This command separates the header from the
document body.  Implicitly starts a section named "DESCRIPTION" (See
command \fBsection\fR).
.TP
\fBenum\fR
Text structure. List element. Enumerated list. Automatically closes
the previous list element.
.TP
\fBemph\fR \fItext\fR
Text markup. The argument text is marked up as emphasized. Main use is
for general highlighting of pieces of free-form text without attaching
special meaning to the pieces.
.TP
\fBexample\fR \fItext\fR
Text structure, Text markup. This command marks its argument up as an
\fIexample\fR. Main use is the simple embedding of examples in
free-form text. It should be used if the example does \fInot\fR need
special markup of its own. Otherwise use a sequence of
\fBexample_begin\fR ... \fBexample_end\fR.
.TP
\fBexample_begin\fR
Text structure. This commands starts an example. All text until the
next \fBexample_end\fR belongs to the example. Line breaks, spaces,
and tabs have to be preserved literally. Examples cannot be nested.
.TP
\fBexample_end\fR
Text structure. This command closes the example started by the last
\fBexample_begin\fR.
.TP
\fBfile\fR \fItext\fR
Text markup. The argument is marked up as a \fIfile\fR or
\fIdirectory\fR, i.e. in general a \fIpath\fR. The text may have
other markup already applied to it. Main use is the highlighting of
paths in free-form text.
.TP
\fBfun\fR \fItext\fR
Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a
\fIfunction\fR. The text may have other markup already applied to
it. Main use is the highlighting of function names in free-form text.
.TP
\fBimage\fR \fIname\fR ?\fIlabel\fR?
Text markup. The argument is the symbolic name of an \fIimage\fR
and replaced with the image itself, if a suitable variant is found
by the backend. The second argument, should it be present, will be
interpreted the human-readable description of the image, and put
into the output in a suitable position, if such is supported by the
format. The HTML format, for example, can place it into the \fIalt\fR
attribute of image references.
.TP
\fBinclude\fR \fIfilename\fR
Templating. The contents of the named file are interpreted as text
written in the doctools markup and processed in the place of the
include command. The markup in the file has to be self-contained. It
is not possible for a markup command to cross the file boundaries.
.TP
\fBitem\fR
Text structure. List element. Itemized list. Automatically closes the
previous list element.
.TP
\fBkeywords\fR \fIargs\fR
Document information. Anywhere. This command registers all its plain text
arguments as keywords applying to this document. Each argument is a single
keyword. If this command is used multiple times all the arguments accumulate.
.TP
\fBlb\fR
Text. The command is replaced with a left bracket. Use in free-form text.
Required to avoid interpretation of a left bracket as the start of a markup
command.
.TP
\fBlist_begin\fR \fIwhat\fR
Text structure. This command starts a list. The exact nature of the
list is determined by the argument \fIwhat\fR of the command. This
further determines which commands are have to be used to start the
list elements. Lists can be nested, i.e. it is allowed to start a new
list within a list element.

used in the output, otherwise \fItext\fR is used.
.TP
\fBsectref-external\fR \fItext\fR
Text markup. Like \fBsectref\fR, except that the section is assumed to
be in a different document and therefore doesn't need to be identified,
nor are any checks for existence made. Only the text to format is needed.
.TP
\fBsee_also\fR \fIargs\fR

.TP
\fBtkoption_def\fR \fIname\fR \fIdbname\fR \fIdbclass\fR
Text structure. List element. Widget option list. Automatically closes
the previous list element. Specifies the \fIname\fR of the option as
used in scripts, the name used by the option database (\fIdbname\fR),
and its class (\fIdbclass\fR), i.e. its type. It is expected that the
name is marked up using \fBoption\fR.
.TP
\fBtype\fR \fItext\fR
Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a
\fIdata type\fR. The text may have other markup already applied to

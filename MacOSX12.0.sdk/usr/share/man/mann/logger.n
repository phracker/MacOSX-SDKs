'\" The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
'\" manual entries.
'\"
'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"
'\" .VE
'\"	End of vertical sidebar.
'\"
'\" .DS
'\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .DE
'\"	End of indented unfilled display.

'\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
'\"	the option's class in the option database.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBlogger\fR package provides a flexible system for logging messages
from different services, at priority levels, with different commands.
.PP
To begin using the logger package, we do the following:
.PP
.nf

    package require logger
    set log [logger::init myservice]
    ${log}::notice "Initialized myservice logging"

    ... code ...

    ${log}::notice "Ending myservice logging"
    ${log}::delete

.fi
.PP
In the above code, after the package is loaded, the following things
happen:
.TP
\fBlogger::init\fR \fIservice\fR
Initializes the service \fIservice\fR for logging.  The service names
are actually Tcl namespace names, so they are separated with '::'.
When a logger service is initialized, it "inherits" properties from its
parents.  For instance, if there were a service \fIfoo\fR, and
we did a \fBlogger::init\fR \fIfoo::bar\fR (to create a \fIbar\fR
service underneath \fIfoo\fR), \fIbar\fR would copy the current
configuration of the \fIfoo\fR service, although it would of
course, also be possible to then separately configure \fIbar\fR.
If a logger service is initialized and the parent does not yet exist, the
parent is also created.
The new logger service is initialized with the default loglevel set
with \fBlogger::setlevel\fR.
.TP
\fBlogger::import\fR ?\fB-all\fR? ?\fB-force\fR? ?\fB-prefix\fR \fIprefix\fR? ?\fB-namespace\fR \fInamespace\fR? \fIservice\fR
Import the logger service commands into the current namespace. Without the \fB-all\fR option
only the commands corresponding to the log levels are imported. If \fB-all\fR is given,
all the \fB${log}::cmd\fR style commands are imported. If the import would overwrite a command
an error is returned and no command is imported. Use the \fB-force\fR option to force the import
and overwrite existing commands without complaining.
If the \fB-prefix\fR option is given, the commands are imported with the given \fIprefix\fR
prepended to their names.
If the \fB-namespace\fR option is given, the commands are imported into the given namespace. If the
namespace does not exist, it is created. If a namespace without a leading :: is given, it is interpreted as
a child namespace to the current namespace.
.TP
\fBlogger::initNamespace\fR \fIns\fR ?\fIlevel\fR?
Convenience command for setting up a namespace for logging. Creates a
logger service named after the namespace \fIns\fR (a :: prefix is
stripped), imports all the log commands into the namespace, and sets
the default logging level, either to the specified \fIlevel\fR, or the
default level, "warn".
.TP
\fBlogger::services\fR
Returns a list of all the available services.
.TP
\fBlogger::enable\fR \fIlevel\fR
Globally enables logging at and "above" the given level.  Levels are
\fBdebug\fR, \fBinfo\fR, \fBnotice\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBerror\fR,
\fBcritical\fR, \fBalert\fR, \fBemergency\fR.
.TP
\fBlogger::disable\fR \fIlevel\fR
Globally disables logging at and "below" the given level.  Levels are
those listed above.
.TP
\fBlogger::setlevel\fR \fIlevel\fR
Globally enable logging at and "above" the given level. Levels are those
listed above. This command changes the default loglevel for new loggers
created with \fBlogger::init\fR.
.TP
\fBlogger::levels\fR
Returns a list of the available log levels (also listed above under \fBenable\fR).
.TP
\fBlogger::servicecmd\fR \fIservice\fR
Returns the \fB${log}\fR token created by \fBlogger::init\fR for this service.
.TP
\fB${log}::debug\fR \fImessage\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::info\fR \fImessage\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::notice\fR \fImessage\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::warn\fR \fImessage\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::error\fR \fImessage\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::critical\fR \fImessage\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::alert\fR \fImessage\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::emergency\fR \fImessage\fR
These are the commands called to actually log a message about an
event.  \fB${log}\fR is the variable obtained from \fBlogger::init\fR.
.TP
\fB${log}::setlevel\fR \fIlevel\fR
Enable logging, in the service referenced by \fB${log}\fR, and its
children, at and above the level specified, and disable logging below
it.
.TP
\fB${log}::enable\fR \fIlevel\fR
Enable logging, in the service referenced by \fB${log}\fR, and its
children, at and above the level specified.  Note that this does \fInot\fR disable logging below this level, so you should probably use
\fBsetlevel\fR instead.
.TP
\fB${log}::disable\fR \fIlevel\fR
Disable logging, in the service referenced by \fB${log}\fR, and its
children, at and below the level specified. Note that this does \fInot\fR enable logging above this level,
so you should probably use \fBsetlevel\fR instead.
Disabling the loglevel \fBemergency\fR switches logging off for the service and its children.
.TP
\fB${log}::lvlchangeproc\fR \fIcommand\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::lvlchangeproc\fR
Set the script to call when the log instance in question changes its log level.
If called without a command it returns the currently registered command. The command gets two arguments
appended, the old and the new loglevel. The callback is invoked after all changes have been done.
If child loggers are affected, their callbacks are called before their parents callback.
.nf

 	proc lvlcallback {old new} {
 	    puts "Loglevel changed from $old to $new"
 	}
 	${log}::lvlchangeproc lvlcallback

.fi
.TP
\fB${log}::logproc\fR \fIlevel\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::logproc\fR \fIlevel\fR \fIcommand\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::logproc\fR \fIlevel\fR \fIargname\fR \fIbody\fR
This command comes in three forms - the third, older one is deprecated
and may be removed from future versions of the logger package.
The current set version takes one argument, a command to be executed when the
level is called.  The callback command takes on argument, the text to
be logged. If called only with a valid level \fBlogproc\fR returns the name of the command
currently registered as callback command.
\fBlogproc\fR specifies which command will perform the actual logging
for a given level.  The logger package ships with default commands for
all log levels, but with \fBlogproc\fR it is possible to replace them
with custom code.  This would let you send your logs over the network,
to a database, or anything else.  For example:
.nf

    proc logtoserver {txt} {
        variable socket
        puts $socket "Notice: $txt"
    }

    ${log}::logproc notice logtoserver

.fi
Trace logs are slightly different: instead of a plain text argument,
the argument provided to the logproc is a dictionary consisting of the
\fBenter\fR or \fBleave\fR keyword along with another dictionary of
details about the trace.  These include:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBproc\fR - Name of the procedure being traced.
.IP \(bu
\fBlevel\fR - The stack level for the procedure invocation
(from \fBinfo\fR \fBlevel\fR).
.IP \(bu
\fBscript\fR - The name of the file in which the procedure is
defined, or an empty string if defined in interactive mode.
.IP \(bu
\fBcaller\fR - The name of the procedure calling the procedure
being traced, or an empty string if the procedure was called from the
global scope (stack level 0).
.IP \(bu
\fBprocargs\fR - A dictionary consisting of the names of arguments
to the procedure paired with values given for those arguments (\fBenter\fR
traces only).
.IP \(bu
\fBstatus\fR - The Tcl return code (e.g. \fBok\fR,
\fBcontinue\fR, etc.) (\fBleave\fR traces only).
.IP \(bu
\fBresult\fR - The value returned by the procedure (\fBleave\fR
traces only).
.RE
.TP
\fB${log}::services\fR
Returns a list of the registered logging services which are children of this service.
.TP
\fB${log}::servicename\fR
Returns the name of this service.
.TP
\fB${log}::currentloglevel\fR
Returns the currently enabled log level for this service. If no logging is enabled returns \fBnone\fR.
.TP
\fB${log}::delproc\fR \fIcommand\fR
.TP
\fB${log}::delproc\fR
Set the script to call when the log instance in question is deleted.
If called without a command it returns the currently registered command.
For example:
.nf

    ${log}::delproc [list closesock $logsock]

.fi
.TP
\fB${log}::delete\fR
This command deletes a particular logging service, and its children.
You must call this to clean up the resources used by a service.
.TP
\fB${log}::trace\fR \fIcommand\fR
This command controls logging of enter/leave traces for specified procedures.
It is used to enable and disable tracing, query tracing status, and
specify procedures are to be traced.  Trace handlers are unregistered when
tracing is disabled.  As a result, there is not performance impact to a
library when tracing is disabled, just as with other log level commands.
.nf

  proc tracecmd { dict } {
      puts $dict
  }

  set log [::logger::init example]
  ${log}::logproc trace tracecmd

  proc foo { args } {
      puts "In foo"
      bar 1
      return "foo_result"
  }

  proc bar { x } {
      puts "In bar"
      return "bar_result"
  }

  ${log}::trace add foo bar
  ${log}::trace on

  foo

# Output:
enter {proc ::foo level 1 script {} caller {} procargs {args {}}}
In foo
enter {proc ::bar level 2 script {} caller ::foo procargs {x 1}}
In bar
leave {proc ::bar level 2 script {} caller ::foo status ok result bar_result}
leave {proc ::foo level 1 script {} caller {} status ok result foo_result}

.fi
.TP
\fB${log}::trace\fR \fBon\fR
Turns on trace logging for procedures registered through the \fBtrace\fR
\fBadd\fR command.  This is similar to the \fBenable\fR command for other
logging levels, but allows trace logging to take place at any level.
The trace logging mechanism takes advantage of the execution trace feature
of Tcl 8.4 and later.  The \fBtrace\fR \fBon\fR command will return an
error if called from earlier versions of Tcl.
.TP
\fB${log}::trace\fR \fBoff\fR
Turns off trace logging for procedures registered for trace logging
through the \fBtrace\fR \fBadd\fR command.  This is similar to the
\fBdisable\fR command for other logging levels, but allows trace logging
to take place at any level.
Procedures are not unregistered, so logging for them can be turned back
on with the \fBtrace\fR \fBon\fR command.  There is no overhead imposed
by trace registration when trace logging is disabled.
.TP
\fB${log}::trace\fR \fBstatus\fR ?procName? ?...?
This command returns a list of the procedures currently registered for
trace logging, or a flag indicating whether or not a trace is registered
for one or more specified procedures.
.TP
\fB${log}::trace\fR \fBadd\fR \fIprocName\fR ?...?
.TP
\fB${log}::trace\fR \fBadd\fR ?-ns? \fInsName\fR ?...?
This command registers one or more procedures for logging of entry/exit
traces.  Procedures can be specified via a list of procedure names or
namespace names (in which case all procedure within the namespace
are targeted by the operation).  By default, each name is first
interpreted as a procedure name or glob-style search pattern, and if
not found its interpreted as a namespace name.  The \fI-ns\fR option can
be used to force interpretation of all provided arguments as namespace names.
Procedures must be defined prior to registering them for tracing
through the \fBtrace\fR \fBadd\fR command.  Any procedure or namespace
names/patterns that don't match any existing procedures will be
silently ignored.
.TP
\fB${log}::trace\fR \fBremove\fR \fIprocName\fR ?...?
.TP
\fB${log}::trace\fR \fBremove\fR ?-ns? \fInsName\fR ?...?
This command unregisters one or more procedures so that they will no
longer have trace logging performed, with the same matching rules as
that of the \fBtrace\fR \fBadd\fR command.
.PP
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
The logger package is implemented in such a way as to optimize (for
Tcl 8.4 and newer) log procedures which are disabled.  They are
aliased to a proc which has no body, which is compiled to a no op in
bytecode.  This should make the peformance hit minimal.  If you really
want to pull out all the stops, you can replace the ${log} token in
your code with the actual namespace and command (${log}::warn becomes
::logger::tree::myservice::warn), so that no variable lookup is done.
This puts the performance of disabled logger commands very close to no
logging at all.
.PP
The "object orientation" is done through a hierarchy of namespaces.
Using an actual object oriented system would probably be a better way
of doing things, or at least provide for a cleaner implementation.
.PP
The service "object orientation" is done with namespaces.
.SH "LOGPROCS AND CALLSTACK"
The logger package takes extra care to keep the logproc out of the call stack.
This enables logprocs to execute code in the callers scope by using uplevel or
linking to local variables by using upvar. This may fire traces with all usual
side effects.
.nf

     # Print caller and current vars in the calling proc
     proc log_local_var {txt} {
          set caller [info level -1]
          set vars [uplevel 1 info vars]
          foreach var [lsort $vars] {
             if {[uplevel 1 [list array exists $var]] == 1} {
             	lappend val $var <Array>
             } else {
             	lappend val $var [uplevel 1 [list set $var]]
             }
          }
          puts "$txt"
          puts "Caller: $caller"
          puts "Variables in callers scope:"
          foreach {var value} $val {
          	puts "$var = $value"
          }
     }

     # install as logproc
     ${log}::logproc debug log_local_var

'\"
'\" The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
'\" manual entries.
'\"
'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"
'\" .VE
'\"	End of vertical sidebar.
'\"
'\" .DS
'\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .DE
'\"	End of indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .SO
'\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
'\"	the option's class in the option database.
'\"
'\" .UL arg1 arg2
'\"	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

.SH NAME
grammar::me_ast \- Various representations of ASTs
.SH DESCRIPTION
This document specifies various representations for the
\fIabstract syntax tree\fRs (short \fIAST\fR) generated by
instances of ME virtual machines, independent of variant.
Please go and read the document \fBgrammar::me_intro\fR first if
you do not know what a ME virtual machine is.
.PP
ASTs and all the representations we specify distinguish between two
types of nodes, namely:
.PP
.TP
Terminal
Terminal nodes refer to the terminal symbols found in the token
stream. They are always leaf nodes. I.e. terminal nodes never have
children.
.TP
Nonterminal
Nonterminal nodes represent a nonterminal symbol of the grammar used
during parsing. They can occur as leaf and inner nodes of the
tree.
.PP
.PP
Both types of nodes carry basic range information telling a user which
parts of the input are covered by the node by providing the location
of the first and last tokens found within the range. Locations are
provided as non-negative integer offsets from the beginning of the
token stream, with the first token found in the stream located at
offset 0 (zero).
.PP
The root of an AS tree can be either a terminal or nonterminal node.
.SH "AST VALUES"
This representation of ASTs is a Tcl list. The main list represents
the root node of the tree, with the representations of the children
nested within.
.PP
Each node is represented by a single Tcl list containing three or more
elements. The first element is either the empty string or the name of
a nonterminal symbol (which is never the empty string). The second and
third elements are then the locations of the first and last tokens.
Any additional elements after the third are then the representations
of the children, with the leftmost child first, i.e. as the fourth
element of the list representing the node.
.SH "AST OBJECTS"
In this representation an AST is represented by a Tcl object command
whose API is compatible to the tree objects provided by the package
\fBstruct::tree\fR. I.e it has to support at least all of the
methods described by that package, and may support more.
.PP
Because of this the remainder of the specifications is written using
the terms of \fBstruct::tree\fR.
.PP
Each node of the AST directly maps to a node in the tree object. All
data beyond the child nodes, i.e. node type and input locations, are
stored in attributes of the node in the tree object. They are:
.TP
type
The type of the AST node. The recognized values are \fBterminal\fR
and \fBnonterminal\fR.
.TP
range
The locations of the first and last token of the terminal data in the
input covered by the node. This is a list containing two locations.
.TP
detail
This attribute is present only for nonterminal nodes. It contains the
name of the nonterminal symbol stored in the node.
.PP
.SH "EXTENDED AST OBJECTS"
Extended AST objects are like AST objects, with additional
information.
.TP
detail
This attribute is now present at all nodes. Its contents are unchanged
for nonterminal nodes. For terminal nodes it contains a list
describing all tokens from the input which are covered by the node.
.sp
Each element of the list contains the token name, the associated
lexeme attribute, line number, and column index, in this order.
.TP
range_lc
This new attribute is defined for all nodes, and contains the
locations from attribute \fIrange\fR translated into line number and
column index. Lines are counted from 1, columns are counted from 0.
.PP
.SH "BUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK"
This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain
bugs and other problems.
Please report such in the category \fIgrammar_me\fR of the
\fITcllib SF Trackers\fR [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].
Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either
package and/or documentation.

'\" The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
'\" manual entries.
'\"
'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"
'\" .VE
'\"	End of vertical sidebar.
'\"
'\" .DS
'\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .DE
'\"	End of indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .SO
'\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
'\"	the option's class in the option database.
'\"
'\" .UL arg1 arg2
'\"	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

.TH "fifo2" n 2.2  "Memory channels"
.BS
.SH NAME
fifo2 \- Create and manipulate pipe fifo channels
.SH SYNOPSIS
package require \fBTcl \fR
.sp
package require \fBmemchan \fR
.sp
\fBfifo2\fR
.sp
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The command described here is only available in a not-yet released
version of the package. Use the CVS to get the sources.
.TP
\fBfifo2\fR
creates two stream-oriented in-memory channels and returns their
handles as a two-element list. There is no restriction on the ultimate
size of the channels, they will always grow as much as is necessary to
accomodate the data written into them.
.sp
In contrast to the channels generated by \fBfifo\fR a pair of channels
created here is connected internally in such a way that data written
into one channel can be read from the other. All data written into
them is read in the same order. This also means that the two channels
of the pair are not seekable.
.sp
The channels created here can be transfered between interpreters in
the same thread and between threads. As both channels in the pair can
be transfered independently they can be used to create a bidirectional
connection between two interpreters.
.PP
.PP
Memory channels created by \fBfifo2\fR provide two read-only options
which can be queried via the standard \fBfconfigure\fR command. These
are
.TP
-rlength
The value of this option is the number of bytes currently
available for reading from the channel.
.TP
-wlength
The value of this option is the number of bytes currently
written into the channel.
.PP
.PP
Note that the two lengths are switched for the channels of a pair. In
other words, the number of bytes written for one of the channels is
the number of bytes readable from the other end.
.PP
As the channels generated by \fBfifo2\fR grow as necessary they are
always writable. This means that a writable \fBfileevent\fR-handler
will fire continuously.
.PP
The channels are also readable if they contain more than zero
bytes. Under this conditions a readable \fBfileevent\fR-handler will
fire continuously.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Are you lost ?
Do you have trouble understanding this document ?
In that case please read the overview provided by the
\fIIntroduction to Parser Tools\fR. This document is the
entrypoint to the whole system the current package is a part of.
.PP
This package provides a manager for parsing expression grammars, with
each instance handling a set of plugins for the export of them to
other formats, i.e. their conversion to, for example \fInroff\fR,
\fIHTML\fR, etc.
.PP
It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools,
and is one of the three pillars the management of parsing expression
grammars resides on.
.PP
IMAGE: arch_core_export
.PP
The other two pillars are, as shown above
.IP [1]
\fIPEG Import\fR, and
.IP [2]
\fIPEG Storage\fR
.PP
.PP
For information about the data structure which is the major input to
the manager objects provided by this package see the section
\fBPEG serialization format\fR.
.PP
The plugin system of this class is based on the package
\fBpluginmgr\fR, and configured to look for plugins using
.IP [1]
the environment variable \fBGRAMMAR_PEG_EXPORT_PLUGINS\fR,
.IP [2]
the environment variable \fBGRAMMAR_PEG_PLUGINS\fR,
.IP [3]
the environment variable \fBGRAMMAR_PLUGINS\fR,
.IP [4]
the path "\fI~/.grammar/peg/export/plugin\fR"
.IP [5]
the path "\fI~/.grammar/peg/plugin\fR"
.IP [6]
the path "\fI~/.grammar/plugin\fR"
.IP [7]
the path "\fI~/.grammar/peg/export/plugins\fR"
.IP [8]
the path "\fI~/.grammar/peg/plugins\fR"
.IP [9]
the path "\fI~/.grammar/plugins\fR"
.IP [10]
the registry entry "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\GRAMMAR\\PEG\\EXPORT\\PLUGINS"
.IP [11]
the registry entry "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\GRAMMAR\\PEG\\PLUGINS"
.IP [12]
the registry entry "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\GRAMMAR\\PLUGINS"
.PP
The last three are used only when the package is run on a machine
using the Windows(tm) operating system.
.PP
The whole system is delivered with three predefined export plugins,
namely
.TP
container
See \fIPEG Export Plugin. To CONTAINER format\fR for details.
.TP
json
See \fIPEG Export Plugin. To JSON format\fR for details.
.TP
peg
See \fIPEG Export Plugin. To PEG format\fR for details.
.PP
.PP
For readers wishing to write their own export plugin for some format,
i.e. \fIplugin writer\fRs, reading and understanding the
\fIParser Tools Export API\fR specification is an absolute
necessity, as it documents the interaction between this package and
its plugins in detail.
.SH API
.SS "PACKAGE COMMANDS"
.TP
\fB::pt::peg::export\fR \fIobjectName\fR
This command creates a new export manager object with an associated
Tcl command whose name is \fIobjectName\fR. This \fIobject\fR command
is explained in full detail in the sections \fBObject command\fR
and \fBObject methods\fR. The object command will be created
under the current namespace if the \fIobjectName\fR is not fully
qualified, and in the specified namespace otherwise.
.PP
.SS "OBJECT COMMAND"
All objects created by the \fB::pt::peg::export\fR command have
the following general form:
.TP
\fBobjectName\fR \fBmethod\fR ?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
The method \fBmethod\fR and its \fIarg\fR'uments determine the
exact behavior of the command.
See section \fBObject methods\fR for the detailed
specifications.
.PP
.SS "OBJECT METHODS"
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBdestroy\fR
This method destroys the object it is invoked for.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBexport serial\fR \fIserial\fR ?\fIformat\fR?
This method takes the canonical serialization of a parsing expression
grammar stored in \fIserial\fR and converts it to the specified
\fIformat\fR, using the export plugin for the format. This will fail
with an error if no plugin could be found for the format.
The string generated by the conversion process is returned as
the result of this method.
.sp
If no format is specified the method defaults to \fBtext\fR.
.sp
The specification of what a \fIcanonical\fR serialization is can be
found in the section \fBPEG serialization format\fR.
.sp
The plugin has to conform to the interface documented in the
\fIParser Tools Export API\fR specification.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBexport object\fR \fIobject\fR ?\fIformat\fR?
This method is a convenient wrapper around the \fBexport serial\fR
method described by the previous item.
It expects that \fIobject\fR is an object command supporting a
\fBserialize\fR method returning the canonical serialization of a
parsing expression grammar. It invokes that method, feeds the result
into \fBexport serial\fR and returns the resulting string as its
own result.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBconfiguration names\fR
This method returns a list containing the names of all configuration
options currently known to the object.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBconfiguration get\fR
This method returns a dictionary containing the names and values of
all configuration options currently known to the object.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBconfiguration set\fR \fIname\fR ?\fIvalue\fR?
This method sets the configuration option \fIname\fR to the
specified \fIvalue\fR and returns the new value of the option.
.sp
If no value is specified it simply returns the current value, without
changing it.
.sp
Note that these configuration options and their values are simply
passed to a plugin when the actual export is performed. It is the
plugin which checks the validity, not the manager.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBconfiguration unset\fR \fIpattern\fR...
This method unsets all configuration options matching the specified
glob \fIpattern\fRs. If no pattern is specified it will unset all
currently defined configuration options.
.PP
.SH "PEG SERIALIZATION FORMAT"
Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize
Parsing Expression Grammars as immutable values for transport,
comparison, etc.
.PP
We distinguish between \fIregular\fR and \fIcanonical\fR
serializations.
While a PEG may have more than one regular serialization only exactly
one of them will be \fIcanonical\fR.
.TP
regular serialization
.RS
.IP [1]
The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.
.IP [2]
This dictionary holds a single key, \fBpt::grammar::peg\fR, and its
value. This value holds the contents of the grammar.
.IP [3]
The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding the set of
nonterminal symbols and the starting expression. The relevant keys and
their values are
.RS
.TP
\fBrules\fR
The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the names of the
nonterminal symbols known to the grammar.
.RS
.IP [1]
Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.
.IP [2]
The empty string is not a legal nonterminal symbol.
.IP [3]
The value for each symbol is a Tcl dictionary itself. The relevant
keys and their values in this dictionary are
.RS
.TP
\fBis\fR
The value is the serialization of the parsing expression describing
the symbols sentennial structure, as specified in the section
\fBPE serialization format\fR.
.TP
\fBmode\fR
The value can be one of three values specifying how a parser should
handle the semantic value produced by the symbol.
.RS
.TP
\fBvalue\fR
The semantic value of the nonterminal symbol is an abstract syntax
tree consisting of a single node node for the nonterminal itself,
which has the ASTs of the symbol's right hand side as its children.
.TP
\fBleaf\fR
The semantic value of the nonterminal symbol is an abstract syntax
tree consisting of a single node node for the nonterminal, without any
children. Any ASTs generated by the symbol's right hand side are
discarded.
.TP
\fBvoid\fR
The nonterminal has no semantic value. Any ASTs generated by the
symbol's right hand side are discarded (as well).
.RE
.RE
.RE
.TP
\fBstart\fR
The value is the serialization of the start parsing expression of the
grammar, as specified in the section \fBPE serialization format\fR.
.RE
.IP [4]
The terminal symbols of the grammar are specified implicitly as the
set of all terminal symbols used in the start expression and on the
RHS of the grammar rules.
.RE
.TP
canonical serialization
The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as specified
in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies the constraints
below, which make it unique among all the possible serializations of
this grammar.
.RS
.IP [1]
The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in
ascending dictionary order, as generated by Tcl's builtin command
\fBlsort -increasing -dict\fR.
.IP [2]
The string representation of the value is the canonical representation
of a Tcl dictionary. I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions are designed to copy small amounts of data to user-space.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines provide the following functionality:
.Bl -tag -width "suibyte()"
.\" ========
.It Fn subyte
Stores a byte of data to the user-space address
.Pa addr .
.\" ========
.It Fn suibyte
Stores a byte of data to the user-space address
.Pa addr .
This function is safe to call during an interrupt context.
.\" ========
.It Fn suiword
Stores a word of data to the user-space address
.Pa addr .
This function is safe to call during an interrupt context.
.\" ========
.It Fn sulong
Stores a long word of data to the user-space address
.Pa addr .
.\" ========
.It Fn suulong
Stores a unsigned long word of data to the user-space address
.Pa addr .
.\" ========
.It Fn suword
Stores a word of data to the user-space address
.Pa addr .

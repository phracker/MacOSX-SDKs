.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The glob angle-bracket operator \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR is a pathname generator that
implements the rules for file name pattern matching used by Unix-like shells
such as the Bourne shell or C shell.
.PP
\&\fIFile::Glob::bsd_glob()\fR implements the FreeBSD \fIglob\fR\|(3) routine, which is
a superset of the \s-1POSIX\s0 \fIglob()\fR (described in \s-1IEEE\s0 Std 1003.2 \*(L"\s-1POSIX.2\*(R"\s0).
\&\fIbsd_glob()\fR takes a mandatory \f(CW\*(C`pattern\*(C'\fR argument, and an optional
\&\f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR argument, and returns a list of filenames matching the
pattern, with interpretation of the pattern modified by the \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR
variable.
.PP
Since v5.6.0, Perl's \fICORE::glob()\fR is implemented in terms of \fIbsd_glob()\fR.
Note that they don't share the same prototype\*(--\fICORE::glob()\fR only accepts
a single argument.  Due to historical reasons, \fICORE::glob()\fR will also
split its argument on whitespace, treating it as multiple patterns,
whereas \fIbsd_glob()\fR considers them as one pattern.  But see \f(CW\*(C`:bsd_glob\*(C'\fR
under \*(L"\s-1EXPORTS\*(R"\s0, below.
.SS "\s-1META CHARACTERS\s0"
.IX Subsection "META CHARACTERS"
.Vb 6
\&  \e       Quote the next metacharacter
\&  []      Character class
\&  {}      Multiple pattern
\&  *       Match any string of characters
\&  ?       Match any single character
\&  ~       User name home directory
.Ve
.PP
The metanotation \f(CW\*(C`a{b,c,d}e\*(C'\fR is a shorthand for \f(CW\*(C`abe ace ade\*(C'\fR.  Left to
right order is preserved, with results of matches being sorted separately
at a low level to preserve this order.  As a special case \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR are passed undisturbed.
.SS "\s-1EXPORTS\s0"
.IX Subsection "EXPORTS"
See also the \*(L"\s-1POSIX FLAGS\*(R"\s0 below, which can be exported individually.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`:bsd_glob\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection ":bsd_glob"
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`:bsd_glob\*(C'\fR export tag exports \fIbsd_glob()\fR and the constants listed
below.  It also overrides \fIglob()\fR in the calling package with one that
behaves like \fIbsd_glob()\fR with regard to spaces (the space is treated as part
of a file name), but supports iteration in scalar context; i.e., it
preserves the core function's feature of returning the next item each time
it is called.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`:glob\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection ":glob"
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`:glob\*(C'\fR tag, now discouraged, is the old version of \f(CW\*(C`:bsd_glob\*(C'\fR.  It
exports the same constants and functions, but its \fIglob()\fR override does not
support iteration; it returns the last file name in scalar context.  That
means this will loop forever:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    use File::Glob \*(Aq:glob\*(Aq;
\&    while (my $file = <* copy.txt>) {
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`bsd_glob\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "bsd_glob"
.PP
This function, which is included in the two export tags listed above,
takes one or two arguments.  The first is the glob pattern.  The second is
a set of flags ORed together.  The available flags are listed below under
\&\*(L"\s-1POSIX FLAGS\*(R"\s0.  If the second argument is omitted, \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_CSH\*(C'\fR (or
\&\f(CW\*(C`GLOB_CSH|GLOB_NOCASE\*(C'\fR on \s-1VMS\s0 and DOSish systems) is used by default.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`:nocase\*(C'\fI and \f(CI\*(C`:case\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection ":nocase and :case"
.PP
These two export tags globally modify the default flags that \fIbsd_glob()\fR
and, except on \s-1VMS,\s0 Perl's built-in \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR operator use.  \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_NOCASE\*(C'\fR
is turned on or off, respectively.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`csh_glob\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "csh_glob"
.PP
The \fIcsh_glob()\fR function can also be exported, but you should not use it
directly unless you really know what you are doing.  It splits the pattern
into words and feeds each one to \fIbsd_glob()\fR.  Perl's own \fIglob()\fR function
uses this internally.
.SS "\s-1POSIX FLAGS\s0"
.IX Subsection "POSIX FLAGS"
The \s-1POSIX\s0 defined flags for \fIbsd_glob()\fR are:
.ie n .IP """GLOB_ERR""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_ERR\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_ERR"
Force \fIbsd_glob()\fR to return an error when it encounters a directory it
cannot open or read.  Ordinarily \fIbsd_glob()\fR continues to find matches.
.ie n .IP """GLOB_LIMIT""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_LIMIT\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_LIMIT"
Make \fIbsd_glob()\fR return an error (\s-1GLOB_NOSPACE\s0) when the pattern expands
to a size bigger than the system constant \f(CW\*(C`ARG_MAX\*(C'\fR (usually found in
limits.h).  If your system does not define this constant, \fIbsd_glob()\fR uses
\&\f(CW\*(C`sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`_POSIX_ARG_MAX\*(C'\fR where available (in that
order).  You can inspect these values using the standard \f(CW\*(C`POSIX\*(C'\fR
extension.
.ie n .IP """GLOB_MARK""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_MARK\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_MARK"
Each pathname that is a directory that matches the pattern has a slash
appended.
.ie n .IP """GLOB_NOCASE""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_NOCASE\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_NOCASE"
By default, file names are assumed to be case sensitive; this flag
makes \fIbsd_glob()\fR treat case differences as not significant.
.ie n .IP """GLOB_NOCHECK""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_NOCHECK\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_NOCHECK"
If the pattern does not match any pathname, then \fIbsd_glob()\fR returns a list
consisting of only the pattern.  If \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_QUOTE\*(C'\fR is set, its effect
is present in the pattern returned.
.ie n .IP """GLOB_NOSORT""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_NOSORT\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_NOSORT"
By default, the pathnames are sorted in ascending \s-1ASCII\s0 order; this
flag prevents that sorting (speeding up \fIbsd_glob()\fR).
.PP
The FreeBSD extensions to the \s-1POSIX\s0 standard are the following flags:
.ie n .IP """GLOB_BRACE""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_BRACE\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_BRACE"
Pre-process the string to expand \f(CW\*(C`{pat,pat,...}\*(C'\fR strings like \fIcsh\fR\|(1).
The pattern '{}' is left unexpanded for historical reasons (and \fIcsh\fR\|(1)
does the same thing to ease typing of \fIfind\fR\|(1) patterns).
.ie n .IP """GLOB_NOMAGIC""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_NOMAGIC\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_NOMAGIC"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_NOCHECK\*(C'\fR but it only returns the pattern if it does not
contain any of the special characters \*(L"*\*(R", \*(L"?\*(R" or \*(L"[\*(R".  \f(CW\*(C`NOMAGIC\*(C'\fR is
provided to simplify implementing the historic \fIcsh\fR\|(1) globbing
behaviour and should probably not be used anywhere else.
.ie n .IP """GLOB_QUOTE""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_QUOTE\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_QUOTE"
Use the backslash ('\e') character for quoting: every occurrence of a
backslash followed by a character in the pattern is replaced by that
character, avoiding any special interpretation of the character.
(But see below for exceptions on \s-1DOSISH\s0 systems).
.ie n .IP """GLOB_TILDE""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_TILDE\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_TILDE"
Expand patterns that start with '~' to user name home directories.
.ie n .IP """GLOB_CSH""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_CSH\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_CSH"
For convenience, \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_CSH\*(C'\fR is a synonym for
\&\f(CW\*(C`GLOB_BRACE | GLOB_NOMAGIC | GLOB_QUOTE | GLOB_TILDE | GLOB_ALPHASORT\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \s-1POSIX\s0 provided \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_APPEND\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_DOOFFS\*(C'\fR, and the FreeBSD
extensions \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_MAGCHAR\*(C'\fR flags have not been
implemented in the Perl version because they involve more complex
interaction with the underlying C structures.
.PP
The following flag has been added in the Perl implementation for
csh compatibility:
.ie n .IP """GLOB_ALPHASORT""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_ALPHASORT\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_ALPHASORT"
If \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_NOSORT\*(C'\fR is not in effect, sort filenames is alphabetical
order (case does not matter) rather than in \s-1ASCII\s0 order.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
\&\fIbsd_glob()\fR returns a list of matching paths, possibly zero length.  If an
error occurred, &File::Glob::GLOB_ERROR will be non-zero and \f(CW$!\fR will be
set.  &File::Glob::GLOB_ERROR is guaranteed to be zero if no error occurred,
or one of the following values otherwise:
.ie n .IP """GLOB_NOSPACE""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_NOSPACE\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_NOSPACE"
An attempt to allocate memory failed.
.ie n .IP """GLOB_ABEND""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWGLOB_ABEND\fR" 4
.IX Item "GLOB_ABEND"
The glob was stopped because an error was encountered.
.PP
In the case where \fIbsd_glob()\fR has found some matching paths, but is
interrupted by an error, it will return a list of filenames \fBand\fR
set &File::Glob::ERROR.
.PP
Note that \fIbsd_glob()\fR deviates from \s-1POSIX\s0 and FreeBSD \fIglob\fR\|(3) behaviour
by not considering \f(CW\*(C`ENOENT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ENOTDIR\*(C'\fR as errors \- \fIbsd_glob()\fR will
continue processing despite those errors, unless the \f(CW\*(C`GLOB_ERR\*(C'\fR flag is
set.
.PP
Be aware that all filenames returned from File::Glob are tainted.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you want to use multiple patterns, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`bsd_glob("a* b*")\*(C'\fR, you should
probably throw them in a set as in \f(CW\*(C`bsd_glob("{a*,b*}")\*(C'\fR.  This is because
the argument to \fIbsd_glob()\fR isn't subjected to parsing by the C shell.
Remember that you can use a backslash to escape things.
.IP "\(bu" 4
On \s-1DOSISH\s0 systems, backslash is a valid directory separator character.
In this case, use of backslash as a quoting character (via \s-1GLOB_QUOTE\s0)
interferes with the use of backslash as a directory separator.  The
best (simplest, most portable) solution is to use forward slashes for
directory separators, and backslashes for quoting.  However, this does
not match \*(L"normal practice\*(R" on these systems.  As a concession to user
expectation, therefore, backslashes (under \s-1GLOB_QUOTE\s0) only quote the
glob metacharacters '[', ']', '{', '}', '\-', '~', and backslash itself.
All other backslashes are passed through unchanged.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Win32 users should use the real slash.  If you really want to use
backslashes, consider using Sarathy's File::DosGlob, which comes with
the standard Perl distribution.

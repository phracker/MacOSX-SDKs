.Sh NAME
.Nm fabs
.Nd floating-point absolute value function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn fabs "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn fabsl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn fabsf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fabs
functions compute the absolute value of a floating-point number
.Fa x .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn fabs "±0"
returns 0.
.Pp
.Fn fabs "±infinity"
returns +infinity.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn fabs
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vfabsf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvfabsf " float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvfabs "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr ceil 3 ,
.Xr floor 3 ,
.Xr rint 3 ,
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fabs
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

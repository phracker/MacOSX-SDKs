.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn devname
function returns a pointer to the name of the block or character
device in
.Dq Pa /dev
with a device number of
.Fa dev ,
and a file type matching the one encoded in
.Fa type
which must be one of
.Dv S_IFBLK
or
.Dv S_IFCHR .
If no device matches the specified values, or no information is
available, NULL is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn devname
function uses a static buffer, which will be overwritten
on subsequent calls.
The
.Fn devname_r
functions takes a buffer and length as arguments to avoid this problem.
.Pp
The traditional display for applications when no device is
found is the string
.Dq ?? .

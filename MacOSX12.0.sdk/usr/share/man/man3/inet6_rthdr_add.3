.Sh DESCRIPTION
RFC2292 IPv6 advanced API defines eight
functions that the application calls to build and examine a Routing
header.  Four functions build a Routing header:
.Bl -hang
.It Fn inet6_rthdr_space
return #bytes required for ancillary data
.It Fn inet6_rthdr_init
initialize ancillary data for Routing header
.It Fn inet6_rthdr_add
add IPv6 address & flags to Routing header
.It Fn inet6_rthdr_lasthop
specify the flags for the final hop
.El
.Pp
Four functions deal with a returned Routing header:
.Bl -hang
.It Fn inet6_rthdr_reverse
reverse a Routing header
.It Fn inet6_rthdr_segments
return #segments in a Routing header
.It Fn inet6_rthdr_getaddr
fetch one address from a Routing header
.It Fn inet6_rthdr_getflags
fetch one flag from a Routing header
.El
.Pp
The function prototypes for these functions are all in the
.Aq Li netinet/in.h
header.
.Pp
The full description of these functions is available in RFC2292.
.\"
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Fn inet6_rthdr_space
returns 0 on errors.
.Pp
.Fn inet6_rthdr_add ,
.Fn inet6_rthdr_lasthop
and
.Fn inet6_rthdr_reverse
return 0 on success, and returns -1 on error.
.Pp
.Fn inet6_rthdr_init
and
.Fn inet6_rthdr_getaddr
return
.Dv NULL
on error.
.Pp
.Fn inet6_rthdr_segments
and
.Fn inet6_rthdr_getflags
return -1 on error.

.Dt DIRNAME 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dirname
.Nd extract the directory part of a pathname
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libgen.h
.Ft char *
.Fo dirname
.Fa "char *path"
.Fc
.Ft char *
.Fo dirname_r
.Fa "const char *path" "char *dname"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn dirname
function is the converse of
.Xr basename 3 ;
it returns a pointer to the parent directory of the pathname pointed to by
.Fa path .
Any trailing
.Sq \&/
characters are not counted as part of the directory
name.
If
.Fa path
is a null pointer, the empty string, or contains no
.Sq \&/
characters,
.Fn dirname
returns a pointer to the string
.Qq \&. ,
signifying the current directory.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.Fn dirname
function
returns a pointer to internal storage space allocated on the first call
that will be overwritten
by subsequent calls.
.Fn dirname_r
is therefore preferred for threaded applications.
.Pp
Other vendor implementations of
.Fn dirname
may modify the contents of the string passed to
.Fn dirname ;
if portability is desired,
this should be taken into account when writing code which calls this function.
.Sh LEGACY SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <libgen.h>
.Pp
.Ft char *
.br
.Fo dirname
.Fa "const char *path"
.Fc ;
.Pp
In legacy mode,
.Fa path
will not be changed.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful completion,
.Fn dirname
returns a pointer to the parent directory of
.Fa path .
.Pp
If
.Fn dirname
fails, a null pointer is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The following error codes may be set in
.Va errno :
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
The path component to be returned was larger than
.Dv MAXPATHLEN .
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The static buffer used for storing the path in
.Fn dirname
could not be allocated.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn swab
copies
.Fa nbytes
bytes from the location referenced by
.Fa src
to the location referenced by
.Fa dest ,
swapping adjacent bytes.
.Pp
The argument
.Fa nbytes
should be an even number.  If
.Fa nbytes
is odd,
.Fn swab
copies and exchanges
.Fa nbytes
-1 bytes and the disposition of the last byte is unspecified.
If copying takes place between objects that overlap,
the behavior is undefined. If
.Fa nbytes
is negative,
.Fn swab
does nothing.

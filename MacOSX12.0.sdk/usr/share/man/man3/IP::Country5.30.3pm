.SH "NAME"
IP::Country \- fast lookup of country codes from IP addresses
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.Vb 5
\&  use IP::Country::Fast;

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Finding the home country of a client using only the \s-1IP\s0 address can be difficult.
Looking up the domain name associated with that address can provide some help,
but many \s-1IP\s0 address are not reverse mapped to any useful domain, and the
most common domain (.com) offers no help when looking for country.
.PP
This module comes bundled with a database of countries where various \s-1IP\s0 addresses
have been assigned. Although the country of assignment will probably be the
country associated with a large \s-1ISP\s0 rather than the client herself, this is
probably good enough for most log analysis applications, and under test has proved
to be as accurate as reverse-DNS and \s-1WHOIS\s0 lookup.
.SH "CONSTRUCTOR"

The constructor takes no arguments.

.SH "OBJECT METHODS"

All object methods are designed to be used in an object-oriented fashion.
.PP
.Vb 1

.PP
Using the module in a procedural fashion (without the arrow syntax) won't work.
.ie n .IP "$cc = $reg\->inet_atocc(\s-1HOSTNAME\s0)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$cc\fR = \f(CW$reg\fR\->inet_atocc(\s-1HOSTNAME\s0)" 4
.IX Item "$cc = $reg->inet_atocc(HOSTNAME)"
Takes a string giving the name of a host, and translates that to an
two-letter country code. Takes arguments of both the 'rtfm.mit.edu' 
type and '18.181.0.24'. If the host name cannot be resolved, returns undef. 
If the resolved \s-1IP\s0 address is not contained within the database, returns undef.
For multi-homed hosts (hosts with more than one address), the first 
address found is returned. For private Internet addresses (see \s-1RFC1918\s0), 
returns two asterisks '**'.
.ie n .IP "$cc = $reg\->inet_ntocc(\s-1IP_ADDRESS\s0)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$cc\fR = \f(CW$reg\fR\->inet_ntocc(\s-1IP_ADDRESS\s0)" 4
.IX Item "$cc = $reg->inet_ntocc(IP_ADDRESS)"
Takes a string (an opaque string as returned by \fBSocket::inet_aton()\fR) 
and translates it into a two-letter country code. If the \s-1IP\s0 address is 
not contained within the database, returns undef.
.ie n .IP "$cc = $reg\->\fBdb_time()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$cc\fR = \f(CW$reg\fR\->\fBdb_time()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$cc = $reg->db_time()"
Returns the creation date of the database, measured as number of seconds 
since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 \s-1GMT,\s0 January 1, 1970). Suitable for feeding 
to \*(L"gmtime\*(R" and \*(L"localtime\*(R". When used with IP::Country::Medium or Slow objects,
returns zero.
.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.IX Header "PERFORMANCE"
With a random selection of 65,000 \s-1IP\s0 addresses, the module can look up
over 15,000 \s-1IP\s0 addresses per second on a 730MHz \s-1PIII\s0 (Coppermine) and
over 25,000 \s-1IP\s0 addresses per second on a 1.3GHz Athlon. Out of this random 
selection of \s-1IP\s0 addresses, 43% had an associated country code. Please let 
me know if you've run this against a set of 'real' \s-1IP\s0 addresses from your
log files, and have details of the proportion of IPs that had associated
country codes.
.SH "IP::Country::Slow warning"
.IX Header "IP::Country::Slow warning"
During tests of this module, it was found that there was no measurable advantage in using
this module in preference to IP::Country::Medium or IP::Country::Fast. You should
use IP::Country::Medium is the majority of your lookups are of the form 'rtfm.mit.edu'
(domain names), and IP::Country::Fast if the majority of your lookups are of the form
\&'18.181.0.24' (\s-1IP\s0 addresses).
.PP
IP::Country::Medium caches domain-name lookups, whereas IP::Country::Fast does not.
.PP
It is *very* rare for a domain-name lookup to differ from the database used by
IP::Country::Fast. Thus, there is no good reason to prefer a slow domain-name 
lookup to a fast database lookup. Nor is there any significant difference in
coverage between the domain-name system and database. If you can find a real reason
to use IP::Country::Slow, let me know.
.SH "COUNTRY CODES"
.IX Header "COUNTRY CODES"
You'll probably want some kind of country code \-> country name conversion
utility: you should use Geography::Countries from \s-1CPAN.\s0
.PP
However, you should note the circumstances where the country code returned by
IP::Country will deviate from those used by Geography::Countries:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  AP \- non\-specific Asia\-Pacific location
\&  CS \- Czechoslovakia (former)
\&  EU \- non\-specific European Union location
\&  FX \- France, Metropolitan
\&  PS \- Palestinian Territory, Occupied
\&  ** \- intranet address
\&  undef \- not in database
.Ve
.SH "BUGS/LIMITATIONS"
.IX Header "BUGS/LIMITATIONS"
Only works with IPv4 addresses and \s-1ASCII\s0 hostnames.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IX Header "SEE ALSO"
IP::Country::Fast \- recommended for lookups of hostnames which are mostly
in the dotted-quad form ('213.45.67.89').
.PP
IP::Country::Medium \- recommended for lookups of hostnames which are mostly
in the domain-name form ('www.yahoo.com'). Caches domain-name lookups.
.PP
IP::Country::Slow \- \s-1NOT RECOMMENDED.\s0 Only included for completeness. Prefers
domain-name lookups to database lookups, which is an expensive strategy of
no benefit.
.PP
Geo::IP \- wrapper around the geoip C libraries. Less portable. Not measurably 
faster than these native Perl modules. Paid subscription required for database
updates.

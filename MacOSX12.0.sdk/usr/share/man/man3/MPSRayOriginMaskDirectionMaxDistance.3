.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Represents a 3D ray with an origin, a direction, and a mask to filter out intersections\&. 

This type is available from the Metal Shading Language by including the MetalPerformanceShaders/MetalPerformanceShaders\&.h header\&.

.SS "\fBMPSPackedFloat3\fP MPSRayOriginMaskDirectionMaxDistance::direction"

.PP
Ray direction\&. Does not need to be normalized\&. The intersection test will be skipped if the direction has length zero or contains NaNs or infinities\&. 
.SS "unsigned int MPSRayOriginMaskDirectionMaxDistance::mask"

.PP
Ray mask which is bitwise AND-ed with instance and primitive masks to filter out intersections\&. The intersection test will be skipped if the mask is zero\&. 
.SS "float MPSRayOriginMaskDirectionMaxDistance::maxDistance"

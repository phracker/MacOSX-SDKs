.SS "Utility Functions"
.IX Subsection "Utility Functions"
Exporter::Tiny is itself an exporter!
.PP
These functions are really for internal use, but can be exported if you
need them:
.ie n .IP """mkopt(\e@array)""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWmkopt(\e@array)\fR" 4
.IX Item "mkopt(@array)"
Similar to \f(CW\*(C`mkopt\*(C'\fR from Data::OptList. It doesn't support all the
fancy options that Data::OptList does (\f(CW\*(C`moniker\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`require_unique\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`must_be\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`name_test\*(C'\fR) but runs about 50% faster.
.ie n .IP """mkopt_hash(\e@array)""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWmkopt_hash(\e@array)\fR" 4
.IX Item "mkopt_hash(@array)"
Similar to \f(CW\*(C`mkopt_hash\*(C'\fR from Data::OptList. See also \f(CW\*(C`mkopt\*(C'\fR.
.SS "History"
.IX Subsection "History"
Type::Library had a bunch of custom exporting code which poked coderefs
into its caller's stash. It needed this to be something more powerful than
most exporters so that it could switch between exporting Moose, Mouse and
Moo-compatible objects on request. Sub::Exporter would have been capable,
but had too many dependencies for the Type::Tiny project.
.PP
Meanwhile Type::Utils, Types::TypeTiny and Test::TypeTiny each
used the venerable Exporter.pm. However, this meant they were
unable to use the features like Sub::Exporter\-style function renaming
which I'd built into Type::Library:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   ## import "Str" but rename it to "String".
\&   use Types::Standard "Str" => { \-as => "String" };
.Ve
.PP
And so I decided to factor out code that could be shared by all Type-Tiny's
exporters into a single place: Exporter::TypeTiny.
.PP
As of version 0.026, Exporter::TypeTiny was also made available as
Exporter::Tiny, distributed independently on \s-1CPAN. CHOCOLATEBOY\s0 had
convinced me that it was mature enough to live a life of its own.
.PP
As of version 0.030, Type-Tiny depends on Exporter::Tiny and
Exporter::TypeTiny is being phased out.

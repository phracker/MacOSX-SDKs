.Sh NAME
.Nm ceil
.Nd round to smallest integral value not less than x
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn ceil "double x"
.br
.Ft long double
.Fn ceill "long double x"
.br
.Ft float
.Fn ceilf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ceil
functions return the smallest integral value 
greater than or equal to
.Fa x .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn ceil "±0"
returns ±0.
.Pp
.Fn ceil "±infinity"
returns ±infinity.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn ceil
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vceilf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvceilf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvceil "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;

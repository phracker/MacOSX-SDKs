.IP "new [\s-1SOURCE\s0]" 4
.IX Item "new [SOURCE]"
\&\fIClass method.\fR
Create a new, empty \s-1MIME\s0 entity.
Basically, this uses the Mail::Internet constructor...
.Sp
If \s-1SOURCE\s0 is an \s-1ARRAYREF,\s0 it is assumed to be an array of lines
that will be used to create both the header and an in-core body.
.Sp
Else, if \s-1SOURCE\s0 is defined, it is assumed to be a filehandle
from which the header and in-core body is to be read.
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR in either case, the body will not be \fIparsed:\fR merely read!
.IP "add_part \s-1ENTITY,\s0 [\s-1OFFSET\s0]" 4
.IX Item "add_part ENTITY, [OFFSET]"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
Assuming we are a multipart message, add a body part (a MIME::Entity)
to the array of body parts.  Returns the part that was just added.
.Sp
If \s-1OFFSET\s0 is positive, the new part is added at that offset from the
beginning of the array of parts.  If it is negative, it counts from
the end of the array.  (An \s-1INDEX\s0 of \-1 will place the new part at the
very end of the array, \-2 will place it as the penultimate item in the
array, etc.)  If \s-1OFFSET\s0 is not given, the new part is added to the end
of the array.
\&\fIThanks to Jason L Tibbitts \s-1III\s0 for providing support for \s-1OFFSET.\s0\fR
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR in general, you only want to attach parts to entities
with a content-type of \f(CW\*(C`multipart/*\*(C'\fR).
.IP "attach \s-1PARAMHASH\s0" 4
.IX Item "attach PARAMHASH"
\&\fIInstance method.\fR
The real quick-and-easy way to create multipart messages.
The \s-1PARAMHASH\s0 is used to \f(CW\*(C`build\*(C'\fR a new entity; this method is
basically equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $entity\->add_part(ref($entity)\->build(PARAMHASH, Top=>0));
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR normally, you attach to multipart entities; however, if you
attach something to a singlepart (like attaching a \s-1GIF\s0 to a text
message), the singlepart will be coerced into a multipart automatically.
.IP "build \s-1PARAMHASH\s0" 4
.IX Item "build PARAMHASH"
\&\fIClass/instance method.\fR
A quick-and-easy catch-all way to create an entity.  Use it like this
to build a \*(L"normal\*(R" single-part entity:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&   $ent = MIME::Entity\->build(Type     => "image/gif",
\&                              Encoding => "base64",
\&                              Path     => "/path/to/xyz12345.gif",
\&                              Filename => "saveme.gif",
\&                              Disposition => "attachment");
.Ve
.Sp
And like this to build a \*(L"multipart\*(R" entity:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   $ent = MIME::Entity\->build(Type     => "multipart/mixed",
\&                              Boundary => "\-\-\-1234567");
.Ve
.Sp
A minimal \s-1MIME\s0 header will be created.  If you want to add or modify
any header fields afterwards, you can of course do so via the underlying
head object... but hey, there's now a prettier syntax!
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&   $ent = MIME::Entity\->build(Type          =>"multipart/mixed",
\&                              From          => $myaddr,
\&                              Subject       => "Hi!",
\&                              \*(AqX\-Certified\*(Aq => [\*(AqSINED\*(Aq,
\&                                                \*(AqSEELED\*(Aq,
\&                                                \*(AqDELIVERED\*(Aq]);
.Ve
.Sp
Normally, an \f(CW\*(C`X\-Mailer\*(C'\fR header field is output which contains this
toolkit's name and version (plus this module's \s-1RCS\s0 version).
This will allow any bad \s-1MIME\s0 we generate to be traced back to us.
You can of course overwrite that header with your own:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   $ent = MIME::Entity\->build(Type        => "multipart/mixed",
\&                              \*(AqX\-Mailer\*(Aq  => "myprog 1.1");
.Ve
.Sp
Or remove it entirely:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   $ent = MIME::Entity\->build(Type       => "multipart/mixed",
\&                              \*(AqX\-Mailer\*(Aq => undef);
.Ve
.Sp
\&\s-1OK,\s0 enough hype.  The parameters are:
.RS 4
.IP "(\s-1FIELDNAME\s0)" 4
.IX Item "(FIELDNAME)"
Any field you want placed in the message header, taken from the
standard list of header fields (you don't need to worry about case):
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    Bcc           Encrypted     Received      Sender
\&    Cc            From          References    Subject

\&    Date          MIME\-Version  Return\-Path
\&                  Organization
.Ve
.Sp
To give experienced users some veto power, these fields will be set
\&\fIafter\fR the ones I set... so be careful: \fIdon't set any \s-1MIME\s0 fields\fR
(like \f(CW\*(C`Content\-type\*(C'\fR) unless you know what you're doing!
.Sp
To specify a fieldname that's \fInot\fR in the above list, even one that's
identical to an option below, just give it with a trailing \f(CW":"\fR,
like \f(CW"My\-field:"\fR.  When in doubt, that \fIalways\fR signals a mail
field (and it sort of looks like one too).
.IP "Boundary" 4
.IX Item "Boundary"
\&\fIMultipart entities only. Optional.\fR
The boundary string.  As per \s-1RFC\-2046,\s0 it must consist only
of the characters \f(CW\*(C`[0\-9a\-zA\-Z\*(Aq()+_,\-./:=?]\*(C'\fR and space (you'll be
warned, and your boundary will be ignored, if this is not the case).
If you omit this, a random string will be chosen... which is probably
safer.
.IP "Charset" 4
.IX Item "Charset"
\&\fIOptional.\fR
The character set.
.IP "Data" 4
.IX Item "Data"
\&\fISingle-part entities only. Optional.\fR
An alternative to Path (q.v.): the actual data, either as a scalar
or an array reference (whose elements are joined together to make
the actual scalar).  The body is opened on the data using

Why? because if we can't decode the message, then we have to take

The body is output for inclusion in a valid \s-1MIME\s0 stream; this means

A printed multipart body includes the printed representations of its subparts.

the transfer encoding is used to determine how it should be \fIoutput.\fR
This means that the \f(CW\*(C`print()\*(C'\fR method is always guaranteed to get you
a sendmail-ready stream whose body is consistent with its head.
If you want the \fIraw body data\fR to be output, you can either read it from
the bodyhandle yourself, or use:
.Sp
.Vb 1

which uses \fIread()\fR calls to extract the information, and thus will
work with both text and binary bodies.

MIME::Entity and Mail::Internet see message bodies differently,
and this can cause confusion and some inconvenience.  Sadly, I can't
change the behavior of MIME::Entity without breaking lots of code already
out there.  But let's open up the floor for a few questions...
.ie n .IP "What is the difference between a ""message"" and an ""entity""?" 4
.el .IP "What is the difference between a ``message'' and an ``entity''?" 4
.IX Item "What is the difference between a message and an entity?"
A \fBmessage\fR is the actual data being sent or received; usually
this means a stream of newline-terminated lines.
An \fBentity\fR is the representation of a message as an object.
.Sp
This means that you get a \*(L"message\*(R" when you print an \*(L"entity\*(R"
\&\fIto\fR a filehandle, and you get an \*(L"entity\*(R" when you parse a message
\&\fIfrom\fR a filehandle.
.IP "What is a message body?" 4
.IX Item "What is a message body?"
\&\fBMail::Internet:\fR
The portion of the printed message after the header.
.Sp
\&\fBMIME::Entity:\fR
The portion of the printed message after the header.
.IP "How is a message body stored in an entity?" 4
.IX Item "How is a message body stored in an entity?"
\&\fBMail::Internet:\fR
As an array of lines.
.Sp
\&\fBMIME::Entity:\fR
It depends on the content-type of the message.
For \*(L"container\*(R" types (\f(CW\*(C`multipart/*\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`message/*\*(C'\fR), we store the
contained entities as an array of \*(L"parts\*(R", accessed via the \f(CW\*(C`parts()\*(C'\fR
method, where each part is a complete MIME::Entity.
For \*(L"singlepart\*(R" types (\f(CW\*(C`text/*\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`image/*\*(C'\fR, etc.), the unencoded
body data is referenced via a MIME::Body object, accessed via
the \f(CW\*(C`bodyhandle()\*(C'\fR method:
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&                      bodyhandle()   parts()
\&    Content\-type:     returns:       returns:
\&    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&    application/*     MIME::Body     empty
\&    audio/*           MIME::Body     empty
\&    image/*           MIME::Body     empty
\&    message/*         undef          MIME::Entity list (usually 1)
\&    multipart/*       undef          MIME::Entity list (usually >0)
\&    text/*            MIME::Body     empty
\&    video/*           MIME::Body     empty
\&    x\-*/*             MIME::Body     empty
.Ve
.Sp
As a special case, \f(CW\*(C`message/*\*(C'\fR is currently ambiguous: depending
on the parser, a \f(CW\*(C`message/*\*(C'\fR might be treated as a singlepart,
with a MIME::Body and no parts.  Use \fIbodyhandle()\fR as the final
arbiter.
.IP "What does the \fIbody()\fR method return?" 4

\&\fBMail::Internet:\fR
Use the \fIbody()\fR method.
.Sp
\&\fBMIME::Entity:\fR
Use the \fI\fIbodyhandle()\fI\fR method!
If \fIbodyhandle()\fR method returns true, then that value is a
MIME::Body which can be used to access the data via
its \fIopen()\fR method.  If \fIbodyhandle()\fR method returns an undefined value,
then the entity is probably a \*(L"container\*(R" that has no real body data of
its own (e.g., a \*(L"multipart\*(R" message): in this case, you should access
the components via the \fIparts()\fR method.  Like this:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    if ($bh = $entity\->bodyhandle) {
\&        $io = $bh\->open;
\&        ...access unencoded data via $io\->getline or $io\->read...

\&        $unencoded_data = $bh\->as_string;

.IP "Why is MIME::Entity so different from Mail::Internet?" 4
.IX Item "Why is MIME::Entity so different from Mail::Internet?"
Because \s-1MIME\s0 streams are expected to have non-textual data...
possibly, quite a lot of it, such as a tar file.
.Sp
Because \s-1MIME\s0 messages can consist of multiple parts, which are most-easily
manipulated as MIME::Entity objects themselves.
.Sp
Because in the simpler world of Mail::Internet, the data of a message
and its printed representation are \fIidentical\fR... and in the \s-1MIME\s0
world, they're not.
.Sp
Because parsing multipart bodies on-the-fly, or formatting multipart
bodies for output, is a non-trivial task.
.IP "This is confusing.  Can the two classes be made more compatible?" 4
.IX Item "This is confusing. Can the two classes be made more compatible?"
Not easily; their implementations are necessarily quite different.
Mail::Internet is a simple, efficient way of dealing with a \*(L"black box\*(R"
mail message... one whose internal data you don't care much about.
MIME::Entity, in contrast, cares \fIvery much\fR about the message contents:
that's its job!
.SS "Design issues"

.IP "Some things just can't be ignored" 4
.IX Item "Some things just can't be ignored"
In multipart messages, the \fI\*(L"preamble\*(R"\fR is the portion that precedes
the first encapsulation boundary, and the \fI\*(L"epilogue\*(R"\fR is the portion
that follows the last encapsulation boundary.
.Sp
According to \s-1RFC 2046:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    There appears to be room for additional information prior
\&    to the first encapsulation boundary and following the final
\&    boundary.  These areas should generally be left blank, and
\&    implementations must ignore anything that appears before the
\&    first boundary or after the last one.
\&
\&    NOTE: These "preamble" and "epilogue" areas are generally
\&    not used because of the lack of proper typing of these parts
\&    and the lack of clear semantics for handling these areas at
\&    gateways, particularly X.400 gateways.  However, rather than
\&    leaving the preamble area blank, many MIME implementations
\&    have found this to be a convenient place to insert an
\&    explanatory note for recipients who read the message with
\&    pre\-MIME software, since such notes will be ignored by
\&    MIME\-compliant software.
.Ve
.Sp
In the world of standards-and-practices, that's the standard.
Now for the practice:
.Sp
\&\fISome \*(L"\s-1MIME\*(R"\s0 mailers may incorrectly put a \*(L"part\*(R" in the preamble\fR.
Since we have to parse over the stuff \fIanyway\fR, in the future I
\&\fImay\fR allow the parser option of creating special MIME::Entity objects
for the preamble and epilogue, with bogus MIME::Head objects.
.Sp
For now, though, we're MIME-compliant, so I probably won't change
how we work.

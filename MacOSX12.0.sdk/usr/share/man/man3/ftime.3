.Sh NAME
.Nm ftime
.Nd get date and time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/timeb.h
.Ft int
.Fo ftime
.Fa "struct timeb *tp"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is obsoleted by
.Xr gettimeofday 2 .
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn ftime
routine fills in a structure pointed to by its argument,
as defined by
.Aq Pa sys/timeb.h :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/*
 * Structure returned by ftime system call
 */
struct timeb
{
	  time_t  time;
	  unsigned short millitm;
	  short   timezone;
	  short   dstflag;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The structure contains the time since the epoch, in seconds;
up to 1000 milliseconds of more-precise interval;
the local time zone (measured in minutes of time westward from Greenwich);
and a flag that, if nonzero, indicates that
Daylight Saving time applies locally during the appropriate part of the year.

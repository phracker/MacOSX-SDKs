function converts a single-byte character into a corresponding wide character.
If the character is
.Dv EOF
or not valid in the initial shift state,
.Fn btowc
returns
.Dv WEOF .
.Pp
The
.Fn wctob
function converts a wide character into a corresponding single-byte character.
If the wide character is
.Dv WEOF
or not able to be represented as a single byte in the initial shift state,
.Fn wctob
returns
.Dv WEOF .

.Fn btowc
and
.Fn wctob
functions use the current locale, the
.Fn btowc_l
and

functions may be passed locales directly. See

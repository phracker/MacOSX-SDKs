.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These functions implement support for a generic timer handling
mechanism for multiple parts of an application to register function
callbacks to happen at a particular time in the future.
.SH USAGE
.PP
The usage is fairly simple and straight-forward:  Simply create a
function you want called back at some point in the future.  The
function definition should be similar to:
.RS 4
.PP
.BI "void my_callback(unsigned int " reg ", void *" clientarg ");"
.RE
.PP
Then, call
.B snmp_alarm_register()
to register your callback to be called
.I seconds
from now.  The
.I flags
field should either be 
.I SA_REPEAT
or
.I NULL.
If flags is set with
.I SA_REPEAT,
then the registered callback function will be called every
.I seconds.
If
.I flags
is
.I NULL
then the function will only be called once and then removed from the
alarm system registration.
.PP
The
.I clientarg
parameter in the registration function is used only by
the client function and is stored and passed back directly to them on
every call to the system.
.PP
The 
.B snmp_alarm_register()
function returns a unique
.I "unsigned int"
(which is also passed as the first argument of each callback), which
can then be used to remove the callback from the queue at a later
point in the future using the
.B snmp_alarm_unregister()
function. If the
.B snmp_alarm_register()
call fails it returns zero.  In particular, note that it is entirely
permissible for an alarm function to unregister itself.
.PP
The
.B snmp_alarm_register_hr()
function is identical in operation to the
.B snmp_alarm_register()
function, but takes a
.I "struct timeval"
as a first parameter, and schedules the callback after the period
represented by
.I t
(the letters
.B hr
stand for "high resolution").  The operation of this function is
dependent on the provision of the
.BR setitimer (2)
system call by the operating system.  If this system call is not
available, the alarm will be scheduled as if
.B snmp_alarm_register()
had been called with a first argument equal to the value of the
.I tv_sec
member of
.IR "t".
See, however, the notes below.
.SH INITIALIZATION
The
.B init_snmp()
function initialises the snmp_alarm subsystem by calling 
.B init_snmp_alarm()
and then 
.B init_alarm_post_config()
to set up the first timer to initialise the callback function.  These
two functions should not be used directly by applications.
.SH "NOTES"
The default behaviour of the snmp_alarm subsystem is to request
.I SIGALRM
signals from the operating system via the
.BR alarm (2)
or
.BR setitimer (2)
system calls.  This has the disadvantage, however, that no other part
of the application can use the
.I SIGLARM
functionality (or, if some other part of the application
.I does
use the
.I SIGALRM
functionality, the snmp_alarm subsystem will not work correctly).
.PP
If your application runs a 
.BR select (2)-based
event loop, however, there is no need to use
.I SIGALRM
for the snmp_alarm subsystem, leaving it available for other parts of
the application.  This is done by making the following call:
.PP
.nf
netsnmp_ds_set_boolean(NETSNMP_DS_LIBRARY_ID, 
                       NETSNMP_DS_LIB_ALARM_DONT_USE_SIG, 1);
.fi
.PP
before calling
.BR "init_snmp()".
Then, 
.BR snmp_select_info()
takes alarms into account when calculating the timeout value to be
used for
.BR select (2).
All you need to do is call
.BR run_alarms()
when
.BR select (2)
times out (return value of zero).  This is the approach taken in the
agent; see
.IR "snmpd.c".
Furthermore, when using this method, high resolution alarms do not
depend on the presence of the
.BR setitimer (2)
system call, although overall precision is of course still determined
by the underlying operating system.  Recommended.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "Encoding Names"
.IX Subsection "Encoding Names"
Encoding names are case insensitive. White space in names
is ignored.  In addition, an encoding may have aliases.
Each encoding has one \*(L"canonical\*(R" name.  The \*(L"canonical\*(R"
name is chosen from the names of the encoding by picking
the first in the following sequence (with a few exceptions).
.IP "\(bu" 2
The name used by the Perl community.  That includes 'utf8' and 'ascii'.
Unlike aliases, canonical names directly reach the method so such
frequently used words like 'utf8' don't need to do alias lookups.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \s-1MIME\s0 name as defined in \s-1IETF\s0 RFCs.  This includes all \*(L"iso\-\*(R"s.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The name in the \s-1IANA\s0 registry.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The name used by the organization that defined it.
.PP
In case \fIde jure\fR canonical names differ from that of the Encode
module, they are always aliased if it ever be implemented.  So you can
safely tell if a given encoding is implemented or not just by passing 
the canonical name.
.PP
Because of all the alias issues, and because in the general case 
encodings have state, \*(L"Encode\*(R" uses an encoding object internally 
once an operation is in progress.
.SH "Supported Encodings"
.IX Header "Supported Encodings"
As of Perl 5.8.0, at least the following encodings are recognized.
Note that unless otherwise specified, they are all case insensitive
(via alias) and all occurrence of spaces are replaced with '\-'.
In other words, \*(L"\s-1ISO 8859 1\*(R"\s0 and \*(L"iso\-8859\-1\*(R" are identical.
.PP
Encodings are categorized and implemented in several different modules
but you don't have to \f(CW\*(C`use Encode::XX\*(C'\fR to make them available for
most cases.  Encode.pm will automatically load those modules on demand.

\&\s-1GSM0338\s0 is for \s-1GSM\s0 handsets. Though it shares alphanumerals with

sequences (starting with 0x1B) to cover e.g. the Euro sign.

This was once handled by Encode::Bytes but because of all those

.SH "Encoding vs. Charset \*(-- terminology"
.IX Header "Encoding vs. Charset terminology"
We are used to using the term (character) \fIencoding\fR and \fIcharacter
set\fR interchangeably.  But just as confusing the terms byte and
character is dangerous and the terms should be differentiated when
needed, we need to differentiate \fIencoding\fR and \fIcharacter set\fR.
.PP
To understand that, here is a description of how we make computers
grok our characters.
.IP "\(bu" 2
First we start with which characters to include.  We call this
collection of characters \fIcharacter repertoire\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Then we have to give each character a unique \s-1ID\s0 so your computer can
tell the difference between 'a' and 'A'.  This itemized character
repertoire is now a \fIcharacter set\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 2
If your computer can grow the character set without further
processing, you can go ahead and use it.  This is called a \fIcoded
character set\fR (\s-1CCS\s0) or \fIraw character encoding\fR.  \s-1ASCII\s0 is used this
way for most cases.
.IP "\(bu" 2
But in many cases, especially multi-byte \s-1CJK\s0 encodings, you have to
tweak a little more.  Your network connection may not accept any data
with the Most Significant Bit set, and your computer may not be able to
tell if a given byte is a whole character or just half of it.  So you
have to \fIencode\fR the character set to use it.
.Sp
A \fIcharacter encoding scheme\fR (\s-1CES\s0) determines how to encode a given
character set, or a set of multiple character sets.  7bit \s-1ISO\-2022\s0 is
an example of a \s-1CES. \s0 You switch between character sets via \fIescape
sequences\fR.
.PP
Technically, or mathematically, speaking, a character set encoded in
such a \s-1CES\s0 that maps character by character may form a \s-1CCS.  EUC\s0 is such
an example.  The \s-1CES\s0 of \s-1EUC\s0 is as follows:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Map \s-1ASCII\s0 unchanged.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Map such a character set that consists of 94 or 96 powered by N
members by adding 0x80 to each byte.
.IP "\(bu" 2
You can also use 0x8e and 0x8f to indicate that the following sequence of
characters belongs to yet another character set.  To each following byte
is added the value 0x80.
.PP
By carefully looking at the encoded byte sequence, you can find that the
byte sequence conforms a unique number.  In that sense, \s-1EUC\s0 is a \s-1CCS\s0
generated by a \s-1CES\s0 above from up to four \s-1CCS \s0(complicated?).  \s-1UTF\-8\s0
falls into this category.  See \*(L"\s-1UTF\-8\*(R"\s0 in perlUnicode to find out how
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 maps Unicode to a byte sequence.
.PP
You may also have found out by now why 7bit \s-1ISO\-2022\s0 cannot comprise
a \s-1CCS. \s0 If you look at a byte sequence \ex21\ex21, you can't tell if
it is two !'s or \s-1IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE.  EUC\s0 maps the latter to \exA1\exA1
so you have no trouble differentiating between \*(L"!!\*(R". and \*(L"\ \ \*(R".

.IP "\s-1ISO\-2022\s0" 2
.IX Item "ISO-2022"
A \s-1CES\s0 that was carefully designed to coexist with \s-1ASCII. \s0 There are a 7
bit version and an 8 bit version.
.Sp
The 7 bit version switches character set via escape sequence so it
cannot form a \s-1CCS. \s0 Since this is more difficult to handle in programs
than the 8 bit version, the 7 bit version is not very popular except for
iso\-2022\-jp, the \fIde facto\fR standard \s-1CES\s0 for e\-mails.
.Sp
The 8 bit version can form a \s-1CCS.  EUC\s0 and \s-1ISO\-8859\s0 are two examples
thereof.  Pre\-5.6 perl could use them as string literals.

.IP "\s-1UTF\-16\s0" 2
.IX Item "UTF-16"
A \s-1UTF\s0 in 16\-bit encoding.  Can either be in big endian or little
endian.  The big endian version is called \s-1UTF\-16BE \s0(equal to \s-1UCS\-2 + \s0
surrogate support) and the little endian version is called \s-1UTF\-16LE.\s0

.Dt LOGB 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm logb
.Nd return exponent as a floating-point number
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn logb "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn logbl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn logbf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn logb
functions return the exponent of x, represented as a floating-point number. 
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn logb "±0"
returns -infinity and raises the "divide-by-zero" floating-point exception.
.Pp
.Fn logb "±infinity"
returns +infinity.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn logb
functions to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vlogbf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvlogbf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvlogb "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ilogb 3
.Xr log 3
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn logb
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

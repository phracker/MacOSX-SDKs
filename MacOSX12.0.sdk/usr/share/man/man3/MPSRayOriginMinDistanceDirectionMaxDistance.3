.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Represents a 3D ray with an origin, a direction, and an intersection distance range from the origin\&. 

This type is available from the Metal Shading Language by including the MetalPerformanceShaders/MetalPerformanceShaders\&.h header\&.

.SS "\fBMPSPackedFloat3\fP MPSRayOriginMinDistanceDirectionMaxDistance::direction"

.PP
Ray direction\&. Does not need to be normalized\&. The intersection test will be skipped if the direction has length zero or contains NaNs or infinities\&. 
.SS "float MPSRayOriginMinDistanceDirectionMaxDistance::maxDistance"

.PP
Maximum intersection distance from the origin along the ray direction\&. May be infinite\&. The intersection test will be skipped if the maximum distance is less than zero, NaN, or less than the minimum intersection distance\&. 
.SS "float MPSRayOriginMinDistanceDirectionMaxDistance::minDistance"

.PP
Minimum intersection distance from the origin along the ray direction\&. The intersection test will be skipped if the minimum distance is equal to positive infinity or NaN\&. 
.SS "\fBMPSPackedFloat3\fP MPSRayOriginMinDistanceDirectionMaxDistance::origin"

.PP

(This class is part of the HTML::Tree dist.)
.PP
Objects of the HTML::Element class can be used to represent elements
of \s-1HTML\s0 document trees.  These objects have attributes, notably attributes that
designates each element's parent and content.  The content is an array
of text segments and other HTML::Element objects.  A tree with HTML::Element
objects as nodes can represent the syntax tree for a \s-1HTML\s0 document.
.SH "HOW WE REPRESENT TREES"
.IX Header "HOW WE REPRESENT TREES"
Consider this \s-1HTML\s0 document:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&  <html lang=\*(Aqen\-US\*(Aq>
\&    <head>
\&      <title>Stuff</title>
\&      <meta name=\*(Aqauthor\*(Aq content=\*(AqJojo\*(Aq>
\&    </head>
\&    <body>
\&     <h1>I like potatoes!</h1>
\&    </body>
\&  </html>
.Ve
.PP
Building a syntax tree out of it makes a tree-structure in memory
that could be diagrammed as:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&                     html (lang=\*(Aqen\-US\*(Aq)
\&                      / \e
\&                    /     \e
\&                  /         \e
\&                head        body
\&               /\e               \e
\&             /    \e               \e
\&           /        \e               \e
\&         title     meta              h1
\&          |       (name=\*(Aqauthor\*(Aq,     |
\&       "Stuff"    content=\*(AqJojo\*(Aq)    "I like potatoes"
.Ve
.PP
This is the traditional way to diagram a tree, with the \*(L"root\*(R" at the
top, and it's this kind of diagram that people have in mind when they
say, for example, that \*(L"the meta element is under the head element
instead of under the body element\*(R".  (The same is also said with
\&\*(L"inside\*(R" instead of \*(L"under\*(R" \*(-- the use of \*(L"inside\*(R" makes more sense
when you're looking at the \s-1HTML\s0 source.)
.PP
Another way to represent the above tree is with indenting:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  html (attributes: lang=\*(Aqen\-US\*(Aq)
\&    head
\&      title
\&        "Stuff"
\&      meta (attributes: name=\*(Aqauthor\*(Aq content=\*(AqJojo\*(Aq)
\&    body
\&      h1
\&        "I like potatoes"
.Ve
.PP
Incidentally, diagramming with indenting works much better for very
large trees, and is easier for a program to generate.  The \f(CW\*(C`$tree\->dump\*(C'\fR
method uses indentation just that way.
.PP
However you diagram the tree, it's stored the same in memory \*(-- it's a
network of objects, each of which has attributes like so:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  element #1:  _tag: \*(Aqhtml\*(Aq
\&               _parent: none
\&               _content: [element #2, element #5]
\&               lang: \*(Aqen\-US\*(Aq
\&
\&  element #2:  _tag: \*(Aqhead\*(Aq
\&               _parent: element #1
\&               _content: [element #3, element #4]
\&
\&  element #3:  _tag: \*(Aqtitle\*(Aq
\&               _parent: element #2
\&               _content: [text segment "Stuff"]
\&
\&  element #4   _tag: \*(Aqmeta\*(Aq
\&               _parent: element #2
\&               _content: none
\&               name: author
\&               content: Jojo
\&
\&  element #5   _tag: \*(Aqbody\*(Aq
\&               _parent: element #1
\&               _content: [element #6]
\&
\&  element #6   _tag: \*(Aqh1\*(Aq
\&               _parent: element #5
\&               _content: [text segment "I like potatoes"]
.Ve
.PP
The \*(L"treeness\*(R" of the tree-structure that these elements comprise is
not an aspect of any particular object, but is emergent from the
relatedness attributes (_parent and _content) of these element-objects
and from how you use them to get from element to element.
.PP
While you could access the content of a tree by writing code that says
"access the 'src' attribute of the root's \fIfirst\fR child's \fIseventh\fR
child's \fIthird\fR child\*(L", you're more likely to have to scan the contents
of a tree, looking for whatever nodes, or kinds of nodes, you want to
do something with.  The most straightforward way to look over a tree
is to \*(R"traverse" it; an HTML::Element method (\f(CW\*(C`$h\->traverse\*(C'\fR) is
provided for this purpose; and several other HTML::Element methods are
based on it.
.PP
(For everything you ever wanted to know about trees, and then some,
see Niklaus Wirth's \fIAlgorithms + Data Structures = Programs\fR or
Donald Knuth's \fIThe Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1\fR.)
.SS "Weak References"
.IX Subsection "Weak References"
\&\s-1TL\s0;DR summary: \f(CW\*(C`use\ HTML::TreeBuilder\ 5\ \-weak;\*(C'\fR and forget about
the \f(CW\*(C`delete\*(C'\fR method (except for pruning a node from a tree).
.PP
Because HTML::Element stores a reference to the parent element, Perl's
reference-count garbage collection doesn't work properly with
HTML::Element trees.  Starting with version 5.00, HTML::Element uses
weak references (if available) to prevent that problem.  Weak
references were introduced in Perl 5.6.0, but you also need a version
of Scalar::Util that provides the \f(CW\*(C`weaken\*(C'\fR function.
.PP
Weak references are enabled by default.  If you want to be certain
they're in use, you can say \f(CW\*(C`use\ HTML::Element\ 5\ \-weak;\*(C'\fR.  You
must include the version number; previous versions of HTML::Element
ignored the import list entirely.
.PP
To disable weak references, you can say \f(CW\*(C`use\ HTML::Element\ \-noweak;\*(C'\fR.
This is a global setting.  \fBThis feature is deprecated\fR and is
provided only as a quick fix for broken code.  If your code does not
work properly with weak references, you should fix it immediately, as
weak references may become mandatory in a future version.  Generally,
all you need to do is keep a reference to the root of the tree until
you're done working with it.
.PP
Because HTML::TreeBuilder is a subclass of HTML::Element, you can also
import \f(CW\*(C`\-weak\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-noweak\*(C'\fR from HTML::TreeBuilder: e.g.
\&\f(CW\*(C`use\ HTML::TreeBuilder:\ 5\ \-weak;\*(C'\fR.
.SH "BASIC METHODS"
.IX Header "BASIC METHODS"
.SS "new"
.IX Subsection "new"
.Vb 1
\&  $h = HTML::Element\->new(\*(Aqtag\*(Aq, \*(Aqattrname\*(Aq => \*(Aqvalue\*(Aq, ... );
.Ve
.PP
This constructor method returns a new HTML::Element object.  The tag
name is a required argument; it will be forced to lowercase.
Optionally, you can specify other initial attributes at object
creation time.
.SS "attr"
.IX Subsection "attr"
.Vb 2
\&  $value = $h\->attr(\*(Aqattr\*(Aq);
\&  $old_value = $h\->attr(\*(Aqattr\*(Aq, $new_value);
.Ve
.PP
Returns (optionally sets) the value of the given attribute of \f(CW$h\fR.  The
attribute name (but not the value, if provided) is forced to
lowercase.  If trying to read the value of an attribute not present
for this element, the return value is undef.
If setting a new value, the old value of that attribute is
returned.
.PP
If methods are provided for accessing an attribute (like \f(CW\*(C`$h\->tag\*(C'\fR for
\&\*(L"_tag\*(R", \f(CW\*(C`$h\->content_list\*(C'\fR, etc. below), use those instead of calling
attr \f(CW\*(C`$h\->attr\*(C'\fR, whether for reading or setting.
.PP
Note that setting an attribute to \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR (as opposed to "", the empty
string) actually deletes the attribute.
.SS "tag"
.IX Subsection "tag"
.Vb 2
\&  $tagname = $h\->tag();
\&  $h\->tag(\*(Aqtagname\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Returns (optionally sets) the tag name (also known as the generic
identifier) for the element \f(CW$h\fR.  In setting, the tag name is always
converted to lower case.
.PP
There are four kinds of \*(L"pseudo-elements\*(R" that show up as
HTML::Element objects:
.IP "Comment pseudo-elements" 4
.IX Item "Comment pseudo-elements"
These are element objects with a \f(CW\*(C`$h\->tag\*(C'\fR value of \*(L"~comment\*(R",
and the content of the comment is stored in the \*(L"text\*(R" attribute
(\f(CW\*(C`$h\->attr("text")\*(C'\fR).  For example, parsing this code with
HTML::TreeBuilder...
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  <!\-\- I like Pie.
\&     Pie is good
\&  \-\->
.Ve
.Sp
produces an HTML::Element object with these attributes:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  "_tag",
\&  "~comment",
\&  "text",
\&  " I like Pie.\en     Pie is good\en  "
.Ve
.IP "Declaration pseudo-elements" 4
.IX Item "Declaration pseudo-elements"
Declarations (rarely encountered) are represented as HTML::Element
objects with a tag name of \*(L"~declaration\*(R", and content in the \*(L"text\*(R"
attribute.  For example, this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  <!DOCTYPE foo>
.Ve
.Sp
produces an element whose attributes include:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  "_tag", "~declaration", "text", "DOCTYPE foo"
.Ve
.IP "Processing instruction pseudo-elements" 4
.IX Item "Processing instruction pseudo-elements"
PIs (rarely encountered) are represented as HTML::Element objects with
a tag name of \*(L"~pi\*(R", and content in the \*(L"text\*(R" attribute.  For
example, this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  <?stuff foo?>
.Ve
.Sp
produces an element whose attributes include:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  "_tag", "~pi", "text", "stuff foo?"
.Ve
.Sp
(assuming a recent version of HTML::Parser)
.IP "~literal pseudo-elements" 4
.IX Item "~literal pseudo-elements"
These objects are not currently produced by HTML::TreeBuilder, but can
be used to represent a \*(L"super-literal\*(R" \*(-- i.e., a literal you want to
be immune from escaping.  (Yes, I just made that term up.)
.Sp
That is, this is useful if you want to insert code into a tree that
you plan to dump out with \f(CW\*(C`as_HTML\*(C'\fR, where you want, for some reason,
to suppress \f(CW\*(C`as_HTML\*(C'\fR's normal behavior of amp-quoting text segments.
.Sp
For example, this:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  my $literal = HTML::Element\->new(\*(Aq~literal\*(Aq,
\&    \*(Aqtext\*(Aq => \*(Aqx < 4 & y > 7\*(Aq
\&  );
\&  my $span = HTML::Element\->new(\*(Aqspan\*(Aq);
\&  $span\->push_content($literal);
\&  print $span\->as_HTML;
.Ve
.Sp
prints this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  <span>x < 4 & y > 7</span>
.Ve
.Sp
Whereas this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  my $span = HTML::Element\->new(\*(Aqspan\*(Aq);
\&  $span\->push_content(\*(Aqx < 4 & y > 7\*(Aq);
\&    # normal text segment
\&  print $span\->as_HTML;
.Ve
.Sp
prints this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  <span>x &lt; 4 &amp; y &gt; 7</span>
.Ve
.Sp
Unless you're inserting lots of pre-cooked code into existing trees,
and dumping them out again, it's not likely that you'll find
\&\f(CW\*(C`~literal\*(C'\fR pseudo-elements useful.
.SS "parent"
.IX Subsection "parent"
.Vb 2
\&  $parent = $h\->parent();
\&  $h\->parent($new_parent);
.Ve
.PP
Returns (optionally sets) the parent (aka \*(L"container\*(R") for this element.
The parent should either be undef, or should be another element.
.PP
You \fBshould not\fR use this to directly set the parent of an element.
Instead use any of the other methods under \*(L"Structure-Modifying
Methods\*(R", below.
.PP
Note that \f(CW\*(C`not($h\->parent)\*(C'\fR is a simple test for whether \f(CW$h\fR is the
root of its subtree.
.SS "content_list"
.IX Subsection "content_list"
.Vb 2
\&  @content = $h\->content_list();
\&  $num_children = $h\->content_list();
.Ve
.PP
Returns a list of the child nodes of this element \*(-- i.e., what
nodes (elements or text segments) are inside/under this element. (Note
that this may be an empty list.)
.PP
In a scalar context, this returns the count of the items,
as you may expect.
.SS "content"
.IX Subsection "content"
.Vb 1
\&  $content_array_ref = $h\->content(); # may return undef
.Ve
.PP
This somewhat deprecated method returns the content of this element;
but unlike content_list, this returns either undef (which you should
understand to mean no content), or a \fIreference to the array\fR of
content items, each of which is either a text segment (a string, i.e.,
a defined non-reference scalar value), or an HTML::Element object.
Note that even if an arrayref is returned, it may be a reference to an
empty array.
.PP
While older code should feel free to continue to use \f(CW\*(C`$h\->content\*(C'\fR,
new code should use \f(CW\*(C`$h\->content_list\*(C'\fR in almost all conceivable
cases.  It is my experience that in most cases this leads to simpler
code anyway, since it means one can say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @children = $h\->content_list;
.Ve
.PP
instead of the inelegant:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @children = @{$h\->content || []};
.Ve
.PP
If you do use \f(CW\*(C`$h\->content\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`$h\->content_array_ref\*(C'\fR), you should not
use the reference returned by it (assuming it returned a reference,
and not undef) to directly set or change the content of an element or
text segment!  Instead use content_refs_list or any of the other
methods under \*(L"Structure-Modifying Methods\*(R", below.
.SS "content_array_ref"
.IX Subsection "content_array_ref"
.Vb 1
\&  $content_array_ref = $h\->content_array_ref(); # never undef
.Ve
.PP
This is like \f(CW\*(C`content\*(C'\fR (with all its caveats and deprecations) except
that it is guaranteed to return an array reference.  That is, if the
given node has no \f(CW\*(C`_content\*(C'\fR attribute, the \f(CW\*(C`content\*(C'\fR method would
return that undef, but \f(CW\*(C`content_array_ref\*(C'\fR would set the given node's
\&\f(CW\*(C`_content\*(C'\fR value to \f(CW\*(C`[]\*(C'\fR (a reference to a new, empty array), and
return that.
.SS "content_refs_list"
.IX Subsection "content_refs_list"
.Vb 1
\&  @content_refs = $h\->content_refs_list;
.Ve
.PP
This returns a list of scalar references to each element of \f(CW$h\fR's
content list.  This is useful in case you want to in-place edit any
large text segments without having to get a copy of the current value
of that segment value, modify that copy, then use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`splice_content\*(C'\fR to replace the old with the new.  Instead, here you
can in-place edit:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    foreach my $item_r ($h\->content_refs_list) {
\&        next if ref $$item_r;
\&        $$item_r =~ s/honour/honor/g;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
You \fIcould\fR currently achieve the same affect with:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    foreach my $item (@{ $h\->content_array_ref }) {
\&        # deprecated!
\&        next if ref $item;
\&        $item =~ s/honour/honor/g;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
\&...except that using the return value of \f(CW\*(C`$h\->content\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`$h\->content_array_ref\*(C'\fR to do that is deprecated, and just might stop
working in the future.
.SS "implicit"
.IX Subsection "implicit"
.Vb 2

Adds the specified items to the \fIend\fR of the content list of the
element \f(CW$h\fR.  The items of content to be added should each be either a
text segment (a string), an HTML::Element object, or an arrayref.
Arrayrefs are fed thru \f(CW\*(C`$h\->new_from_lol(that_arrayref)\*(C'\fR to
convert them into elements, before being added to the content
list of \f(CW$h\fR.  This means you can say things concise things like:
.PP
.Vb 6

.PP
See the \*(L"new_from_lol\*(R" method's documentation, far below, for more
explanation.
.PP
Returns \f(CW$h\fR (the element itself).

The push_content method will try to consolidate adjacent text segments
while adding to the content list.  That's to say, if \f(CW$h\fR's \f(CW\*(C`content_list\*(C'\fR is
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  (\*(Aqfoo bar \*(Aq, $some_node, \*(Aqbaz!\*(Aq)
.Ve
.PP
and you call
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $h\->push_content(\*(Aqquack?\*(Aq);

.PP
then the resulting content list will be this:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
and not this:
.PP
.Vb 1

If that latter is what you want, you'll have to override the

as in:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
Similarly, if you wanted to add 'Skronk' to the beginning of
the content list, calling this:
.PP
.Vb 1

Detaches the elements from \f(CW$h\fR's list of content-nodes, starting at
\&\f(CW$offset\fR and continuing for \f(CW$length\fR items, replacing them with the
elements of the following list, if any.  Returns the elements (if any)
removed from the content-list.  If \f(CW$offset\fR is negative, then it starts
that far from the end of the array, just like Perl's normal \f(CW\*(C`splice\*(C'\fR
function.  If \f(CW$length\fR and the following list is omitted, removes
everything from \f(CW$offset\fR onward.

The items of content to be added (if any) should each be either a text

.Ve
.PP
This unlinks \f(CW$h\fR from its parent, by setting its 'parent' attribute to
undef, and by removing it from the content list of its parent (if it
had one).  The return value is the parent that was detached from (or
undef, if \f(CW$h\fR had no parent to start with).  Note that neither \f(CW$h\fR nor
its parent are explicitly destroyed.
.SS "detach_content"

This unlinks all of \f(CW$h\fR's children from \f(CW$h\fR, and returns them.

This replaces \f(CW$h\fR in its parent's content list with the nodes
specified.  The element \f(CW$h\fR (which by then may have no parent)
is returned.  This causes a fatal error if \f(CW$h\fR has no parent.
The list of nodes to insert may contain \f(CW$h\fR, but at most once.
Aside from that possible exception, the nodes to insert should not
already be children of \f(CW$h\fR's parent.

None of the given nodes should be \f(CW$h\fR or other children of \f(CW$h\fR.
Returns \f(CW$h\fR.
.SS "postinsert"

Inserts the given nodes right \s-1AFTER\s0 \f(CW$h\fR in \f(CW$h\fR's parent's content

Detaches this element from its parent (if it has one) and explicitly

the empty list (or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR in scalar context).
.PP
Before version 5.00 of HTML::Element, you had to call \f(CW\*(C`delete\*(C'\fR when

Returns a copy of the element (whose children are clones (recursively)
of the original's children, if any).
.PP
The returned element is parentless.  Any '_pos' attributes present in the
source element/tree will be absent in the copy.  For that and other reasons,
the clone of an HTML::TreeBuilder object that's in mid-parse (i.e, the head
of a tree that HTML::TreeBuilder is elaborating) cannot (currently) be used
to continue the parse.
.PP
You are free to clone HTML::TreeBuilder trees, just as long as:
1) they're done being parsed, or 2) you don't expect to resume parsing
into the clone.  (You can continue parsing into the original; it is
never affected.)
.SS "clone_list"

Text segments are simply copied; elements are cloned by
calling \f(CW\*(C`$it\->clone\*(C'\fR on each of them.
.PP
Note that this must be called as a class method, not as an instance
method.  \f(CW\*(C`clone_list\*(C'\fR will croak if called as an instance method.

This traverses under \f(CW$h\fR and deletes any text segments that are ignorable
whitespace.  You should not use this if \f(CW$h\fR is under a \f(CW\*(C`<pre>\*(C'\fR element.
.SS "insert_element"
.IX Subsection "insert_element"
.Vb 1
\&  $h\->insert_element($element, $implicit);
.Ve
.PP
Inserts (via push_content) a new element under the element at
\&\f(CW\*(C`$h\->pos()\*(C'\fR.  Then updates \f(CW\*(C`$h\->pos()\*(C'\fR to point to the inserted
element, unless \f(CW$element\fR is a prototypically empty element like
\&\f(CW\*(C`<br>\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`<hr>\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`<img>\*(C'\fR, etc.
The new \f(CW\*(C`$h\->pos()\*(C'\fR is returned.  This

intented, using the string you specify (which you probably should
set to \*(L"\et\*(R", or some number of spaces, if you specify it).
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`\e%optional_end_tags\*(C'\fR is specified and defined, it should be
a reference to a hash that holds a true value for every tag name
whose end tag is optional.  Defaults to

\&\f(CW%HTML::Tagset::optionalEndTag\fR, which, at time of writing, contains
true values for \f(CW\*(C`p, li, dt, dd\*(C'\fR.  A useful value to pass is an empty
hashref, \f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR, which means that no end-tags are optional for this dump.
Otherwise, possibly consider copying \f(CW%HTML::Tagset::optionalEndTag\fR to a
hash of your own, adding or deleting values as you like, and passing
a reference to that hash.

whitespace may be ignored or compacted by HTML::TreeBuilder during
parsing (depending on the value of the \f(CW\*(C`ignore_ignorable_whitespace\*(C'\fR

.PP
That is, a particular \f(CW\*(C`<p>\*(C'\fR element may happen to have no content, so
\&\f(CW$that_p_element\fR\->is_empty will be true \*(-- even though the prototypical
\&\f(CW\*(C`<p>\*(C'\fR element isn't \*(L"empty\*(R" (not in the way that the prototypical

.PP
In list context: returns all the nodes that're the left siblings of \f(CW$h\fR

.SS "address"
.IX Subsection "address"
.Vb 2
\&  $address = $h\->address();

.Ve
.PP
The first form (with no parameter) returns a string representing the
location of \f(CW$h\fR in the tree it is a member of.
The address consists of numbers joined by a '.', starting with '0',
and followed by the pindexes of the nodes in the tree that are
ancestors of \f(CW$h\fR, starting from the top.
.PP
So if the way to get to a node starting at the root is to go to child
2 of the root, then child 10 of that, and then child 0 of that, and
then you're there \*(-- then that node's address is \*(L"0.2.10.0\*(R".
.PP
As a bit of a special case, the address of the root is simply \*(L"0\*(R".
.PP
I forsee this being used mainly for debugging, but you may
find your own uses for it.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $element_or_text = $h\->address($address);
.Ve
.PP
This form returns the node (whether element or text-segment) at
the given address in the tree that \f(CW$h\fR is a part of.  (That is,
the address is resolved starting from \f(CW\*(C`$h\->root\*(C'\fR.)
.PP
If there is no node at the given address, this returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You can specify \*(L"relative addressing\*(R" (i.e., that indexing is supposed
to start from \f(CW$h\fR and not from \f(CW\*(C`$h\->root\*(C'\fR) by having the address start
with a period \*(-- e.g., \f(CW\*(C`$h\->address(".3.2")\*(C'\fR will look at child 3 of \f(CW$h\fR,

.Vb 1
\&  $depth = $h\->depth();
.Ve
.PP
Returns a number expressing \f(CW$h\fR's depth within its tree, i.e., how many
steps away it is from the root.  If \f(CW$h\fR has no parent (i.e., is root),
its depth is 0.
.SS "root"
.IX Subsection "root"
.Vb 1
\&  $root = $h\->root();
.Ve
.PP
Returns the element that's the top of \f(CW$h\fR's tree.  If \f(CW$h\fR is
root, this just returns \f(CW$h\fR.  (If you want to test whether \f(CW$h\fR
\&\fIis\fR the root, instead of asking what its root is, just test

.IX Subsection "lineage"
.Vb 1
\&  @lineage = $h\->lineage();
.Ve
.PP
Returns the list of \f(CW$h\fR's ancestors, starting with its parent,
and then that parent's parent, and so on, up to the root.  If \f(CW$h\fR
is root, this returns an empty list.
.PP

.PP
Returns the list of the tag names of \f(CW$h\fR's ancestors, starting
with its parent, and that parent's parent, and so on, up to the
root.  If \f(CW$h\fR is root, this returns an empty list.

In list context, returns the list of all \f(CW$h\fR's descendant elements,
listed in pre-order (i.e., an element appears before its
content-elements).  Text segments \s-1DO NOT\s0 appear in the list.
In scalar context, returns a count of all such elements.

.Ve
.PP
In list context, returns a list of elements at or under \f(CW$h\fR that have
any of the specified tag names.  In scalar context, returns the first

none.
.SS "find"

This is just an alias to \f(CW\*(C`find_by_tag_name\*(C'\fR.  (There was once
going to be a whole find_* family of methods, but then \f(CW\*(C`look_down\*(C'\fR
filled that niche, so there turned out not to be much reason for the

.Ve
.PP
In a list context, returns a list of elements at or under \f(CW$h\fR that have
the specified attribute, and have the given value for that attribute.
In a scalar context, returns the first (in pre-order traversal of the
tree) such element found, or undef if none.
.PP
This method is \fBdeprecated\fR in favor of the more expressive
\&\f(CW\*(C`look_down\*(C'\fR method, which new code should use instead.
.SS "look_down"
.IX Subsection "look_down"
.Vb 2
\&  @elements = $h\->look_down( ...criteria... );
\&  $first_match = $h\->look_down( ...criteria... );
.Ve
.PP
This starts at \f(CW$h\fR and looks thru its element descendants (in
pre-order), looking for elements matching the criteria you specify.
In list context, returns all elements that match all the given
criteria; in scalar context, returns the first such element (or undef,
if nothing matched).
.PP
There are three kinds of criteria you can specify:
.IP "(attr_name, attr_value)" 4
.IX Item "(attr_name, attr_value)"
This means you're looking for an element with that value for that
attribute.  Example: \f(CW"alt", "pix!"\fR.  Consider that you can search
on internal attribute values too: \f(CW"_tag", "p"\fR.
.IP "(attr_name, qr/.../)" 4
.IX Item "(attr_name, qr/.../)"
This means you're looking for an element whose value for that
attribute matches the specified Regexp object.
.IP "a coderef" 4
.IX Item "a coderef"
This means you're looking for elements where coderef\->(each_element)
returns true.  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  my @wide_pix_images = $h\->look_down(
\&    _tag => "img",
\&    alt  => "pix!",
\&    sub { $_[0]\->attr(\*(Aqwidth\*(Aq) > 350 }
\&  );
.Ve
.PP
Note that \f(CW\*(C`(attr_name, attr_value)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`(attr_name, qr/.../)\*(C'\fR
criteria are almost always faster than coderef
criteria, so should presumably be put before them in your list of
criteria.  That is, in the example above, the sub ref is called only
for elements that have already passed the criteria of having a \*(L"_tag\*(R"
attribute with value \*(L"img\*(R", and an \*(L"alt\*(R" attribute with value \*(L"pix!\*(R".
If the coderef were first, it would be called on every element, and
\&\fIthen\fR what elements pass that criterion (i.e., elements for which
the coderef returned true) would be checked for their \*(L"_tag\*(R" and \*(L"alt\*(R"
attributes.
.PP
Note that comparison of string attribute-values against the string
value in \f(CW\*(C`(attr_name, attr_value)\*(C'\fR is case-INsensitive!  A criterion
of \f(CW\*(C`(\*(Aqalign\*(Aq, \*(Aqright\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR \fIwill\fR match an element whose \*(L"align\*(R" value
is \*(L"\s-1RIGHT\*(R",\s0 or \*(L"right\*(R" or \*(L"rIGhT\*(R", etc.
.PP
Note also that \f(CW\*(C`look_down\*(C'\fR considers "" (empty-string) and undef to
be different things, in attribute values.  So this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $h\->look_down("alt", "")
.Ve
.PP
will find elements \fIwith\fR an \*(L"alt\*(R" attribute, but where the value for
the \*(L"alt\*(R" attribute is "".  But this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $h\->look_down("alt", undef)
.Ve
.PP
is the same as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $h\->look_down(sub { !defined($_[0]\->attr(\*(Aqalt\*(Aq)) } )
.Ve
.PP
That is, it finds elements that do not have an \*(L"alt\*(R" attribute at all
(or that do have an \*(L"alt\*(R" attribute, but with a value of undef \*(--
which is not normally possible).
.PP
Note that when you give several criteria, this is taken to mean you're
looking for elements that match \fIall\fR your criterion, not just \fIany\fR
of them.  In other words, there is an implicit \*(L"and\*(R", not an \*(L"or\*(R".  So
if you wanted to express that you wanted to find elements with a
\&\*(L"name\*(R" attribute with the value \*(L"foo\*(R" \fIor\fR with an \*(L"id\*(R" attribute
with the value \*(L"baz\*(R", you'd have to do it like:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  @them = $h\->look_down(
\&    sub {
\&      # the lcs are to fold case
\&      lc($_[0]\->attr(\*(Aqname\*(Aq)) eq \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq
\&      or lc($_[0]\->attr(\*(Aqid\*(Aq)) eq \*(Aqbaz\*(Aq
\&    }
\&  );
.Ve
.PP
Coderef criteria are more expressive than \f(CW\*(C`(attr_name, attr_value)\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`(attr_name, qr/.../)\*(C'\fR
criteria, and all \f(CW\*(C`(attr_name, attr_value)\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`(attr_name, qr/.../)\*(C'\fR
criteria could be
expressed in terms of coderefs.  However, \f(CW\*(C`(attr_name, attr_value)\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`(attr_name, qr/.../)\*(C'\fR
criteria are a convenient shorthand.  (In fact, \f(CW\*(C`look_down\*(C'\fR itself is
basically \*(L"shorthand\*(R" too, since anything you can do with \f(CW\*(C`look_down\*(C'\fR
you could do by traversing the tree, either with the \f(CW\*(C`traverse\*(C'\fR
method or with a routine of your own.  However, \f(CW\*(C`look_down\*(C'\fR often
makes for very concise and clear code.)

.Vb 2
\&  @elements = $h\->look_up( ...criteria... );

This is identical to \f(CW\*(C`$h\->look_down\*(C'\fR, except that whereas

basically scans over the list:

And printing \f(CW$h\fR\->as_HTML will give something like:

You can even do fancy things with \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 10

\&      qw(Peaches Apples Pears Mangos)
\&    ],
\&  );
.Ve
.PP
In scalar context, you must supply exactly one arrayref.  In list
context, you can pass a list of arrayrefs, and new_from_lol will
return a list of elements, one for each arrayref.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  @elements = HTML::Element\->new_from_lol(
\&    [\*(Aqhr\*(Aq],
\&    [\*(Aqp\*(Aq, \*(AqAnd there, on the door, was a hook!\*(Aq],

\&   # constructs two elements.

.SS "objectify_text"
.IX Subsection "objectify_text"
.Vb 1
\&  $h\->objectify_text();
.Ve
.PP
This turns any text nodes under \f(CW$h\fR from mere text segments (strings)
into real objects, pseudo-elements with a tag-name of \*(L"~text\*(R", and the
actual text content in an attribute called \*(L"text\*(R".  (For a discussion
of pseudo-elements, see the \*(L"tag\*(R" method, far above.)  This method is
provided because, for some purposes, it is convenient or necessary to
be able, for a given text node, to ask what element is its parent; and
clearly this is not possible if a node is just a text string.
.PP
Note that these \*(L"~text\*(R" objects are not recognized as text nodes by
methods like \*(L"as_text\*(R".  Presumably you will want to call
\&\f(CW\*(C`$h\->objectify_text\*(C'\fR, perform whatever task that you needed that for,
and then call \f(CW\*(C`$h\->deobjectify_text\*(C'\fR before calling anything like
\&\f(CW\*(C`$h\->as_text\*(C'\fR.
.SS "deobjectify_text"
.IX Subsection "deobjectify_text"
.Vb 1
\&  $h\->deobjectify_text();
.Ve
.PP
This undoes the effect of \f(CW\*(C`$h\->objectify_text\*(C'\fR.  That is, it takes any
\&\*(L"~text\*(R" pseudo-elements in the tree at/under \f(CW$h\fR, and deletes each one,
replacing each with the content of its \*(L"text\*(R" attribute.
.PP
Note that if \f(CW$h\fR itself is a \*(L"~text\*(R" pseudo-element, it will be
destroyed \*(-- a condition you may need to treat specially in your
calling code (since it means you can't very well do anything with \f(CW$h\fR
after that).  So that you can detect that condition, if \f(CW$h\fR is itself a
\&\*(L"~text\*(R" pseudo-element, then this method returns the value of the
\&\*(L"text\*(R" attribute, which should be a defined value; in all other cases,
it returns undef.
.PP
(This method assumes that no \*(L"~text\*(R" pseudo-element has any children.)
.SS "number_lists"
.IX Subsection "number_lists"
.Vb 1
\&  $h\->number_lists();
.Ve
.PP
For every \s-1UL, OL, DIR,\s0 and \s-1MENU\s0 element at/under \f(CW$h\fR, this sets a
\&\*(L"_bullet\*(R" attribute for every child \s-1LI\s0 element.  For \s-1LI\s0 children of an
\&\s-1OL,\s0 the \*(L"_bullet\*(R" attribute's value will be something like \*(L"4.\*(R", \*(L"d.\*(R",
\&\*(L"D.\*(R", \*(L"\s-1IV.\*(R",\s0 or \*(L"iv.\*(R", depending on the \s-1OL\s0 element's \*(L"type\*(R" attribute.
\&\s-1LI\s0 children of a \s-1UL, DIR,\s0 or \s-1MENU\s0 get their \*(L"_bullet\*(R" attribute set
to \*(L"*\*(R".
There should be no other LIs (i.e., except as children of \s-1OL, UL, DIR,\s0
or \s-1MENU\s0 elements), and if there are, they are unaffected.
.SS "has_insane_linkage"
.IX Subsection "has_insane_linkage"
.Vb 1
\&  $h\->has_insane_linkage
.Ve
.PP
This method is for testing whether this element or the elements
under it have linkage attributes (_parent and _content) whose values
are deeply aberrant: if there are undefs in a content list; if an
element appears in the content lists of more than one element;
if the _parent attribute of an element doesn't match its actual
parent; or if an element appears as its own descendant (i.e.,
if there is a cyclicity in the tree).
.PP
This returns empty list (or false, in scalar context) if the subtree's
linkage methods are sane; otherwise it returns two items (or true, in
scalar context): the element where the error occurred, and a string
describing the error.
.PP
This method is provided is mainly for debugging and troubleshooting \*(--
it should be \fIquite impossible\fR for any document constructed via
HTML::TreeBuilder to parse into a non-sane tree (since it's not
the content of the tree per se that's in question, but whether
the tree in memory was properly constructed); and it \fIshould\fR be
impossible for you to produce an insane tree just thru reasonable
use of normal documented structure-modifying methods.  But if you're
constructing your own trees, and your program is going into infinite
loops as during calls to \fBtraverse()\fR or any of the secondary
structural methods, as part of debugging, consider calling
\&\f(CW\*(C`has_insane_linkage\*(C'\fR on the tree.
.SS "element_class"
.IX Subsection "element_class"
.Vb 1
\&  $classname = $h\->element_class();
.Ve
.PP
This method returns the class which will be used for new elements.  It
defaults to HTML::Element, but can be overridden by subclassing or esoteric
means best left to those will will read the source and then not complain when
those esoteric means change.  (Just subclass.)

\&  $enabled = HTML::Element\->Use_Weak_Refs;

.Ve
.PP
This method allows you to check whether weak reference support is
enabled, and to enable or disable it. For details, see \*(L"Weak References\*(R".
\&\f(CW$enabled\fR is true if weak references are enabled.
.PP
You should not switch this in the middle of your program, and you
probably shouldn't use it at all.  Existing trees are not affected by
this method (until you start modifying nodes in them).
.PP
Throws an exception if you attempt to enable weak references and your
Perl or Scalar::Util does not support them.
.PP
Disabling weak reference support is deprecated.

.IX Header "BUGS"
* If you want to free the memory associated with a tree built of
HTML::Element nodes, and you have disabled weak references, then you
will have to delete it explicitly using the \*(L"delete\*(R" method.
See \*(L"Weak References\*(R".
.PP
* There's almost nothing to stop you from making a \*(L"tree\*(R" with
cyclicities (loops) in it, which could, for example, make the
traverse method go into an infinite loop.  So don't make
cyclicities!  (If all you're doing is parsing \s-1HTML\s0 files,
and looking at the resulting trees, this will never be a problem
for you.)
.PP
* There's no way to represent comments or processing directives
in a tree with HTML::Elements.  Not yet, at least.
.PP
* There's (currently) nothing to stop you from using an undefined
value as a text segment.  If you're running under \f(CW\*(C`perl \-w\*(C'\fR, however,
this may make HTML::Element's code produce a slew of warnings.
.SH "NOTES ON SUBCLASSING"
.IX Header "NOTES ON SUBCLASSING"
You are welcome to derive subclasses from HTML::Element, but you
should be aware that the code in HTML::Element makes certain
assumptions about elements (and I'm using \*(L"element\*(R" to mean \s-1ONLY\s0 an
object of class HTML::Element, or of a subclass of HTML::Element):
.PP
* The value of an element's _parent attribute must either be undef or
otherwise false, or must be an element.
.PP
* The value of an element's _content attribute must either be undef or
otherwise false, or a reference to an (unblessed) array.  The array
may be empty; but if it has items, they must \s-1ALL\s0 be either mere
strings (text segments), or elements.
.PP
* The value of an element's _tag attribute should, at least, be a
string of printable characters.
.PP
Moreover, bear these rules in mind:
.PP
* Do not break encapsulation on objects.  That is, access their
contents only thru \f(CW$obj\fR\->attr or more specific methods.
.PP
* You should think twice before completely overriding any of the
methods that HTML::Element provides.  (Overriding with a method that
calls the superclass method is not so bad, though.)

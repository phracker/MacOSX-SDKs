.SH NAME

\- control the writing of individual bits in the color index buffers

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glIndexMask\fP(
GLuint \fImask\fP )
.nf
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2mask\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2mask\fP
Specifies a bit mask to enable and disable the writing of individual bits
in the color index buffers.
Initially, the mask is all 1's.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glIndexMask\fP controls the writing of individual bits in the color index buffers.
The least significant n bits of \f2mask\fP,
where n is the number of bits in a color index buffer,
specify a mask.
Where a 1 (one) appears in the mask,
it's possible to write to the corresponding bit in the color index
buffer (or buffers). 
Where a 0 (zero) appears,
the corresponding bit is write-protected.
.P
This mask is used only in color index mode,
and it affects only the buffers currently selected for writing
(see \%\f3glDrawBuffer\fP).
Initially, all bits are enabled for writing.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glIndexMask\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_INDEX_WRITEMASK\fP

.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Intersection result which contains the distance from the ray origin to the intersection point, the index of the intersected primitive, the index of the intersected instance, and the first two barycentric coordinates of the intersection point\&. 

This type is available from the Metal Shading Language by including the MetalPerformanceShaders/MetalPerformanceShaders\&.h header\&.

.SS "vector_float2 MPSIntersectionDistancePrimitiveIndexInstanceIndexCoordinates::coordinates"

.PP
The first two barycentric coordinates U and V of the intersection point\&. The third coordinate W = 1 - U - V\&. Undefined if the ray does not intersect a primitive or if the intersection type is MPSIntersectionTypeAny\&. 
.SS "float MPSIntersectionDistancePrimitiveIndexInstanceIndexCoordinates::distance"

.PP
Distance from the ray origin to the intersection point along the ray direction vector such that intersection = ray\&.origin + ray\&.direction * distance\&. Is negative if there is no intersection\&. If the intersection type is MPSIntersectionTypeAny, is a positive value for a hit or a negative value for a miss\&. 
.SS "unsigned int MPSIntersectionDistancePrimitiveIndexInstanceIndexCoordinates::instanceIndex"

.PP
Index of the intersected instance\&. Undefined if the ray does not intersect a primitive, if the acceleration structure is not an instance acceleration structure, or if the intersection type is MPSIntersectionTypeAny\&. 
.SS "unsigned int MPSIntersectionDistancePrimitiveIndexInstanceIndexCoordinates::primitiveIndex"

.PP
Index of the intersected primitive\&. Undefined if the ray does not intersect a primitive or if the intersection type is MPSIntersectionTypeAny\&.

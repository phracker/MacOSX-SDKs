.Sh NAME
.Nm ilogb
.Nd return exponent as an integer value
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft int
.Fn ilogb "double x"
.Ft int
.Fn ilogbl "long double x"
.Ft int
.Fn ilogbf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ilogb
functions return the exponent of x as a signed integer value. 
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn ilogb "±0"
returns FP_ILOGB0.
.Pp
.Fn ilogb "±infinity"
returns INT_MAX.
.Pp
.Fn ilogb "x"
returns FP_ILOGBNAN if x is a NaN.
.Pp
A range error may occur if x is 0, ±infinity, or a nan.
.Pp
The special return values FP_ILOGB0 and FP_ILOGBNAN are
defined in math.h, and may differ between platforms.
INT_MAX is defined in limits.h.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn ilogb
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

This interface is obsoleted by

.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn nice
function obtains the scheduling priority of the process
from the system and sets it to the priority value specified in
.Fa incr .
The priority is a value in the range -20 to 20.
The default priority is 0; lower priorities cause more favorable scheduling.
Only the super-user may lower priorities.
.Pp
Children inherit the priority of their parent processes via
.Xr fork 2 .

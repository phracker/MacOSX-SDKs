\f2pixels\fP
Specifies a pointer to the pixel data.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glDrawPixels\fP reads pixel data from memory and writes it into the frame buffer
.br
relative to the current raster position, provided that the raster
position is valid.  Use 
.br
\%\f3glRasterPos\fP to set the current raster position; use
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION_VALID\fP
to determine if the specified raster position is valid, and 
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION\fP
to query the raster position.
.P
Several parameters define the encoding of pixel data in memory
and control the processing of the pixel data
before it is placed in the frame buffer.
These parameters are set with four commands:
\%\f3glPixelStore\fP,
\%\f3glPixelTransfer\fP,
\%\f3glPixelMap\fP, and \%\f3glPixelZoom\fP.
This reference page describes the effects on \%\f3glDrawPixels\fP of many,
but not all, of the parameters specified by these four commands.
.P
Data is read from \f2pixels\fP as a sequence of signed or unsigned bytes,
signed or unsigned shorts, signed or unsigned integers, or
single-precision floating-point values, depending on \f2type\fP.  
When \f2type\fP is one of \%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE\fP, \%\f3GL_BYTE\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT\fP, \%\f3GL_SHORT\fP, \%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_INT\fP,
\%\f3GL_INT\fP, or \%\f3GL_FLOAT\fP each of these bytes, shorts, integers, or
floating-point values is interpreted as one color or depth component, or
one index, depending on \f2format\fP.
When \f2type\fP is one of \%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5\fP, \%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1\fP, \%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2\fP, each unsigned value is interpreted as
containing all the components for a single pixel, with the color
components arranged according to \f2format\fP.
When \f2type\fP is one of \%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV\fP, \%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV\fP, \%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV\fP, each unsigned value is interpreted
as containing all color components, specified by \f2format\fP, for a single
pixel in a reversed order. Indices are always treated individually.
Color components are treated as groups of one, two, three, or four
values, again based on \f2format\fP. Both individual indices and groups of
components are referred to as pixels.
If \f2type\fP is \%\f3GL_BITMAP\fP, the data must be unsigned bytes, and
\f2format\fP must be either \%\f3GL_COLOR_INDEX\fP or \%\f3GL_STENCIL_INDEX\fP.
Each unsigned byte is treated as eight 1-bit pixels, with bit ordering
determined by \%\f3GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST\fP (see \%\f3glPixelStore\fP).
.P
\f2width\fP * \f2height\fP pixels are read from memory,
starting at location \f2pixels\fP.
By default, these pixels are taken from adjacent memory locations,
except that after all \f2width\fP pixels are read,
the read pointer is advanced to the next four-byte boundary.
The four-byte row alignment is specified by \%\f3glPixelStore\fP with
argument \%\f3GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT\fP,
and it can be set to one, two, four, or eight bytes.
Other pixel store parameters specify different read pointer advancements,
both before the first pixel is read
and after all \f2width\fP pixels are read.
See the \%\f3glPixelStore\fP reference page for details on these options.
.P
The \f2width\fP * \f2height\fP pixels that are read from memory are
each operated on in the same way,
based on the values of several parameters specified by \%\f3glPixelTransfer\fP
and \%\f3glPixelMap\fP.
The details of these operations,
as well as the target buffer into which the pixels are drawn,
are specific to the format of the pixels,
as specified by \f2format\fP.
\f2format\fP can assume one of 13 symbolic values:
.TP 10
\%\f3GL_COLOR_INDEX\fP
Each pixel is a single value,
a color index.
It is converted to fixed-point ,
with an unspecified number of bits to the right of the binary point,
regardless of the memory data type.
Floating-point values convert to true fixed-point values.
Signed and unsigned integer data is converted with all fraction bits
set to 0.
Bitmap data convert to either 0 or 1.
.IP
Each fixed-point index is then shifted left by \%\f3GL_INDEX_SHIFT\fP bits
and added to \%\f3GL_INDEX_OFFSET\fP.
If \%\f3GL_INDEX_SHIFT\fP is negative,
the shift is to the right.
In either case, zero bits fill otherwise unspecified bit locations in the
result.
.IP
If the GL is in RGBA mode,
the resulting index is converted to an RGBA pixel 
with the help of the \%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_R\fP, 
\%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_G\fP,
\%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_B\fP,
and \%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_A\fP tables.
If the GL is in color index mode,
and if \%\f3GL_MAP_COLOR\fP is true,
the index is replaced with the value that it references in lookup table
\%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I\fP.
Whether the lookup replacement of the index is done or not,
the integer part of the index is then ANDed with (2^b) -1,
where b is the number of bits in a color index buffer.
.BP
.IP
The GL then converts the resulting indices or RGBA colors to fragments
by attaching the current raster position \f2z\fP coordinate and
texture coordinates to each pixel,
then assigning x and y window coordinates to the nth fragment such that
.sp

.ce
xn = xr + n mod width 

.ce
yn = yr + n/width

.sp
.IP
where (xr, yr) is the current raster position.
These pixel fragments are then treated just like the fragments generated by
rasterizing points, lines, or polygons.
Texture mapping,
fog,
and all the fragment operations are applied before the fragments are written
to the frame buffer.
.TP
\%\f3GL_STENCIL_INDEX\fP
Each pixel is a single value,
a stencil index.
It is converted to fixed-point ,
with an unspecified number of bits to the right of the binary point,
regardless of the memory data type.
Floating-point values convert to true fixed-point values.
Signed and unsigned integer data is converted with all fraction bits
set to 0.
Bitmap data convert to either 0 or 1.
.IP
Each fixed-point index is then shifted left by \%\f3GL_INDEX_SHIFT\fP bits,
and added to \%\f3GL_INDEX_OFFSET\fP.
If \%\f3GL_INDEX_SHIFT\fP is negative,
the shift is to the right.
In either case, zero bits fill otherwise unspecified bit locations in the
result.
If \%\f3GL_MAP_STENCIL\fP is true,
the index is replaced with the value that it references in lookup table
\%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_S_TO_S\fP.
Whether the lookup replacement of the index is done or not,
the integer part of the index is then ANDed with (2^b)-1,
where b is the number of bits in the stencil buffer.
The resulting stencil indices are then written to the stencil buffer
such that the nth index is written to location
.P

.ce
xn = xr + n mod width 

.ce
yn = yr + n/width

.IP
where (xr , yr) is the current raster position.
Only the pixel ownership test,
the scissor test,
and the stencil writemask affect these write operations.
.TP
\%\f3GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT\fP
Each pixel is a single-depth component.
Floating-point data is converted directly to an internal floating-point
 with unspecified precision.
Signed integer data is mapped linearly to the internal floating-point
 such that the most positive representable integer value maps to 1.0,
and the most negative representable value maps to \-1.0.
Unsigned integer data is mapped similarly:
the largest integer value maps to 1.0,
and 0 maps to 0.0.
The resulting floating-point depth value is then multiplied
by \%\f3GL_DEPTH_SCALE\fP and added to \%\f3GL_DEPTH_BIAS\fP.
The result is clamped to the range [0,1].
.IP
The GL then converts the resulting depth components to fragments
by attaching the current raster position color or color index and
texture coordinates to each pixel,
then assigning x and y window coordinates to the nth fragment such that
.P

.ce
xn = xr + n mod width 

.ce
yn = yr + n/width

.IP
where (xr , yr) is the current raster position.
These pixel fragments are then treated just like the fragments generated by
rasterizing points, lines, or polygons.
Texture mapping,
fog,
and all the fragment operations are applied before the fragments are written
to the frame buffer.
.TP
\%\f3GL_RGBA\fP
.TP
\%\f3GL_BGRA\fP
Each pixel is a four-component group: for \%\f3GL_RGBA\fP, the red
component is first, followed by green, followed by blue, followed by 
alpha; for \%\f3GL_BGRA\fP the order is blue, green, red and then alpha.
Floating-point values are converted directly to an internal floating-point
 with unspecified precision.
Signed integer values are mapped linearly to the internal floating-point
 such that the most positive representable integer value maps to 1.0,
and the most negative representable value maps to \-1.0. (Note that
this mapping does not convert 0 precisely to 0.0.)
Unsigned integer data is mapped similarly:
the largest integer value maps to 1.0,
and 0 maps to 0.0.
The resulting floating-point color values are then multiplied
by \%\f3GL_c_SCALE\fP and added to \%\f3GL_c_BIAS\fP,
where \f2c\fP is RED, GREEN, BLUE, and ALPHA
for the respective color components.
The results are clamped to the range [0,1].
.IP
If \%\f3GL_MAP_COLOR\fP is true,
each color component is scaled by the size of lookup table
\%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_c_TO_c\fP,
then replaced by the value that it references in that table.
\f2c\fP is R, G, B, or A respectively.
.BP
.IP
The GL then converts the resulting RGBA colors to fragments
by attaching the current raster position \f2z\fP coordinate and
texture coordinates to each pixel,
then assigning x and y window coordinates to the nth fragment such that
.P

.ce
xn = xr + n mod width 

.ce
yn = yr + n/width

.IP
where (xr , yr) is the current raster position.
These pixel fragments are then treated just like the fragments generated by
rasterizing points, lines, or polygons.
Texture mapping,
fog,
and all the fragment operations are applied before the fragments are written
to the frame buffer.
.TP
\%\f3GL_RED\fP
Each pixel is a single red component.
This component is converted to the internal floating-point  in
the same way the red component of an RGBA pixel is. It is
then converted to an RGBA pixel with green and blue set to 0,
and alpha set to 1.
After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read
as an RGBA pixel.
.TP
\%\f3GL_GREEN\fP
Each pixel is a single green component.
This component is converted to the internal floating-point  in
the same way the green component of an RGBA pixel is.
It is then converted to an RGBA pixel with red and blue set to 0,
and alpha set to 1.
After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read
as an RGBA pixel.
.TP
\%\f3GL_BLUE\fP
Each pixel is a single blue component.
This component is converted to the internal floating-point  in
the same way the blue component of an RGBA pixel is.
It is then converted to an RGBA pixel with red and green set to 0,
and alpha set to 1.
After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read
as an RGBA pixel.
.TP
\%\f3GL_ALPHA\fP
Each pixel is a single alpha component.
This component is converted to the internal floating-point  in
the same way the alpha component of an RGBA pixel is.
It is then converted to an RGBA pixel with red, green, and blue set to 0.
After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read
as an RGBA pixel.
.BP
.TP
\%\f3GL_RGB\fP
.TP
\%\f3GL_BGR\fP
Each pixel is a three-component group:
red first, followed by green, followed by blue; for \%\f3GL_BGR\fP, the
first component is blue, followed by green and then red.
Each component is converted to the internal floating-point  in
the same way the red, green, and blue components of an RGBA pixel are.
The color triple is converted to an RGBA pixel with alpha set to 1.
After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read
as an RGBA pixel.
.TP
\%\f3GL_LUMINANCE\fP
Each pixel is a single luminance component.
This component is converted to the internal floating-point  in
the same way the red component of an RGBA pixel is.
It is then converted to an RGBA pixel with red, green, and blue set to the
converted luminance value,
and alpha set to 1.
After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read
as an RGBA pixel.
.TP
\%\f3GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA\fP
Each pixel is a two-component group:
luminance first, followed by alpha.
The two components are converted to the internal floating-point  in
the same way the red component of an RGBA pixel is.
They are then converted to an RGBA pixel with red, green, and blue set to the
converted luminance value,
and alpha set to the converted alpha value.
After this conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had been read
as an RGBA pixel.

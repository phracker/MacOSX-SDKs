.Sh NAME
.Nm atan
.Nd arc tangent function of one variable
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn atan "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn atanl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn atanf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn atan
function computes the principal value of the arc tangent of
.Fa x .
The result is in the range
.Bk -words
.Bq -\*(Pi/2 , +\*(Pi/2 .
.Ek
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn atan "±0"
returns ±0.
.Pp
.Fn atan "±infinity"
returns ±pi/2
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn atan
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vatanf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvatanf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvatan "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;

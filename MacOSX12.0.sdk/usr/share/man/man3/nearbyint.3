.Sh NAME
.Nm nearbyint
.Nd round to integral value in floating-point format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn nearbyint "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn nearbyintl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn nearbyintf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn nearbyint
functions return the integral value (represented as a double precision number)
nearest to
.Fa x
according to the prevailing rounding mode.
.Pp
.Fn nearbyint
is the same as
.Fn rint ,
except that nearbyint is guaranteed never to set floating point flags
or trigger floating point exceptions (which are disabled by default).
.Fn rint
is typically much more performant than
.Fn nearbyint
if the application does not depend on flags being preserved.
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn nearbyint "±0"
returns ±0 for all rounding modes.
.Pp
.Fn nearbyint "±infinity"
returns ±infinity for all rounding modes.

.Xr floor 3
.Xr round 3
.Xr trunc 3
.Xr lround 3
.Xr lrint 3
.Xr llround 3
.Xr llrint 3
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn nearbyint
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

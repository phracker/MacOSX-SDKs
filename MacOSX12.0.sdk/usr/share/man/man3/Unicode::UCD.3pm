.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Unicode::UCD module offers a series of functions that
provide a simple interface to the Unicode
Character Database.
.SS "code point argument"
.IX Subsection "code point argument"
Some of the functions are called with a \fIcode point argument\fR, which is either
a decimal or a hexadecimal scalar designating a code point in the platform's
native character set (extended to Unicode), or a string containing \f(CW\*(C`U+\*(C'\fR
followed by hexadecimals
designating a Unicode code point.  A leading 0 will force a hexadecimal
interpretation, as will a hexadecimal digit that isn't a decimal digit.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    223     # Decimal 223 in native character set
\&    0223    # Hexadecimal 223, native (= 547 decimal)
\&    0xDF    # Hexadecimal DF, native (= 223 decimal)
\&    \*(Aq0xDF\*(Aq  # String form of hexadecimal (= 223 decimal)
\&    \*(AqU+DF\*(Aq  # Hexadecimal DF, in Unicode\*(Aqs character set
\&                              (= LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S)
.Ve
.PP
Note that the largest code point in Unicode is U+10FFFF.
.SS "\fBcharinfo()\fP"
.IX Subsection "charinfo()"
.Vb 1
\&    use Unicode::UCD \*(Aqcharinfo\*(Aq;
\&
\&    my $charinfo = charinfo(0x41);
.Ve
.PP
This returns information about the input \*(L"code point argument\*(R"
as a reference to a hash of fields as defined by the Unicode
standard.  If the \*(L"code point argument\*(R" is not assigned in the standard
(i.e., has the general category \f(CW\*(C`Cn\*(C'\fR meaning \f(CW\*(C`Unassigned\*(C'\fR)
or is a non-character (meaning it is guaranteed to never be assigned in
the standard),
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned.
.PP
Fields that aren't applicable to the particular code point argument exist in the
returned hash, and are empty.
.PP
For results that are less \*(L"raw\*(R" than this function returns, or to get the values for
any property, not just the few covered by this function, use the
\&\*(L"\fBcharprop()\fR\*(R" function.
.PP
The keys in the hash with the meanings of their values are:
.IP "\fBcode\fR" 4
.IX Item "code"
the input native \*(L"code point argument\*(R" expressed in hexadecimal, with
leading zeros
added if necessary to make it contain at least four hexdigits
.IP "\fBname\fR" 4
.IX Item "name"
name of \fIcode\fR, all \s-1IN UPPER CASE.\s0
Some control-type code points do not have names.
This field will be empty for \f(CW\*(C`Surrogate\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Private Use\*(C'\fR code points,
and for the others without a name,
it will contain a description enclosed in angle brackets, like
\&\f(CW\*(C`<control>\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBcategory\fR" 4
.IX Item "category"
The short name of the general category of \fIcode\fR.
This will match one of the keys in the hash returned by \*(L"\fBgeneral_categories()\fR\*(R".
.Sp
The \*(L"\fBprop_value_aliases()\fR\*(R" function can be used to get all the synonyms
of the category name.
.IP "\fBcombining\fR" 4
.IX Item "combining"
the combining class number for \fIcode\fR used in the Canonical Ordering Algorithm.
For Unicode 5.1, this is described in Section 3.11 \f(CW\*(C`Canonical Ordering Behavior\*(C'\fR
available at
<http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/>
.Sp
The \*(L"\fBprop_value_aliases()\fR\*(R" function can be used to get all the synonyms
of the combining class number.
.IP "\fBbidi\fR" 4
.IX Item "bidi"
bidirectional type of \fIcode\fR.
This will match one of the keys in the hash returned by \*(L"\fBbidi_types()\fR\*(R".
.Sp
The \*(L"\fBprop_value_aliases()\fR\*(R" function can be used to get all the synonyms
of the bidi type name.
.IP "\fBdecomposition\fR" 4
.IX Item "decomposition"
is empty if \fIcode\fR has no decomposition; or is one or more codes
(separated by spaces) that, taken in order, represent a decomposition for
\&\fIcode\fR.  Each has at least four hexdigits.
The codes may be preceded by a word enclosed in angle brackets, then a space,
like \f(CW\*(C`<compat> \*(C'\fR, giving the type of decomposition
.Sp
This decomposition may be an intermediate one whose components are also
decomposable.  Use Unicode::Normalize to get the final decomposition in one
step.
.IP "\fBdecimal\fR" 4
.IX Item "decimal"
if \fIcode\fR represents a decimal digit this is its integer numeric value
.IP "\fBdigit\fR" 4
.IX Item "digit"
if \fIcode\fR represents some other digit-like number, this is its integer
numeric value
.IP "\fBnumeric\fR" 4
.IX Item "numeric"
if \fIcode\fR represents a whole or rational number, this is its numeric value.
Rational values are expressed as a string like \f(CW\*(C`1/4\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBmirrored\fR" 4
.IX Item "mirrored"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Y\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR designating if \fIcode\fR is mirrored in bidirectional text
.IP "\fBunicode10\fR" 4
.IX Item "unicode10"
name of \fIcode\fR in the Unicode 1.0 standard if one
existed for this code point and is different from the current name
.IP "\fBcomment\fR" 4
.IX Item "comment"
As of Unicode 6.0, this is always empty.
.IP "\fBupper\fR" 4
.IX Item "upper"
is, if non-empty, the uppercase mapping for \fIcode\fR expressed as at least four
hexdigits.  This indicates that the full uppercase mapping is a single
character, and is identical to the simple (single-character only) mapping.
When this field is empty, it means that the simple uppercase mapping is
\&\fIcode\fR itself; you'll need some other means, (like \*(L"\fBcharprop()\fR\*(R" or
\&\*(L"\fBcasespec()\fR\*(R" to get the full mapping.
.IP "\fBlower\fR" 4
.IX Item "lower"
is, if non-empty, the lowercase mapping for \fIcode\fR expressed as at least four
hexdigits.  This indicates that the full lowercase mapping is a single
character, and is identical to the simple (single-character only) mapping.
When this field is empty, it means that the simple lowercase mapping is
\&\fIcode\fR itself; you'll need some other means, (like \*(L"\fBcharprop()\fR\*(R" or
\&\*(L"\fBcasespec()\fR\*(R" to get the full mapping.
.IP "\fBtitle\fR" 4
.IX Item "title"
is, if non-empty, the titlecase mapping for \fIcode\fR expressed as at least four
hexdigits.  This indicates that the full titlecase mapping is a single
character, and is identical to the simple (single-character only) mapping.
When this field is empty, it means that the simple titlecase mapping is
\&\fIcode\fR itself; you'll need some other means, (like \*(L"\fBcharprop()\fR\*(R" or
\&\*(L"\fBcasespec()\fR\*(R" to get the full mapping.
.IP "\fBblock\fR" 4
.IX Item "block"
the block \fIcode\fR belongs to (used in \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Blk=...}\*(C'\fR).
The \*(L"\fBprop_value_aliases()\fR\*(R" function can be used to get all the synonyms
of the block name.
.Sp
See \*(L"Blocks versus Scripts\*(R".
.IP "\fBscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "script"
the script \fIcode\fR belongs to.
The \*(L"\fBprop_value_aliases()\fR\*(R" function can be used to get all the synonyms
of the script name.  Note that this is the older \*(L"Script\*(R" property value, and
not the improved \*(L"Script_Extensions\*(R" value.
.Sp
See \*(L"Blocks versus Scripts\*(R".
.PP
Note that you cannot do (de)composition and casing based solely on the
\&\fIdecomposition\fR, \fIcombining\fR, \fIlower\fR, \fIupper\fR, and \fItitle\fR fields; you
will need also the \*(L"\fBcasespec()\fR\*(R" function and the \f(CW\*(C`Composition_Exclusion\*(C'\fR
property.  (Or you could just use the \fBlc()\fR,
\&\fBuc()\fR, and \fBucfirst()\fR functions, and the
Unicode::Normalize module.)
.SS "\fBcharprop()\fP"
.IX Subsection "charprop()"
.Vb 1
\&    use Unicode::UCD \*(Aqcharprop\*(Aq;
\&
\&    print charprop(0x41, "Gc"), "\en";
\&    print charprop(0x61, "General_Category"), "\en";
\&
\&  prints
\&    Lu
\&    Ll
.Ve
.PP
This returns the value of the Unicode property given by the second parameter
for the  \*(L"code point argument\*(R" given by the first.
.PP
The passed-in property may be specified as any of the synonyms returned by
\&\*(L"\fBprop_aliases()\fR\*(R".
.PP
The return value is always a scalar, either a string or a number.  For
properties where there are synonyms for the values, the synonym returned by
this function is the longest, most descriptive form, the one returned by
\&\*(L"\fBprop_value_aliases()\fR\*(R" when called in a scalar context.  Of course, you can
call \*(L"\fBprop_value_aliases()\fR\*(R" on the result to get other synonyms.
.PP
The return values are more \*(L"cooked\*(R" than the \*(L"\fBcharinfo()\fR\*(R" ones.  For
example, the \f(CW"uc"\fR property value is the actual string containing the full
uppercase mapping of the input code point.  You have to go to extra trouble
with \f(CW\*(C`charinfo\*(C'\fR to get this value from its \f(CW\*(C`upper\*(C'\fR hash element when the
full mapping differs from the simple one.
.PP
Special note should be made of the return values for a few properties:
.IP "Block" 4
.IX Item "Block"
The value returned is the new-style (see \*(L"Old-style versus new-style block
names\*(R").
.IP "Decomposition_Mapping" 4
.IX Item "Decomposition_Mapping"
Like \*(L"\fBcharinfo()\fR\*(R", the result may be an intermediate decomposition whose
components are also decomposable.  Use Unicode::Normalize to get the final
decomposition in one step.
.Sp
Unlike \*(L"\fBcharinfo()\fR\*(R", this does not include the decomposition type.  Use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Decomposition_Type\*(C'\fR property to get that.
.IP "Name_Alias" 4
.IX Item "Name_Alias"
If the input code point's name has more than one synonym, they are returned
joined into a single comma-separated string.
.IP "Numeric_Value" 4
.IX Item "Numeric_Value"
If the result is a fraction, it is converted into a floating point number to
the accuracy of your platform.
.IP "Script_Extensions" 4
.IX Item "Script_Extensions"
If the result is multiple script names, they are returned joined into a single
comma-separated string.
.PP
When called with a property that is a Perl extension that isn't expressible in
a compound form, this function currently returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, as the only two
possible values are \fItrue\fR or \fIfalse\fR (1 or 0 I suppose).  This behavior may
change in the future, so don't write code that relies on it.  \f(CW\*(C`Present_In\*(C'\fR is
a Perl extension that is expressible in a bipartite or compound form (for
example, \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Present_In=4.0}\*(C'\fR), so \f(CW\*(C`charprop\*(C'\fR accepts it.  But \f(CW\*(C`Any\*(C'\fR is a
Perl extension that isn't expressible that way, so \f(CW\*(C`charprop\*(C'\fR returns
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR for it.  Also \f(CW\*(C`charprop\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR for all Perl extensions
that are internal-only.
.SS "\fBcharprops_all()\fP"
.IX Subsection "charprops_all()"
.Vb 1
\&    use Unicode::UCD \*(Aqcharprops_all\*(Aq;
\&
\&    my $%properties_of_A_hash_ref = charprops_all("U+41");
.Ve
.PP
This returns a reference to a hash whose keys are all the distinct Unicode (no
Perl extension) properties, and whose values are the respective values for
those properties for the input \*(L"code point argument\*(R".
.PP
Each key is the property name in its longest, most descriptive form.  The
values are what \*(L"\fBcharprop()\fR\*(R" would return.
.PP
This function is expensive in time and memory.
.SS "\fBcharblock()\fP"
.IX Subsection "charblock()"
.Vb 1
\&    use Unicode::UCD \*(Aqcharblock\*(Aq;
\&
\&    my $charblock = charblock(0x41);
\&    my $charblock = charblock(1234);
\&    my $charblock = charblock(0x263a);
\&    my $charblock = charblock("U+263a");
\&
\&    my $range     = charblock(\*(AqArmenian\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
With a \*(L"code point argument\*(R" \f(CW\*(C`charblock()\*(C'\fR returns the \fIblock\fR the code point
belongs to, e.g.  \f(CW\*(C`Basic Latin\*(C'\fR.  The old-style block name is returned (see
\&\*(L"Old-style versus new-style block names\*(R").
The \*(L"\fBprop_value_aliases()\fR\*(R" function can be used to get all the synonyms
of the block name.
.PP
If the code point is unassigned, this returns the block it would belong to if
it were assigned.  (If the Unicode version being used is so early as to not
have blocks, all code points are considered to be in \f(CW\*(C`No_Block\*(C'\fR.)
.PP
See also \*(L"Blocks versus Scripts\*(R".
.PP
If supplied with an argument that can't be a code point, \f(CW\*(C`charblock()\*(C'\fR tries to
do the opposite and interpret the argument as an old-style block name.  On an
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 platform, the return value is a \fIrange set\fR with one range: an
anonymous array with a single element that consists of another anonymous array
whose first element is the first code point in the block, and whose second
element is the final code point in the block.  On an \s-1EBCDIC\s0
platform, the first two Unicode blocks are not contiguous.  Their range sets
are lists containing \fIstart-of-range\fR, \fIend-of-range\fR code point pairs.  You
can test whether a code point is in a range set using the \*(L"\fBcharinrange()\fR\*(R"
function.  (To be precise, each \fIrange set\fR contains a third array element,
after the range boundary ones: the old_style block name.)
.PP
If the argument to \f(CW\*(C`charblock()\*(C'\fR is not a known block, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is
returned.
.SS "\fBcharscript()\fP"

With a \*(L"code point argument\*(R", \f(CW\*(C`charscript()\*(C'\fR returns the \fIscript\fR the
code point belongs to, e.g., \f(CW\*(C`Latin\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Greek\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Han\*(C'\fR.
If the code point is unassigned or the Unicode version being used is so early

added if necessary to make it contain at least four hexdigits
.IP "\fBfull\fR" 4

one or more codes (separated by spaces) that, taken in order, give the
code points for the case folding for \fIcode\fR.
Each has at least four hexdigits.
.IP "\fBsimple\fR" 4
.IX Item "simple"
is empty, or is exactly one code with at least four hexdigits which can be used
as an alternative case folding when the calling program cannot cope with the
fold being a sequence of multiple code points.  If \fIfull\fR is just one code
point, then \fIsimple\fR equals \fIfull\fR.  If there is no single code point folding
defined for \fIcode\fR, then \fIsimple\fR is the empty string.  Otherwise, it is an
inferior, but still better-than-nothing alternative folding to \fIfull\fR.
.IP "\fBmapping\fR" 4
.IX Item "mapping"
is the same as \fIsimple\fR if \fIsimple\fR is not empty, and it is the same as \fIfull\fR
otherwise.  It can be considered to be the simplest possible folding for
\&\fIcode\fR.  It is defined primarily for backwards compatibility.
.IP "\fBstatus\fR" 4

folds, \fIsimple\fR and \fIfull\fR (\fImapping\fR equals \fIsimple\fR).  And it is \f(CW\*(C`F\*(C'\fR if
there is only a \fIfull\fR fold (\fImapping\fR equals \fIfull\fR; \fIsimple\fR is empty).

Each code has at least four hexdigits.
Note that this folding does not maintain canonical equivalence without
additional processing.

\&\fImapping\fR, \fIfull\fR, \fIsimple\fR, and \fIturkic\fR are all equal.
.PP
Programs that want complete generality and the best folding results should use
the folding contained in the \fIfull\fR field.  But note that the fold for some
code points will be a sequence of multiple code points.
.PP
Programs that can't cope with the fold mapping being multiple code points can
use the folding contained in the \fIsimple\fR field, with the loss of some
generality.  In Unicode 5.1, about 7% of the defined foldings have no single
code point folding.
.PP
The \fImapping\fR and \fIstatus\fR fields are provided for backwards compatibility for
existing programs.  They contain the same values as in previous versions of
this function.
.PP
Locale is not completely independent.  The \fIturkic\fR field contains results to
use when the locale is a Turkic language.

likewise for a lowercase \*(L"a\*(R", but there is an entry for a capital \*(L"A\*(R".  The

the conditions for the mappings to be valid.
If \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, the mappings are always valid.
When defined, this field is a list of conditions,
all of which must be true for the mappings to be valid.
The list consists of one or more

Case distinctions in the condition list are not significant.
Conditions preceded by \*(L"\s-1NON_\*(R"\s0 represent the negation of the condition.

For Unicode 5.1, they are defined in Section 3.13 \f(CW\*(C`Default Case Operations\*(C'\fR

These are for context-sensitive casing.
.PP
The hash described above is returned for locale-independent casing, where
at least one of the mappings has length longer than one.  If \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is
returned, the code point may have mappings, but if so, all are length one,

set of mappings for a code point, even those whose length is one.
.PP
If there are additional casing rules that apply only in certain locales,
an additional key for each will be defined in the returned hash.  Each such key
will be its locale name, defined as a 2\-letter \s-1ISO 3166\s0 country code, possibly
followed by a \*(L"_\*(R" and a 2\-letter \s-1ISO\s0 language code (possibly followed by a \*(L"_\*(R"
and a variant code).  You can find the lists of all possible locales, see
Locale::Country and Locale::Language.
(In Unicode 6.0, the only locales returned by this function
are \f(CW\*(C`lt\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`tr\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`az\*(C'\fR.)
.PP
Each locale key is a reference to a hash that has the form above, and gives
the casing rules for that particular locale, which take precedence over the
locale-independent ones when in that locale.
.PP
If the only casing for a code point is locale-dependent, then the returned
hash will not have any of the base keys, like \f(CW\*(C`code\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`upper\*(C'\fR, etc., but

digits, for example, are not in such a contiguous block, and so Unicode

match them.  A single-character string containing one of these digits will
have its decimal value returned by \f(CW\*(C`num\*(C'\fR, but any longer string containing
only these digits will return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.

Strings of multiple sub\- and superscripts are not recognized as numbers.  You
can use either of the compatibility decompositions in Unicode::Normalize to
change these into digits, and then call \f(CW\*(C`num\*(C'\fR on the result.

.PP
Most Unicode properties have several synonymous names.  Typically, there is at
least a short name, convenient to type, and a long name that more fully
describes the property, and hence is more easily understood.
.PP
If you know one name for a Unicode property, you can use \f(CW\*(C`prop_aliases\*(C'\fR to find
either the long name (when called in scalar context), or a list of all of the
names, somewhat ordered so that the short name is in the 0th element, the long
name in the next element, and any other synonyms are in the remaining
elements, in no particular order.
.PP
The long name is returned in a form nicely capitalized, suitable for printing.
.PP
The input parameter name is loosely matched, which means that white space,
hyphens, and underscores are ignored (except for the trailing underscore in
the old_form grandfathered-in \f(CW"L_"\fR, which is better written as \f(CW"LC"\fR, and
both of which mean \f(CW\*(C`General_Category=Cased Letter\*(C'\fR).
.PP
If the name is unknown, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned (or an empty list in list
context).  Note that Perl typically recognizes property names in regular
expressions with an optional \f(CW\*(C`"Is_\*(C'\fR" (with or without the underscore)
prefixed to them, such as \f(CW\*(C`\ep{isgc=punct}\*(C'\fR.  This function does not recognize
those in the input, returning \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.  Nor are they included in the output
as possible synonyms.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`prop_aliases\*(C'\fR does know about the Perl extensions to Unicode properties,
such as \f(CW\*(C`Any\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`XPosixAlpha\*(C'\fR, and the single form equivalents to Unicode
properties such as \f(CW\*(C`XDigit\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Greek\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`In_Greek\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`Is_Greek\*(C'\fR.  The
final example demonstrates that the \f(CW"Is_"\fR prefix is recognized for these
extensions; it is needed to resolve ambiguities.  For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`prop_aliases(\*(Aqlc\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR returns the list \f(CW\*(C`(lc, Lowercase_Mapping)\*(C'\fR, but
\&\f(CW\*(C`prop_aliases(\*(Aqislc\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`(Is_LC, Cased_Letter)\*(C'\fR.  This is
because \f(CW\*(C`islc\*(C'\fR is a Perl extension which is short for
\&\f(CW\*(C`General_Category=Cased Letter\*(C'\fR.  The lists returned for the Perl extensions
will not include the \f(CW"Is_"\fR prefix (whether or not the input had it) unless
needed to resolve ambiguities, as shown in the \f(CW"islc"\fR example, where the
returned list had one element containing \f(CW"Is_"\fR, and the other without.
.PP
It is also possible for the reverse to happen:  \f(CW\*(C`prop_aliases(\*(Aqisc\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR returns
the list \f(CW\*(C`(isc, ISO_Comment)\*(C'\fR; whereas \f(CW\*(C`prop_aliases(\*(Aqc\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR returns
\&\f(CW\*(C`(C, Other)\*(C'\fR (the latter being a Perl extension meaning
\&\f(CW\*(C`General_Category=Other\*(C'\fR.
\&\*(L"Properties accessible through Unicode::UCD\*(R" in perluniprops lists the available
forms, including which ones are discouraged from use.
.PP
Those discouraged forms are accepted as input to \f(CW\*(C`prop_aliases\*(C'\fR, but are not
returned in the lists.  \f(CW\*(C`prop_aliases(\*(AqisL&\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`prop_aliases(\*(AqisL_\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR,
which are old synonyms for \f(CW"Is_LC"\fR and should not be used in new code, are
examples of this.  These both return \f(CW\*(C`(Is_LC, Cased_Letter)\*(C'\fR.  Thus this
function allows you to take a discouraged form, and find its acceptable
alternatives.  The same goes with single-form Block property equivalences.
Only the forms that begin with \f(CW"In_"\fR are not discouraged; if you pass
\&\f(CW\*(C`prop_aliases\*(C'\fR a discouraged form, you will get back the equivalent ones that
begin with \f(CW"In_"\fR.  It will otherwise look like a new-style block name (see.

Inversion lists are a compact way of specifying Unicode property-value
definitions.  The 0th item in the list is the lowest code point that has the
property-value.  The next item (item [1]) is the lowest code point beyond that
one that does \s-1NOT\s0 have the property-value.  And the next item beyond that
([2]) is the lowest code point beyond that one that does have the
property-value, and so on.  Put another way, each element in the list gives
the beginning of a range that has the property-value (for even numbered
elements), or doesn't have the property-value (for odd numbered elements).
The name for this data structure stems from the fact that each element in the
list toggles (or inverts) whether the corresponding range is or isn't on the
list.
.PP
In the final example above, the first \s-1ASCII\s0 Hex digit is code point 48, the
character \*(L"0\*(R", and all code points from it through 57 (a \*(L"9\*(R") are \s-1ASCII\s0 hex
digits.  Code points 58 through 64 aren't, but 65 (an \*(L"A\*(R") through 70 (an \*(L"F\*(R")
are, as are 97 (\*(L"a\*(R") through 102 (\*(L"f\*(R").  103 starts a range of code points
that aren't \s-1ASCII\s0 hex digits.  That range extends to infinity, which on your
computer can be found in the variable \f(CW$Unicode::UCD::MAX_CP\fR.  (This
variable is as close to infinity as Perl can get on your platform, and may be
too high for some operations to work; you may wish to use a smaller number for
your purposes.)
.PP
Note that the inversion lists returned by this function can possibly include
non-Unicode code points, that is anything above 0x10FFFF.  Unicode properties
are not defined on such code points.  You might wish to change the output to
not include these.  Simply add 0x110000 at the end of the non-empty returned
list if it isn't already that value; and pop that value if it is; like:
.PP
.Vb 9
\& my @list = prop_invlist("foo");
\& if (@list) {
\&     if ($list[\-1] == 0x110000) {
\&         pop @list;  # Defeat the turning on for above Unicode

\&\f(CW\*(C`prop_invmap\*(C'\fR is used to get the complete mapping definition for a property,
in the form of an inversion map.  An inversion map consists of two parallel
arrays.  One is an ordered list of code points that mark range beginnings, and
the other gives the value (or mapping) that all code points in the
corresponding range have.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`prop_invmap\*(C'\fR is called with the name of the desired property.  The name is
loosely matched, meaning that differences in case, white-space, hyphens, and
underscores are not meaningful (except for the trailing underscore in the
old-form grandfathered-in property \f(CW"L_"\fR, which is better written as \f(CW"LC"\fR,
or even better, \f(CW"Gc=LC"\fR).
.PP
Many Unicode properties have more than one name (or alias).  \f(CW\*(C`prop_invmap\*(C'\fR
understands all of these, including Perl extensions to them.  Ambiguities are
resolved as described above for \*(L"\fBprop_aliases()\fR\*(R" (except if a property has
both a complete mapping, and a binary \f(CW\*(C`Y\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR mapping, then specifying the
property name prefixed by \f(CW"is"\fR causes the binary one to be returned).  The
Perl internal property "Perl_Decimal_Digit, described below, is also accepted.
An empty list is returned if the property name is unknown.
See \*(L"Properties accessible through Unicode::UCD\*(R" in perluniprops for the
properties acceptable as inputs to this function.

It is a fatal error to call this function except in list context.
.PP
In addition to the two arrays that form the inversion map, \f(CW\*(C`prop_invmap\*(C'\fR
returns two other values; one is a scalar that gives some details as to the
format of the entries of the map array; the other is a default value, useful
in maps whose format name begins with the letter \f(CW"a"\fR, as described

means that the value from the first line, \*(L"Basic Latin\*(R", extends to all code
points in the range from 0 up to but not including 0x0080, that is, through
127.  In other words, the code points from 0 to 127 are all in the \*(L"Basic

not including) 0x0100 are in the block named \*(L"Latin\-1 Supplement\*(R", etc.

The final line (with Index [242]) means that the value for all code points above
the legal Unicode maximum code point have the value \*(L"No_Block\*(R", which is the
term Unicode uses for a non-existing block.
.PP
The arrays completely specify the mappings for all possible code points.
The final element in an inversion map returned by this function will always be
for the range that consists of all the code points that aren't legal Unicode,
but that are expressible on the platform.  (That is, it starts with code point
0x110000, the first code point above the legal Unicode maximum, and extends to
infinity.) The value for that range will be the same that any typical
unassigned code point has for the specified property.  (Certain unassigned
code points are not \*(L"typical\*(R"; for example the non-character code points, or
those in blocks that are to be written right-to-left.  The above-Unicode
range's value is not based on these atypical code points.)  It could be argued
that, instead of treating these as unassigned Unicode code points, the value
for this range should be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.  If you wish, you can change the returned
arrays accordingly.
.PP
The maps for almost all properties are simple scalars that should be
interpreted as-is.
These values are those given in the Unicode-supplied data files, which may be
inconsistent as to capitalization and as to which synonym for a property-value
is given.  The results may be normalized by using the \*(L"\fBprop_value_aliases()\fR\*(R"
function.
.PP
There are exceptions to the simple scalar maps.  Some properties have some
elements in their map list that are themselves lists of scalars; and some
special strings are returned that are not to be interpreted as-is.  Element
[2] (placed into \f(CW$format\fR in the example above) of the returned four element
list tells you if the map has any of these special elements or not, as follows:
.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""s""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBs\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "s"
means all the elements of the map array are simple scalars, with no special
elements.  Almost all properties are like this, like the \f(CW\*(C`block\*(C'\fR example
above.
.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""sl""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBsl\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "sl"
means that some of the map array elements have the form given by \f(CW"s"\fR, and
the rest are lists of scalars.  For example, here is a portion of the output
of calling \f(CW\*(C`prop_invmap\*(C'\fR() with the \*(L"Script Extensions\*(R" property:
.Sp

is like \f(CW"s"\fR in that all the map array elements are scalars, but here they are
restricted to all being integers, and some have to be adjusted (hence the name
\&\f(CW"a"\fR) to get the correct result.  For example, in:
.Sp
.Vb 2

and \f(CW$default\fR is 0.
.Sp
Let's start with the second line.  It says that the uppercase of code point 97
is 65; or \f(CW\*(C`uc("a")\*(C'\fR == \*(L"A\*(R".  But the line is for the entire range of code
points 97 through 122.  To get the mapping for any code point in this range,
you take the offset it has from the beginning code point of the range, and add
that to the mapping for that first code point.  So, the mapping for 122 (\*(L"z\*(R")
is derived by taking the offset of 122 from 97 (=25) and adding that to 65,
yielding 90 (\*(L"z\*(R").  Likewise for everything in between.
.Sp
Requiring this simple adjustment allows the returned arrays to be
significantly smaller than otherwise, up to a factor of 10, speeding up
searching through them.
.Sp
Ranges that map to \f(CW$default\fR, \f(CW"0"\fR, behave somewhat differently.  For
these, each code point maps to itself.  So, in the first line in the example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`ord(uc(chr(0)))\*(C'\fR is 0, \f(CW\*(C`ord(uc(chr(1)))\*(C'\fR is 1, ..
\&\f(CW\*(C`ord(uc(chr(96)))\*(C'\fR is 96.
.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""al""\fB\fR" 4

.IX Item "al"
means that some of the map array elements have the form given by \f(CW"a"\fR, and
the rest are ordered lists of code points.
For example, in:
.Sp
.Vb 2

\&                                 = prop_invmap("Uppercase_Mapping");

.Ve
.Sp
This is the full Uppercase_Mapping property (as opposed to the
Simple_Uppercase_Mapping given in the example for format \f(CW"a"\fR).  The only
difference between the two in the ranges shown is that the code point at
0x0149 (\s-1LATIN SMALL LETTER N PRECEDED BY APOSTROPHE\s0) maps to a string of two
characters, 0x02BC (\s-1MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE\s0) followed by 0x004E (\s-1LATIN
CAPITAL LETTER N\s0).
.Sp
No adjustments are needed to entries that are references to arrays; each such
entry will have exactly one element in its range, so the offset is always 0.
.Sp
The fourth (index [3]) element (\f(CW$default\fR) in the list returned for this
format is 0.
.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""ae""\fB\fR" 4

.IX Item "ae"
This is like \f(CW"a"\fR, but some elements are the empty string, and should not be
adjusted.
The one internal Perl property accessible by \f(CW\*(C`prop_invmap\*(C'\fR is of this type:
\&\*(L"Perl_Decimal_Digit\*(R" returns an inversion map which gives the numeric values
that are represented by the Unicode decimal digit characters.  Characters that
don't represent decimal digits map to the empty string, like so:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\& @digits    @values
\& 0x0000       ""
\& 0x0030        0
\& 0x003A:      ""

\& 0x07CA:      ""
\& 0x0966:       0
\& ...
.Ve
.Sp
This means that the code points from 0 to 0x2F do not represent decimal digits;
the code point 0x30 (\s-1DIGIT ZERO\s0) represents 0;  code point 0x31, (\s-1DIGIT ONE\s0),
represents 0+1\-0 = 1; ... code point 0x39, (\s-1DIGIT NINE\s0), represents 0+9\-0 = 9;
\&... code points 0x3A through 0x65F do not represent decimal digits; 0x660

.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""ale""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBale\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "ale"
is a combination of the \f(CW"al"\fR type and the \f(CW"ae"\fR type.  Some of
the map array elements have the forms given by \f(CW"al"\fR, and
the rest are the empty string.  The property \f(CW\*(C`NFKC_Casefold\*(C'\fR has this form.
An example slice is:

format is 0.
.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""ar""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBar\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "ar"
means that all the elements of the map array are either rational numbers or
the string \f(CW"NaN"\fR, meaning \*(L"Not a Number\*(R".  A rational number is either an
integer, or two integers separated by a solidus (\f(CW"/"\fR).  The second integer
represents the denominator of the division implied by the solidus, and is
actually always positive, so it is guaranteed not to be 0 and to not be
signed.  When the element is a plain integer (without the
solidus), it may need to be adjusted to get the correct value by adding the
offset, just as other \f(CW"a"\fR properties.  No adjustment is needed for
fractions, as the range is guaranteed to have just a single element, and so
the offset is always 0.
.Sp
If you want to convert the returned map to entirely scalar numbers, you
can use something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& my ($invlist_ref, $invmap_ref, $format) = prop_invmap($property);
\& if ($format && $format eq "ar") {
\&     map { $_ = eval $_ if $_ ne \*(AqNaN\*(Aq } @$map_ref;

.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""n""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBn\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
means the Name property.  All the elements of the map array are simple
scalars, but some of them contain special strings that require more work to
get the actual name.
.Sp
Entries such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH\-<code point>
.Ve
.Sp
mean that the name for the code point is \*(L"\s-1CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH\-\*(R"\s0
with the code point (expressed in hexadecimal) appended to it, like \*(L"\s-1CJK
UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH\-3403\*(R"\s0 (similarly for \f(CW\*(C`CJK\ COMPATIBILITY\ IDEOGRAPH\-<code\ point>\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
Also, entries like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& <hangul syllable>
.Ve
.Sp
means that the name is algorithmically calculated.  This is easily done by
the function \*(L"charnames::viacode(code)\*(R" in charnames.
.Sp
Note that for control characters (\f(CW\*(C`Gc=cc\*(C'\fR), Unicode's data files have the
string "\f(CW\*(C`<control>\*(C'\fR", but the real name of each of these characters is the empty
string.  This function returns that real name, the empty string.  (There are
names for these characters, but they are considered aliases, not the Name
property name, and are contained in the \f(CW\*(C`Name_Alias\*(C'\fR property.)
.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""ad""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBad\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "ad"
means the Decomposition_Mapping property.  This property is like \f(CW"al"\fR
properties, except that one of the scalar elements is of the form:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& <hangul syllable>
.Ve
.Sp
This signifies that this entry should be replaced by the decompositions for
all the code points whose decomposition is algorithmically calculated.  (All
of them are currently in one range and no others outside the range are likely
to ever be added to Unicode; the \f(CW"n"\fR format
has this same entry.)  These can be generated via the function
\&\fBUnicode::Normalize::NFD()\fR.
.Sp
Note that the mapping is the one that is specified in the Unicode data files,
and to get the final decomposition, it may need to be applied recursively.
Unicode in fact discourages use of this property except internally in
implementations of the Unicode Normalization Algorithm.
.Sp
The fourth (index [3]) element (\f(CW$default\fR) in the list returned for this
format is 0.
.PP
Note that a format begins with the letter \*(L"a\*(R" if and only the property it is
for requires adjustments by adding the offsets in multi-element ranges.  For
all these properties, an entry should be adjusted only if the map is a scalar
which is an integer.  That is, it must match the regular expression:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    / ^ \-? \ed+ $ /xa
.Ve
.PP
Further, the first element in a range never needs adjustment, as the
adjustment would be just adding 0.
.PP
A binary search such as that provided by \*(L"\fBsearch_invlist()\fR\*(R", can be used to
quickly find a code point in the inversion list, and hence its corresponding
mapping.
.PP
The final, fourth element (index [3], assigned to \f(CW$default\fR in the \*(L"block\*(R"
example) in the four element list returned by this function is used with the
\&\f(CW"a"\fR format types; it may also be useful for applications
that wish to convert the returned inversion map data structure into some
other, such as a hash.  It gives the mapping that most code points map to
under the property.  If you establish the convention that any code point not
explicitly listed in your data structure maps to this value, you can
potentially make your data structure much smaller.  As you construct your data
structure from the one returned by this function, simply ignore those ranges
that map to this value.  For example, to
convert to the data structure searchable by \*(L"\fBcharinrange()\fR\*(R", you can follow
this recipe for properties that don't require adjustments:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& my ($list_ref, $map_ref, $format, $default) = prop_invmap($property);
\& my @range_list;
\&
\& # Look at each element in the list, but the \-2 is needed because we
\& # look at $i+1 in the loop, and the final element is guaranteed to map
\& # to $default by prop_invmap(), so we would skip it anyway.
\& for my $i (0 .. @$list_ref \- 2) {
\&    next if $map_ref\->[$i] eq $default;
\&    push @range_list, [ $list_ref\->[$i],
\&                        $list_ref\->[$i+1],
\&                        $map_ref\->[$i]
\&                      ];
\& }
\&
\& print charinrange(\e@range_list, $code_point), "\en";
.Ve
.PP
With this, \f(CW\*(C`charinrange()\*(C'\fR will return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if its input code point maps
to \f(CW$default\fR.  You can avoid this by omitting the \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR statement, and adding
a line after the loop to handle the final element of the inversion map.
.PP
Similarly, this recipe can be used for properties that do require adjustments:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& for my $i (0 .. @$list_ref \- 2) {
\&    next if $map_ref\->[$i] eq $default;
\&

.IX Subsection "Blocks versus Scripts"
The difference between a block and a script is that scripts are closer
to the linguistic notion of a set of code points required to represent
languages, while block is more of an artifact of the Unicode code point
numbering and separation into blocks of consecutive code points (so far the
size of a block is some multiple of 16, like 128 or 256).
.PP
For example the Latin \fBscript\fR is spread over several \fBblocks\fR, such
as \f(CW\*(C`Basic Latin\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Latin 1 Supplement\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Latin Extended\-A\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`Latin Extended\-B\*(C'\fR.  On the other hand, the Latin script does not
contain all the characters of the \f(CW\*(C`Basic Latin\*(C'\fR block (also known as
\&\s-1ASCII\s0): it includes only the letters, and not, for example, the digits
nor the punctuation.

.SS "\fBMatching Scripts and Blocks\fP"
.IX Subsection "Matching Scripts and Blocks"
Scripts are matched with the regular-expression construct
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{...}\*(C'\fR (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Tibetan}\*(C'\fR matches characters of the Tibetan script),
while \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Blk=...}\*(C'\fR is used for blocks (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Blk=Tibetan}\*(C'\fR matches
any of the 256 code points in the Tibetan block).
.SS "Old-style versus new-style block names"
.IX Subsection "Old-style versus new-style block names"
Unicode publishes the names of blocks in two different styles, though the two
are equivalent under Unicode's loose matching rules.
.PP
The original style uses blanks and hyphens in the block names (except for
\&\f(CW\*(C`No_Block\*(C'\fR), like so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols\-B
.Ve
.PP
The newer style replaces these with underscores, like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Miscellaneous_Mathematical_Symbols_B
.Ve
.PP
This newer style is consistent with the values of other Unicode properties.
To preserve backward compatibility, all the functions in Unicode::UCD that
return block names (except as noted) return the old-style ones.
\&\*(L"\fBprop_value_aliases()\fR\*(R" returns the new-style and can be used to convert from
old-style to new-style:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& my $new_style = prop_values_aliases("block", $old_style);
.Ve
.PP
Perl also has single-form extensions that refer to blocks, \f(CW\*(C`In_Cyrillic\*(C'\fR,
meaning \f(CW\*(C`Block=Cyrillic\*(C'\fR.  These have always been written in the new style.
.PP
To convert from new-style to old-style, follow this recipe:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $old_style = charblock((prop_invlist("block=$new_style"))[0]);
.Ve
.PP
(which finds the range of code points in the block using \f(CW\*(C`prop_invlist\*(C'\fR,
gets the lower end of the range (0th element) and then looks up the old name
for its block using \f(CW\*(C`charblock\*(C'\fR).
.PP
Note that starting in Unicode 6.1, many of the block names have shorter
synonyms.  These are always given in the new style.
.SS "Use with older Unicode versions"
.IX Subsection "Use with older Unicode versions"
The functions in this module work as well as can be expected when
used on earlier Unicode versions.  But, obviously, they use the available data
from that Unicode version.  For example, if the Unicode version predates the
definition of the script property (Unicode 3.1), then any function that deals
with scripts is going to return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR for the script portion of the return
value.

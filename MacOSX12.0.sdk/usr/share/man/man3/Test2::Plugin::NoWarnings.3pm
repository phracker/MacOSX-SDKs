.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Loading this plugin causes your tests to fail if there any warnings while they
run. Each warning generates a new failing test and the warning content is
outputted via \f(CW\*(C`diag\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This module uses \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR, so if the code you're testing sets this,
then this module will stop working.
.SH "ECHOING WARNINGS"
.IX Header "ECHOING WARNINGS"
By default, this module suppresses the warning itself so it does not go to
\&\f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR. If you'd like to also have the warning go to \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR untouched,
you can ask for this with the \f(CW\*(C`echo\*(C'\fR import argument:
.PP
.Vb 1

I am also usually active on \s-1IRC\s0 as 'autarch' on \f(CW\*(C`irc://irc.perl.org\*(C'\fR.

.IX Header "DONATIONS"
If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a \*(L"donation\*(R" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.
.PP
Please note that \fBI am not suggesting that you must do this\fR in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.
.PP
Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time (let's all have a chuckle at that together).
.PP
To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org, or use the
button at <https://www.urth.org/fs\-donation.html>.

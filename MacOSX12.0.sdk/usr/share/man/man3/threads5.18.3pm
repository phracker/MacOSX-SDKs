.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Since Perl 5.8, thread programming has been available using a model called
\&\fIinterpreter threads\fR which provides a new Perl interpreter for each
thread, and, by default, results in no data or state information being shared
between threads.
.PP
(Prior to Perl 5.8, \fI5005threads\fR was available through the \f(CW\*(C`Thread.pm\*(C'\fR \s-1API.\s0
This threading model has been deprecated, and was removed as of Perl 5.10.0.)
.PP
As just mentioned, all variables are, by default, thread local.  To use shared
variables, you need to also load threads::shared:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use threads;
\&    use threads::shared;
.Ve
.PP
When loading threads::shared, you must \f(CW\*(C`use threads\*(C'\fR before you
\&\f(CW\*(C`use threads::shared\*(C'\fR.  (\f(CW\*(C`threads\*(C'\fR will emit a warning if you do it the
other way around.)
.PP
It is strongly recommended that you enable threads via \f(CW\*(C`use threads\*(C'\fR as early
as possible in your script.
.PP
If needed, scripts can be written so as to run on both threaded and
non-threaded Perls:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    my $can_use_threads = eval \*(Aquse threads; 1\*(Aq;
\&    if ($can_use_threads) {
\&        # Do processing using threads
\&        ...
\&    } else {
\&        # Do it without using threads
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.ie n .IP "$thr = threads\->create(\s-1FUNCTION, ARGS\s0)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$thr\fR = threads\->create(\s-1FUNCTION, ARGS\s0)" 4
.IX Item "$thr = threads->create(FUNCTION, ARGS)"
This will create a new thread that will begin execution with the specified
entry point function, and give it the \fI\s-1ARGS\s0\fR list as parameters.  It will
return the corresponding threads object, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if thread creation failed.
.Sp
\&\fI\s-1FUNCTION\s0\fR may either be the name of a function, an anonymous subroutine, or
a code ref.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    my $thr = threads\->create(\*(Aqfunc_name\*(Aq, ...);
\&        # or
\&    my $thr = threads\->create(sub { ... }, ...);
\&        # or
\&    my $thr = threads\->create(\e&func, ...);
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\->new()\*(C'\fR method is an alias for \f(CW\*(C`\->create()\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP "$thr\->\fIjoin()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$thr\fR\->\fIjoin()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->join()"
This will wait for the corresponding thread to complete its execution.  When
the thread finishes, \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR will return the return value(s) of the
entry point function.
.Sp
The context (void, scalar or list) for the return value(s) for \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR
is determined at the time of thread creation.
.Sp
.Vb 10

If the program exits without all threads having either been joined or
detached, then a warning will be issued.
.Sp
Calling \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\->detach()\*(C'\fR on an already joined thread will
cause an error to be thrown.
.ie n .IP "$thr\->\fIdetach()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$thr\fR\->\fIdetach()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->detach()"
Makes the thread unjoinable, and causes any eventual return value to be
discarded.  When the program exits, any detached threads that are still
running are silently terminated.
.Sp
If the program exits without all threads having either been joined or
detached, then a warning will be issued.
.Sp
Calling \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\->detach()\*(C'\fR on an already detached thread
will cause an error to be thrown.
.IP "threads\->\fIdetach()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->detach()"
Class method that allows a thread to detach itself.
.IP "threads\->\fIself()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->self()"
Class method that allows a thread to obtain its own \fIthreads\fR object.
.ie n .IP "$thr\->\fItid()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$thr\fR\->\fItid()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->tid()"
Returns the \s-1ID\s0 of the thread.  Thread IDs are unique integers with the main
thread in a program being 0, and incrementing by 1 for every thread created.
.IP "threads\->\fItid()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->tid()"
Class method that allows a thread to obtain its own \s-1ID.\s0
.ie n .IP """$thr""" 4
.el .IP "``$thr''" 4
.IX Item "$thr"
If you add the \f(CW\*(C`stringify\*(C'\fR import option to your \f(CW\*(C`use threads\*(C'\fR declaration,
then using a threads object in a string or a string context (e.g., as a hash
key) will cause its \s-1ID\s0 to be used as the value:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use threads qw(stringify);
\&
\&    my $thr = threads\->create(...);
\&    print("Thread $thr started...\en");  # Prints out: Thread 1 started...
.Ve
.IP "threads\->object($tid)" 4
.IX Item "threads->object($tid)"
This will return the \fIthreads\fR object for the \fIactive\fR thread associated
with the specified thread \s-1ID. \s0 If \f(CW$tid\fR is the value for the current thread,
then this call works the same as \f(CW\*(C`\->self()\*(C'\fR.  Otherwise, returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR
if there is no thread associated with the \s-1TID,\s0 if the thread is joined or
detached, if no \s-1TID\s0 is specified or if the specified \s-1TID\s0 is undef.
.IP "threads\->\fIyield()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->yield()"
This is a suggestion to the \s-1OS\s0 to let this thread yield \s-1CPU\s0 time to other
threads.  What actually happens is highly dependent upon the underlying
thread implementation.
.Sp
You may do \f(CW\*(C`use threads qw(yield)\*(C'\fR, and then just use \f(CW\*(C`yield()\*(C'\fR in your
code.
.IP "threads\->\fIlist()\fR" 4

.PD
With no arguments (or using \f(CW\*(C`threads::all\*(C'\fR) and in a list context, returns a
list of all non-joined, non-detached \fIthreads\fR objects.  In a scalar context,
returns a count of the same.
.Sp
With a \fItrue\fR argument (using \f(CW\*(C`threads::running\*(C'\fR), returns a list of all
non-joined, non-detached \fIthreads\fR objects that are still running.
.Sp
With a \fIfalse\fR argument (using \f(CW\*(C`threads::joinable\*(C'\fR), returns a list of all
non-joined, non-detached \fIthreads\fR objects that have finished running (i.e.,
for which \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR will not \fIblock\fR).
.ie n .IP "$thr1\->equal($thr2)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$thr1\fR\->equal($thr2)" 4
.IX Item "$thr1->equal($thr2)"
Tests if two threads objects are the same thread or not.  This is overloaded
to the more natural forms:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    if ($thr1 == $thr2) {
\&        print("Threads are the same\en");
\&    }
\&    # or
\&    if ($thr1 != $thr2) {
\&        print("Threads differ\en");
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
(Thread comparison is based on thread IDs.)
.IP "async \s-1BLOCK\s0;" 4
.IX Item "async BLOCK;"
\&\f(CW\*(C`async\*(C'\fR creates a thread to execute the block immediately following
it.  This block is treated as an anonymous subroutine, and so must have a
semicolon after the closing brace.  Like \f(CW\*(C`threads\->create()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`async\*(C'\fR
returns a \fIthreads\fR object.
.ie n .IP "$thr\->\fIerror()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$thr\fR\->\fIerror()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->error()"
Threads are executed in an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR context.  This method will return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR
if the thread terminates \fInormally\fR.  Otherwise, it returns the value of
\&\f(CW$@\fR associated with the thread's execution status in its \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR context.
.ie n .IP "$thr\->\fI_handle()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$thr\fR\->\fI_handle()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->_handle()"
This \fIprivate\fR method returns the memory location of the internal thread
structure associated with a threads object.  For Win32, this is a pointer to
the \f(CW\*(C`HANDLE\*(C'\fR value returned by \f(CW\*(C`CreateThread\*(C'\fR (i.e., \f(CW\*(C`HANDLE *\*(C'\fR); for other
platforms, it is a pointer to the \f(CW\*(C`pthread_t\*(C'\fR structure used in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`pthread_create\*(C'\fR call (i.e., \f(CW\*(C`pthread_t *\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
This method is of no use for general Perl threads programming.  Its intent is
to provide other (XS-based) thread modules with the capability to access, and
possibly manipulate, the underlying thread structure associated with a Perl
thread.
.IP "threads\->\fI_handle()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->_handle()"
Class method that allows a thread to obtain its own \fIhandle\fR.
.SH "EXITING A THREAD"
.IX Header "EXITING A THREAD"
The usual method for terminating a thread is to
\&\fIreturn()\fR from the entry point function with the
appropriate return value(s).
.IP "threads\->\fIexit()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->exit()"
If needed, a thread can be exited at any time by calling
\&\f(CW\*(C`threads\->exit()\*(C'\fR.  This will cause the thread to return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR in a
scalar context, or the empty list in a list context.
.Sp
When called from the \fImain\fR thread, this behaves the same as \f(CWexit(0)\fR.
.IP "threads\->exit(status)" 4
.IX Item "threads->exit(status)"
When called from a thread, this behaves like \f(CW\*(C`threads\->exit()\*(C'\fR (i.e., the
exit status code is ignored).
.Sp
When called from the \fImain\fR thread, this behaves the same as \f(CW\*(C`exit(status)\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fIdie()\fR" 4
.IX Item "die()"
Calling \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR in a thread indicates an abnormal exit for the thread.  Any
\&\f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR handler in the thread will be called first, and then the
thread will exit with a warning message that will contain any arguments passed
in the \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR call.
.IP "exit(status)" 4
.IX Item "exit(status)"
Calling \fIexit()\fR inside a thread causes the whole
application to terminate.  Because of this, the use of \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR inside
threaded code, or in modules that might be used in threaded applications, is
strongly discouraged.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR really is needed, then consider using the following:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    threads\->exit() if threads\->can(\*(Aqexit\*(Aq);   # Thread friendly
\&    exit(status);
.Ve
.IP "use threads 'exit' => 'threads_only'" 4
.IX Item "use threads 'exit' => 'threads_only'"
This globally overrides the default behavior of calling \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR inside a
thread, and effectively causes such calls to behave the same as
\&\f(CW\*(C`threads\->exit()\*(C'\fR.  In other words, with this setting, calling \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR
causes only the thread to terminate.
.Sp
Because of its global effect, this setting should not be used inside modules

Class method that allows a thread to determine whether or not it is detached.
.SH "THREAD CONTEXT"
.IX Header "THREAD CONTEXT"
As with subroutines, the type of value returned from a thread's entry point
function may be determined by the thread's \fIcontext\fR:  list, scalar or void.
The thread's context is determined at thread creation.  This is necessary so
that the context is available to the entry point function via
\&\fIwantarray()\fR.  The thread may then specify a value of
the appropriate type to be returned from \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Explicit context"
.IX Subsection "Explicit context"
Because thread creation and thread joining may occur in different contexts, it
may be desirable to state the context explicitly to the thread's entry point
function.  This may be done by calling \f(CW\*(C`\->create()\*(C'\fR with a hash reference
as the first argument:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $thr = threads\->create({\*(Aqcontext\*(Aq => \*(Aqlist\*(Aq}, \e&foo);
\&    ...
\&    my @results = $thr\->join();
.Ve
.PP
In the above, the threads object is returned to the parent thread in scalar
context, and the thread's entry point function \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR will be called in list
(array) context such that the parent thread can receive a list (array) from
the \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR call.  (\f(CW\*(Aqarray\*(Aq\fR is synonymous with \f(CW\*(Aqlist\*(Aq\fR.)
.PP
Similarly, if you need the threads object, but your thread will not be
returning a value (i.e., \fIvoid\fR context), you would do the following:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $thr = threads\->create({\*(Aqcontext\*(Aq => \*(Aqvoid\*(Aq}, \e&foo);
\&    ...
\&    $thr\->join();
.Ve
.PP
The context type may also be used as the \fIkey\fR in the hash reference followed
by a \fItrue\fR value:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    threads\->create({\*(Aqscalar\*(Aq => 1}, \e&foo);
\&    ...
\&    my ($thr) = threads\->list();
\&    my $result = $thr\->join();
.Ve
.SS "Implicit context"
.IX Subsection "Implicit context"
If not explicitly stated, the thread's context is implied from the context
of the \f(CW\*(C`\->create()\*(C'\fR call:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # Create thread in list context
\&    my ($thr) = threads\->create(...);
\&
\&    # Create thread in scalar context
\&    my $thr = threads\->create(...);
\&
\&    # Create thread in void context
\&    threads\->create(...);
.Ve
.ie n .SS "$thr\->\fIwantarray()\fP"
.el .SS "\f(CW$thr\fP\->\fIwantarray()\fP"
.IX Subsection "$thr->wantarray()"
This returns the thread's context in the same manner as
\&\fIwantarray()\fR.
.SS "threads\->\fIwantarray()\fP"
.IX Subsection "threads->wantarray()"
Class method to return the current thread's context.  This returns the same
value as running \fIwantarray()\fR inside the current
thread's entry point function.
.SH "THREAD STACK SIZE"
.IX Header "THREAD STACK SIZE"
The default per-thread stack size for different platforms varies
significantly, and is almost always far more than is needed for most
applications.  On Win32, Perl's makefile explicitly sets the default stack to
16 \s-1MB\s0; on most other platforms, the system default is used, which again may be
much larger than is needed.
.PP
By tuning the stack size to more accurately reflect your application's needs,
you may significantly reduce your application's memory usage, and increase the
number of simultaneously running threads.
.PP
Note that on Windows, address space allocation granularity is 64 \s-1KB,\s0
therefore, setting the stack smaller than that on Win32 Perl will not save any
more memory.
.IP "threads\->\fIget_stack_size()\fR;" 4
.IX Item "threads->get_stack_size();"
Returns the current default per-thread stack size.  The default is zero, which

.el .IP "\f(CW$size\fR = \f(CW$thr\fR\->\fIget_stack_size()\fR;" 4
.IX Item "$size = $thr->get_stack_size();"
Returns the stack size for a particular thread.  A return value of zero

.el .IP "\f(CW$old_size\fR = threads\->set_stack_size($new_size);" 4
.IX Item "$old_size = threads->set_stack_size($new_size);"
Sets a new default per-thread stack size, and returns the previous setting.
.Sp
Some platforms have a minimum thread stack size.  Trying to set the stack size
below this value will result in a warning, and the minimum stack size will be
used.
.Sp
Some Linux platforms have a maximum stack size.  Setting too large of a stack
size will cause thread creation to fail.
.Sp
If needed, \f(CW$new_size\fR will be rounded up to the next multiple of the memory
page size (usually 4096 or 8192).
.Sp
Threads created after the stack size is set will then either call
\&\f(CW\*(C`pthread_attr_setstacksize()\*(C'\fR \fI(for pthreads platforms)\fR, or supply the
stack size to \f(CW\*(C`CreateThread()\*(C'\fR \fI(for Win32 Perl)\fR.

.IP "threads\->create({'stack_size' => \s-1VALUE\s0}, \s-1FUNCTION, ARGS\s0)" 4
.IX Item "threads->create({'stack_size' => VALUE}, FUNCTION, ARGS)"
To specify a particular stack size for any individual thread, call

Here's another simplistic example that illustrates the use of thread
signalling in conjunction with a semaphore to provide rudimentary \fIsuspend\fR

\&\s-1CAVEAT: \s0 The thread signalling capability provided by this module does not

such that signal handlers are called in the appropriate thread.  For example,
sending \f(CW\*(C`$thr\->kill(\*(AqSTOP\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR does not actually suspend a thread (or the
whole process), but does cause a \f(CW$SIG{\*(AqSTOP\*(Aq}\fR handler to be called in that
thread (as illustrated above).
.PP
As such, signals that would normally not be appropriate to use in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`kill()\*(C'\fR command (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`kill(\*(AqKILL\*(Aq, $$)\*(C'\fR) are okay to use with the

.PP
Correspondingly, sending a signal to a thread does not disrupt the operation
the thread is currently working on:  The signal will be acted upon after the
current operation has completed.  For instance, if the thread is \fIstuck\fR on
an I/O call, sending it a signal will not cause the I/O call to be interrupted
such that the signal is acted up immediately.

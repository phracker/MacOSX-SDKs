.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \f(CW\*(C`Devel::StackTrace\*(C'\fR module contains two classes, \f(CW\*(C`Devel::StackTrace\*(C'\fR and
Devel::StackTrace::Frame. These objects encapsulate the information that
can retrieved via Perl's \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR function, as well as providing a simple
interface to this data.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Devel::StackTrace\*(C'\fR object contains a set of \f(CW\*(C`Devel::StackTrace::Frame\*(C'\fR
objects, one for each level of the stack. The frames contain all the data
available from \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This code was created to support my Exception::Class::Base class (part of
Exception::Class) but may be useful in other contexts.
.SH "'TOP' AND 'BOTTOM' OF THE STACK"
.IX Header "'TOP' AND 'BOTTOM' OF THE STACK"
When describing the methods of the trace object, I use the words 'top' and
\&'bottom'. In this context, the 'top' frame on the stack is the most recent
frame and the 'bottom' is the least recent.
.PP
Here's an example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  foo();  # bottom frame is here
\&
\&  sub foo {
\&     bar();
\&  }
\&
\&  sub bar {
\&     Devel::StackTrace\->new;  # top frame is here.
\&  }
.Ve
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
This class provide the following methods:
.SS "Devel::StackTrace\->new(%named_params)"
.IX Subsection "Devel::StackTrace->new(%named_params)"
Returns a new Devel::StackTrace object.
.PP
Takes the following parameters:
.IP "\(bu" 4
frame_filter => \f(CW$sub\fR
.Sp
By default, Devel::StackTrace will include all stack frames before the call to
its constructor.
.Sp
However, you may want to filter out some frames with more granularity than
\&'ignore_package' or 'ignore_class' allow.
.Sp
You can provide a subroutine which is called with the raw frame data for each
frame. This is a hash reference with two keys, \*(L"caller\*(R", and \*(L"args\*(R", both of
which are array references. The \*(L"caller\*(R" key is the raw data as returned by
Perl's \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR function, and the \*(L"args\*(R" key are the subroutine arguments
found in \f(CW@DB::args\fR.
.Sp
The filter should return true if the frame should be included, or false if it
should be skipped.
.IP "\(bu" 4
filter_frames_early => \f(CW$boolean\fR
.Sp
If this parameter is true, \f(CW\*(C`frame_filter\*(C'\fR will be called as soon as the
stacktrace is created, and before refs are stringified (if
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsafe_ref_capture\*(C'\fR is not set), rather than being filtered lazily when
Devel::StackTrace::Frame objects are first needed.
.Sp
This is useful if you want to filter based on the frame's arguments and want
to be able to examine object properties, for example.
.IP "\(bu" 4
ignore_package => \f(CW$package_name\fR \s-1OR\s0 \e@package_names
.Sp
Any frames where the package is one of these packages will not be on the
stack.
.IP "\(bu" 4
ignore_class => \f(CW$package_name\fR \s-1OR\s0 \e@package_names
.Sp
Any frames where the package is a subclass of one of these packages (or is the
same package) will not be on the stack.
.Sp
Devel::StackTrace internally adds itself to the 'ignore_package' parameter,
meaning that the Devel::StackTrace package is \fB\s-1ALWAYS\s0\fR ignored. However, if
you create a subclass of Devel::StackTrace it will not be ignored.
.IP "\(bu" 4
skip_frames => \f(CW$integer\fR
.Sp
This will cause this number of stack frames to be excluded from top of the
stack trace. This prevents the frames from being captured at all, and applies
before the \f(CW\*(C`frame_filter\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ignore_package\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`ignore_class\*(C'\fR options,
even with \f(CW\*(C`filter_frames_early\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
unsafe_ref_capture => \f(CW$boolean\fR
.Sp
If this parameter is true, then Devel::StackTrace will store references
internally when generating stacktrace frames.
.Sp
\&\fBThis option is very dangerous, and should never be used with exception
objects\fR. Using this option will keep any objects or references alive past
their normal lifetime, until the stack trace object goes out of scope. It can
keep objects alive even after their \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR sub is called, resulting it it
being called multiple times on the same object.
.Sp
If not set, Devel::StackTrace replaces any references with their stringified
representation.
.IP "\(bu" 4
no_args => \f(CW$boolean\fR
.Sp
If this parameter is true, then Devel::StackTrace will not store caller
arguments in stack trace frames at all.
.IP "\(bu" 4
respect_overload => \f(CW$boolean\fR
.Sp
By default, Devel::StackTrace will call \f(CW\*(C`overload::AddrRef\*(C'\fR to get the
underlying string representation of an object, instead of respecting the
object's stringification overloading. If you would prefer to see the
overloaded representation of objects in stack traces, then set this parameter
to true.
.IP "\(bu" 4
max_arg_length => \f(CW$integer\fR
.Sp
By default, Devel::StackTrace will display the entire argument for each
subroutine call. Setting this parameter causes truncates each subroutine
argument's string representation if it is longer than this number of
characters.
.IP "\(bu" 4
message => \f(CW$string\fR
.Sp
By default, Devel::StackTrace will use 'Trace begun' as the message for the
first stack frame when you call \f(CW\*(C`as_string\*(C'\fR. You can supply an alternative
message using this option.
.IP "\(bu" 4
indent => \f(CW$boolean\fR
.Sp
If this parameter is true, each stack frame after the first will start with a
tab character, just like \f(CW\*(C`Carp::confess\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS "$trace\->next_frame"
.el .SS "\f(CW$trace\fP\->next_frame"
.IX Subsection "$trace->next_frame"
Returns the next Devel::StackTrace::Frame object on the stack, going
down. If this method hasn't been called before it returns the first frame. It
returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR when it reaches the bottom of the stack and then resets its
pointer so the next call to \f(CW\*(C`$trace\->next_frame\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`$trace\->prev_frame\*(C'\fR will work properly.
.ie n .SS "$trace\->prev_frame"
.el .SS "\f(CW$trace\fP\->prev_frame"
.IX Subsection "$trace->prev_frame"
Returns the next Devel::StackTrace::Frame object on the stack, going up. If
this method hasn't been called before it returns the last frame. It returns
undef when it reaches the top of the stack and then resets its pointer so the
next call to \f(CW\*(C`$trace\->next_frame\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`$trace\->prev_frame\*(C'\fR will work
properly.
.ie n .SS "$trace\->reset_pointer"
.el .SS "\f(CW$trace\fP\->reset_pointer"
.IX Subsection "$trace->reset_pointer"
Resets the pointer so that the next call to \f(CW\*(C`$trace\->next_frame\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`$trace\->prev_frame\*(C'\fR will start at the top or bottom of the stack, as
appropriate.
.ie n .SS "$trace\->frames"
.el .SS "\f(CW$trace\fP\->frames"
.IX Subsection "$trace->frames"
When this method is called with no arguments, it returns a list of
Devel::StackTrace::Frame objects. They are returned in order from top (most
recent) to bottom.
.PP
This method can also be used to set the object's frames if you pass it a list
of Devel::StackTrace::Frame objects.
.PP
This is useful if you want to filter the list of frames in ways that are more
complex than can be handled by the \f(CW\*(C`$trace\->filter_frames\*(C'\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $stacktrace\->frames( my_filter( $stacktrace\->frames ) );
.Ve
.ie n .SS "$trace\->frame($index)"
.el .SS "\f(CW$trace\fP\->frame($index)"
.IX Subsection "$trace->frame($index)"
Given an index, this method returns the relevant frame, or undef if there is
no frame at that index. The index is exactly like a Perl array. The first
frame is 0 and negative indexes are allowed.
.ie n .SS "$trace\->frame_count"
.el .SS "\f(CW$trace\fP\->frame_count"
.IX Subsection "$trace->frame_count"
Returns the number of frames in the trace object.
.ie n .SS "$trace\->as_string(\e%p)"
.el .SS "\f(CW$trace\fP\->as_string(\e%p)"
.IX Subsection "$trace->as_string(%p)"
Calls \f(CW\*(C`$frame\->as_string\*(C'\fR on each frame from top to bottom, producing
output quite similar to the Carp module's cluck/confess methods.
.PP
The optional \f(CW\*(C`\e%p\*(C'\fR parameter only has one option. The \f(CW\*(C`max_arg_length\*(C'\fR
parameter truncates each subroutine argument's string representation if it is
longer than this number of characters.
.PP
If all the frames in a trace are skipped then this just returns the \f(CW\*(C`message\*(C'\fR
passed to the constructor or the string \f(CW"Trace begun"\fR.
.ie n .SS "$trace\->message"
.el .SS "\f(CW$trace\fP\->message"
.IX Subsection "$trace->message"
Returns the message passed to the constructor. If this wasn't passed then this
method returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.

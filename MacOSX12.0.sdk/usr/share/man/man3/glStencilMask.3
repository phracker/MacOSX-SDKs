.SH NAME
.B "glStencilMask
\- control the writing of individual bits in the stencil planes

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glStencilMask\fP(
GLuint \fImask\fP )
.nf
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2mask\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2mask\fP
Specifies a bit mask to enable and disable writing of individual bits
in the stencil planes.
Initially, the mask is all 1's.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glStencilMask\fP controls the writing of individual bits in the stencil planes.
The least significant n bits of \f2mask\fP,
where n is the number of bits in the stencil buffer,
specify a mask.
Where a 1 appears in the mask,
it's possible to write to the corresponding bit in the stencil buffer.
Where a 0 appears,
the corresponding bit is write-protected.
Initially, all bits are enabled for writing.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glStencilMask\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_STENCIL_WRITEMASK\fP
.br
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_STENCIL_BITS\fP

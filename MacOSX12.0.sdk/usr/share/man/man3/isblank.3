.Dt ISBLANK 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isblank
.Nd space or tab character test
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isblank "int c"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isblank
function tests for a space or tab character.
For any locale, this includes the following standard characters:
.Pp
.Bl -column \&`\et''___ \&``\et''___
.It "\&``\et''\t`` ''"
.El
.Pp
In the "C" locale, a successful
.Fn isblank
test is limited to these characters only.
The value of the argument must be representable as an
.Vt "unsigned char"
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isblank
function returns zero if the character tests false and
returns non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswblank
function should be used instead.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ctype 3 ,
.Xr isalnum_l 3 ,
.Xr iswblank 3 ,
.Xr ascii 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isblank
function
conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .

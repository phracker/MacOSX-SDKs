\f2c\fP
Specifies the index used when the color index buffers are cleared.
The initial value is 0.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glClearIndex\fP specifies the index used by \%\f3glClear\fP
to clear the color index buffers.
\f2c\fP is not clamped.
Rather,
\f2c\fP is converted to a fixed-point value with unspecified precision
to the right of the binary point.
The integer part of this value is then masked with 2^m,
where m is the number of bits in a color index stored in the frame buffer.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glClearIndex\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_INDEX_CLEAR_VALUE\fP
.br
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_INDEX_BITS\fP

.Dt REALPATH 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm realpath
.Nd returns the canonicalized absolute pathname
.\" .Sh LIBRARY
.\" .Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft "char *"
.Fo realpath
.Fa "const char *restrict file_name"
.Fa "char *restrict resolved_name"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn realpath
function resolves all symbolic links, extra
.Dq /
characters, and references to
.Pa /./
and
.Pa /../
in
.Fa file_name .
If the
.Fa resolved_name
argument
is non-NULL, the resulting absolute pathname is copied there (it
.Em must
refer to a buffer capable of storing at least
.Dv PATH_MAX
characters).
.Pp
As a permitted extension to the standard, if
.Fa resolved_name
is NULL, 
memory is allocated for the resulting absolute pathname, and is returned by
.Fn realpath .
This memory should be freed by a call to
.Xr free 3
when no longer needed.
.Pp
The
.Fn realpath
function will resolve both absolute and relative paths
and return the absolute pathname corresponding to
.Fa file_name .
All components of
.Fa file_name
must exist when
.Fn realpath
is called.
.Sh "RETURN VALUES"
On success, the
.Fn realpath
function returns the address of the resulting absolute pathname, which is
.Fa resolved_name
if it was non-NULL, or the address of newly allocated memory.
If an error occurs,
.Fn realpath
returns
.Dv NULL .
If
.Fa resolved_name
was non-NULL, it will
contain the pathname which caused the problem.
.Sh VARIANTS
Defining 
.Dv _DARWIN_C_SOURCE
or
.Dv _DARWIN_BETTER_REALPATH
before including stdlib.h will cause the provided implementation of
.Fn realpath
to use F_GETPATH from
.Xr fcntl 2
to discover the path.
.Sh ERRORS
The function
.Fn realpath
may fail and set the external variable
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library functions
.Xr alloca 3 ,
.Xr getattrlist 2 ,
.Xr getcwd 3 ,
.Xr lstat 2 ,
.Xr readlink 2 ,
.Xr stat 2 ,
and
.Xr strdup 3 .
.\" .Sh CAVEATS
.\" This implementation of
.\" .Fn realpath
.\" differs slightly from the Solaris implementation.
.\" The
.\" .Bx 4.4
.\" version always returns absolute pathnames,
.\" whereas the Solaris implementation will,
.\" under certain circumstances, return a relative
.\" .Fa resolved_name
.\" when given a relative
.\" .Fa file_name .
.Sh LEGACY SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <stdlib.h>
.Pp
The include file
.In sys/param.h
is necessary.
.Sh LEGACY DESCRIPTION
In legacy mode,
the last component of
.Fa file_name
does not need to exist when
.Fn realpath
is called.
.Sh "SEE ALSO"
.Xr free 3 ,
.Xr getcwd 3 ,
.Xr compat 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn realpath
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .

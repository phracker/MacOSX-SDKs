.Sh NAME
.Nm sin 
.Nd sine function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn sin "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn sinl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn sinf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sin
function computes the sine of
.Fa x
(measured in radians).
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn sin "±0"
returns ±0.
.Pp
.Fn sin "±infinity"
returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn sin
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>

.Ft vFloat
.Fn vsinf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vsincosf "vFloat x" "vFloat *c" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvsinf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvsin "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.br

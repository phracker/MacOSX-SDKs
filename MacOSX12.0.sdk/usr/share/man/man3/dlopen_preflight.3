.Sh NAME
.Nm dlopen_preflight
.Nd preflight the load of a dynamic library or bundle
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In dlfcn.h
.Ft bool
.Fn dlopen_preflight "const char* path"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn dlopen_preflight
examines the mach-o file specified by 
.Fa path .
It checks if the file and libraries it depends on are all compatible with the current process. 
That is, they contain the correct architecture and are not otherwise ABI incompatible.
.Pp
.Fn dlopen_preflight
was created for the PowerPC to Intel transition for use by apps with plugins that the user chooses to load.
The app could use dlopen_preflight() to show only loadable plugins to the user (such as in a menu).
.Pp
This is potentially an expensive call because it may internally do the same as dlopen/dlclose.  Only
use dlopen_preflight() if you need to show the user a list of potentially loadable plugins.
.Pp
.Fn dlopen_preflight
was first available in Mac OS X 10.5.
.Sh SEARCHING
.Fn dlopen_preflight
uses the same steps as 
.Fn dlopen
to find a compatible mach-o file.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn dlopen_preflight
returns true on if the mach-o file is compatible.  If the file is not compatible, it returns false 
and sets an error string that can be examined with
.Fn dlerror .

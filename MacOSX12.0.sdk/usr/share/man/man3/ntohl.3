.Dt BYTEORDER 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm htonl ,
.Nm htons ,
.Nm htonll ,
.Nm ntohl ,
.Nm ntohs ,
.Nm ntohll
.Nd convert values between host and network byte order
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In arpa/inet.h
.Ft uint64_t
.Fn htonll "uint64_t hostlonglong"
.Ft uint32_t
.Fn htonl "uint32_t hostlong"
.Ft uint16_t
.Fn htons "uint16_t hostshort"
.Ft uint64_t
.Fn ntohll "uint64_t netlonglong"
.Ft uint32_t
.Fn ntohl "uint32_t netlong"
.Ft uint16_t
.Fn ntohs "uint16_t netshort"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines convert 16 bit, 32 bit, and 64 bit quantities between network
byte order and host byte order.
(Network byte order is big endian, or most significant byte first.)
On machines which have a byte order which is the same as the network
order, routines are defined as null macros.
.Pp
These routines are most often used in conjunction with Internet
addresses and ports as returned by
.Xr gethostbyname 3
and
.Xr getservent 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gethostbyname 3 ,
.Xr getservent 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm byteorder
functions except
.Nm htonll
and
.Nm ntohll
are expected to conform with IEEE Std POSIX.1-200x
.Pq Dq POSIX.1
.Sh HISTORY
The
functions
.Nm htonl,
.Nm htons,
.Nm ntohl,
.Nm ntohs
appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Pp
The functions
.Nm htonll
and
.Nm ntohll
first appeared in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite).
.Sh BUGS
On the
.Tn VAX
bytes are handled backwards from most everyone else in
the world.  This is not expected to be fixed in the near future.

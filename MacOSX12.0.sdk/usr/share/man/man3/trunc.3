.Sh NAME
.Nm trunc
.Nd truncate to integer value
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn trunc "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn truncl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn truncf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn trunc
functions return the integral value nearest to but no larger in magnitude than
.Fa x .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn trunc "±0"
returns ±0.
.Pp
.Fn trunc "±infinity"
returns ±infinity.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn trunc
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vintf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvintf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvint "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ceil 3 ,
.Xr floor 3 ,
.Xr round 3 ,
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn trunc
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

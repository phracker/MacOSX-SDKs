.Sh NAME
.Nm vfork
.Nd deprecated system call to create a new process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft pid_t
.Fn vfork void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
system call can be used to create new processes. As of macOS 12.0,
this system call behaves identically to the
.Xr fork 2
system call, except without calling any handlers registered with
.Xr pthread_atfork 2 .
.Pp
This system call is deprecated. In a future release, it may begin to return
errors in all cases, or may be removed entirely.
It is extremely strongly recommended to replace
all uses with
.Xr fork 2
or, ideally,
.Xr posix_spawn 3 .

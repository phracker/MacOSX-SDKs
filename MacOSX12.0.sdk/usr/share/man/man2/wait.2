.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wait
function suspends execution of its calling process until
.Fa stat_loc
information is available for a terminated child process,
or a signal is received.
On return from a successful 
.Fn wait
call, 
the
.Fa stat_loc
area contains termination information about the process that exited
as defined below.
.Pp
The
.Fn wait4
call provides a more general interface for programs
that need to wait for certain child processes,
that need resource utilization statistics accumulated by child processes,
or that require options.
The other wait functions are implemented using
.Fn wait4 .
.Pp
The
.Fa pid
parameter specifies the set of child processes for which to wait.
If
.Fa pid
is -1, the call waits for any child process.
If
.Fa pid
is 0,
the call waits for any child process in the process group of the caller.
If
.Fa pid
is greater than zero, the call waits for the process with process id
.Fa pid .
If
.Fa pid
is less than -1, the call waits for any process whose process group id
equals the absolute value of
.Fa pid .
.Pp
The
.Fa stat_loc
parameter is defined below.  The
.Fa options
parameter contains the bitwise OR of any of the following options.
The
.Dv WNOHANG
option
is used to indicate that the call should not block if
there are no processes that wish to report status.
If the
.Dv WUNTRACED
option is set,
children of the current process that are stopped
due to a
.Dv SIGTTIN , SIGTTOU , SIGTSTP ,
or
.Dv SIGSTOP
signal also have
their status reported.
.Pp
If
.Fa rusage
is non-zero, a summary of the resources used by the terminated
process and all its
children is returned (this information is currently not available
for stopped processes).
.Pp
When the
.Dv WNOHANG
option is specified and no processes
wish to report status, 
.Fn wait4
returns a 
process id
of 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn waitpid
call is identical to
.Fn wait4
with an
.Fa rusage
value of zero.
The older
.Fn wait3
call is the same as
.Fn wait4
with a
.Fa pid
value of -1.
.Pp
The following macros may be used to test the manner of exit of the process.
One of the first three macros will evaluate to a non-zero (true) value:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fn WIFEXITED status
True if the process terminated normally by a call to
.Xr _exit 2
or
.Xr exit 3 .
.It Fn WIFSIGNALED status
True if the process terminated due to receipt of a signal.
.It Fn WIFSTOPPED status
True if the process has not terminated, but has stopped and can be restarted.
This macro can be true only if the wait call specified the
.Dv WUNTRACED
option
or if the child process is being traced (see
.Xr ptrace 2 ) .
.El
.Pp
Depending on the values of those macros, the following macros
produce the remaining status information about the child process:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fn WEXITSTATUS status
If
.Fn WIFEXITED status
is true, evaluates to the low-order 8 bits
of the argument passed to
.Xr _exit 2
or
.Xr exit 3
by the child.
.It Fn WTERMSIG status
If
.Fn WIFSIGNALED status
is true, evaluates to the number of the signal
that caused the termination of the process.
.It Fn WCOREDUMP status
If
.Fn WIFSIGNALED status
is true, evaluates as true if the termination
of the process was accompanied by the creation of a core file
containing an image of the process when the signal was received.
.It Fn WSTOPSIG status
If
.Fn WIFSTOPPED status
is true, evaluates to the number of the signal
that caused the process to stop.
.El
.Sh NOTES
See
.Xr sigaction 2
for a list of termination signals.
A status of 0 indicates normal termination.
.Pp
If a parent process terminates without
waiting for all of its child processes to terminate,
the remaining child processes are assigned the parent
process 1 ID (the init process ID).
.Pp
If a signal is caught while any of the
.Fn wait
calls is pending,
the call may be interrupted or restarted when the signal-catching routine
returns,
depending on the options in effect for the signal;
see
.Xr intro 2 ,
System call restart.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fn wait
returns due to a stopped
or terminated child process, the process ID of the child
is returned to the calling process.  Otherwise, a value of -1
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
If
.Fn wait3 ,
.Fn wait4 ,
or
.Fn waitpid
returns due to a stopped
or terminated child process, the process ID of the child
is returned to the calling process.
If there are no children not previously awaited,
-1 is returned with
.Va errno
set to
.Bq Er ECHILD .
Otherwise, if
.Dv WNOHANG
is specified and there are
no stopped or exited children,
0 is returned.
If an error is detected or a caught signal aborts the call,
a value of -1
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn wait
system call will fail and return immediately if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er ECHILD
The calling process has no existing unwaited-for child processes.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa status
or
.Fa rusage
argument points to an illegal address
(may not be detected before the exit of a child process).
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Invalid or undefined flags are passed in the
.Fa options
argument.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn wait3
and
.Fn waitpid
calls will fail and return immediately if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er ECHILD
The process specified by
.Fa pid
does not exist or is not a child of the calling process,
or the process group specified by
.Fa pid
does not exist or does not have any member process
that is a child of the calling process.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn waitpid
call will fail and return immediately if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The options argument is not valid.
.El
.Pp
Any of these calls will fail and return immediately if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EINTR
The call is interrupted by a caught signal
or the signal does not have the
.Dv SA_RESTART
flag set.
.El
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wait
and
.Fn waitpid
functions are defined by POSIX;
.Fn wait3
and
.Fn wait4
are not specified by POSIX.
The
.Fn WCOREDUMP
macro
and the ability to restart a pending
.Fn wait
call are extensions to the POSIX interface.

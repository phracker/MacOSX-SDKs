.Sh NAME
.Nm stab
.Nd symbol table types
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <mach-o/stab.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Aq Pa stab.h
defines some of the symbol table
.Fa n_type
field values for Mach-O a.out files.
These are the types for permanent symbols (i.e. not local labels, etc.)
used by the old debugger
.Em sdb
and the Berkeley Pascal compiler
.Xr pc 1 .
Symbol table entries can be produced by the
.Pa .stabs
assembler directive.
This allows one to specify a double-quote delimited name, a symbol type,
one char and one short of information about the symbol, and an unsigned
long (usually an address).
To avoid having to produce an explicit label for the address field,
the
.Pa .stabd
directive can be used to implicitly address the current location.
If no name is needed, symbol table entries can be generated using the
.Pa .stabn
directive.
The loader promises to preserve the order of symbol table entries produced
by
.Pa .stab
directives.
As described in comments in <mach-o/nlist.h>
an element of the symbol table
consists of the following structure:
.Bd -literal
/*
* Format of a symbol table entry.
*/

struct nlist {
	union {
		char	*n_name;	/* for use when in-core */
		long	n_strx;		/* index into file string table */
	} n_un;
	unsigned char	n_type;		/* type flag */
	char		n_sect;		/* section number or NO_SECT */
	short		n_desc;		/* see struct desc, below */
	unsigned	n_value;	/* address or offset or line */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The low bits of the
.Fa n_type
field are used for the symbol type,
according to the following masks, defined in
.Aq Pa nlist.h .
A symbol can be of none these types by having none of these bits set.
.Bd -literal
/*
* Simple values for n_type.
*/

#define	N_UNDF	0x0	/* undefined */
#define	N_ABS	0x2	/* absolute */
#define	N_SECT	0xe	/* defined in section number n_sect */

#define	N_EXT	01	/* external bit, or'ed in */
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa n_value
field of a symbol is relocated by the linker,
.Xr ld 1
as an address within the appropriate section for N_SECT types based on the.
.Fa N_value
fields of symbols not in any segment are unchanged by the linker.
In addition, the linker will discard certain symbols, according to rules
of its own, unless the
.Fa n_type
field has one of the following bits set:
.Bd -literal
/*
* Other permanent symbol table entries have some of the N_STAB bits set.
* These are given in <stab.h>
*/

#define	N_STAB	0xe0	/* if any of these bits set, don't discard */
.Ed
.Pp
This allows up to 112 (7 \(** 16) symbol types, split between the various
symbol types.
Some of these have already been claimed.
The old symbolic debugger,
.Em sdb ,
uses the following n_type values:
.Bd -literal
#define	N_GSYM	0x20	/* global symbol: name,,NO_SECT,type,0 */
#define	N_FNAME	0x22	/* procedure name (f77 kludge): name,,NO_SECT */
#define	N_FUN	0x24	/* procedure: name,,n_sect,linenumber,address */
#define	N_STSYM	0x26	/* static symbol: name,,n_sect,type,address */
#define	N_LCSYM	0x28	/* .lcomm symbol: name,,n_sect,type,address */
#define	N_BNSYM	0x2e	/* begin nsect sym: 0,,n_sect,0,address */
#define	N_RSYM	0x40	/* register sym: name,,NO_SECT,type,register */
#define	N_SLINE	0x44	/* src line: 0,,n_sect,linenumber,address */
#define	N_ENSYM	0x4e	/* end nsect sym: 0,,n_sect,0,address */
#define	N_SSYM	0x60	/* structure elt: name,,NO_SECT,type,struct_offset */
#define	N_SO	0x64	/* source file name: name,,n_sect,0,address */
#define	N_LSYM	0x80	/* local sym: name,,NO_SECT,type,offset */
#define	N_BINCL	0x82	/* include file beginning: name,,NO_SECT,0,sum */
#define	N_SOL	0x84	/* #included file name: name,,n_sect,0,address */
#define	N_PSYM	0xa0	/* parameter: name,,NO_SECT,type,offset */
#define	N_EINCL	0xa2	/* include file end: name,,NO_SECT,0,0 */
#define	N_ENTRY	0xa4	/* alternate entry: name,,n_sect,linenumber,address */
#define	N_LBRAC	0xc0	/* left bracket: 0,,NO_SECT,nesting level,address */
#define	N_EXCL	0xc2	/* deleted include file: name,,NO_SECT,0,sum */
#define	N_RBRAC	0xe0	/* right bracket: 0,,NO_SECT,nesting level,address */
#define	N_BCOMM	0xe2	/* begin common: name,,NO_SECT,0,0 */
#define	N_ECOMM	0xe4	/* end common: name,,n_sect,0,0 */
#define	N_ECOML	0xe8	/* end common (local name): 0,,n_sect_,0,address */
#define	N_LENG	0xfe	/* second stab entry with length information */

where the comments give
.Em sdb
conventional use for
.Pa .stab
.Fa s
and the
.Fa n_name ,
.Fa n_sect ,
.Fa n_desc ,
and
.Fa n_value
fields
of the given
.Fa n_type .
.Em Sdb
uses the
.Fa n_desc
field to hold a type specifier in the form used
by the Portable C Compiler,
.Xr cc 1 ;
see the header file
.Pa pcc.h
for details on the format of these type values.
.Pp
The Berkeley Pascal compiler,
.Xr pc 1 ,
uses the following
.Fa n_type
value:
.Bd -literal
#define	N_PC	0x30	/* global pascal symbol: name,,NO_SECT,subtype,line */
.Ed
.Pp
and uses the following subtypes to do type checking across separately
compiled files:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
1	source file name
2	included file name
3	global label
4	global constant
5	global type
6	global variable
7	global function
8	global procedure
9	external function
10	external procedure
11	library variable
12	library routine

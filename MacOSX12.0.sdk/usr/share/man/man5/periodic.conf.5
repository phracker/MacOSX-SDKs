.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm periodic.conf
.Nd periodic job configuration information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains a description of how daily, weekly and monthly system maintenance
jobs should run.
It resides in the
.Pa /etc/defaults
directory and parts may be overridden by a file of the same name in
.Pa /etc ,
which itself may be overridden by the
.Pa /etc/periodic.conf.local
file.
.Pp
The
.Nm
file
is actually sourced as a shell script from each of the periodic scripts
and is intended to simply provide default configuration variables.
.Pp
The following variables are used by
.Xr periodic 8
itself:
.Bl -tag -offset 4n -width 2n
.It Va local_periodic
.Pq Vt str
List of directories to search for periodic scripts.
This list is always prefixed with
.Pa /etc/periodic ,
and is only used when an argument to
.Xr periodic 8
is not an absolute directory name.
.It Ao Ar dir Ac Ns Va _output
.Pq Vt path No or Vt list
What to do with the output of the scripts executed from
the directory
.Ar dir .
If this variable is set to an absolute path name, output is logged to
that file, otherwise it is taken as one or more space separated email
addresses and mailed to those users.
If this variable is not set or is empty, output is sent to standard output.
.Pp
For an unattended machine, suitable values for
.Va daily_output ,
.Va weekly_output ,
and
.Va monthly_output
might be
.Dq Li /var/log/daily.log ,
.Dq Li /var/log/weekly.log ,
and
.Dq Li /var/log/monthly.log
respectively, as
.Xr newsyslog 8
will rotate these files (if they exists) at the appropriate times.
.It Ao Ar dir Ac Ns Va _show_success
.It Ao Ar dir Ac Ns Va _show_info
.It Ao Ar dir Ac Ns Va _show_badconfig
.Pq Vt bool
These variables control whether
.Xr periodic 8
will mask the output of the executed scripts based on their return code
(where
.Ar dir
is the base directory name in which each script resides).
If the return code of a script is
.Sq 0
and
.Ao Ar dir Ac Ns Va _show_success
is set to
.Dq Li NO ,
.Xr periodic 8
will mask the script's output.
If the return code of a script is
.Sq 1
and
.Ao Ar dir Ac Ns Va _show_info
is set to
.Dq Li NO ,
.Xr periodic 8
will mask the script's output.
If the return code of a script is
.Sq 2
and
.Ao Ar dir Ac Ns Va _show_badconfig
is set to
.Dq Li NO ,
.Xr periodic 8
will mask the script's output.
If these variables are set to neither
.Dq Li YES
nor
.Dq Li NO ,
they default to
.Dq Li YES ,
.Dq Li YES
and
.Dq Li NO
respectively.
.Pp
Refer to the
.Xr periodic 8
manual page for how script return codes are interpreted.

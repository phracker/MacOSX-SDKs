.Dt GROUP 5
.Os "Mac OS X"
.Sh NAME
.Nm group
.Nd format of the group permissions file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The file
.Aq Pa /etc/group
consists of newline separated
.Tn ASCII
records, one per group, containing four colon
.Ql \&:
separated fields. These fields are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width password -offset indent -compact
.It group
Name of the group.
.It passwd
Group's
.Em encrypted
password.
.It gid
The group's decimal ID.
.It member
Group members.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar group
field is the group name used for granting file access to users
who are members of the group.
The
.Ar gid
field is the number associated with the group name.
They should both be unique across the system (and often
across a group of systems) since they control file access.
The
.Ar passwd
field
is an optional
.Em encrypted
password.
This field is rarely used
and an asterisk is normally placed in it rather than leaving it blank.
The 
.Ar member
field contains the names of users granted the privileges of
.Ar group .
The member names are separated by commas without spaces or newlines.
A user is automatically in a group if that group was specified
in their
.Pa /etc/passwd
entry and does not need to be added to that group in the
.Pa /etc/group file.
.\" .Pp
.\" When the system reads the file
.\" .Pa /etc/group
.\" the fields are read into the structure
.\" .Fa group
.\" declared in
.\" .Aq Pa grp.h :
.\" .Bd -literal -offset indent
.\" struct group {
.\"	char    *gr_name;        /* group name */
.\"	char    *gr_passwd;      /* group password */
.\"	int     gr_gid;          /* group id */
.\"	char    **gr_mem;        /* group members */
.\" };

.Sh INTERACTION WITH DIRECTORY SERVICES
Processes generally find group records using one of the
.Xr getgrent 3
family of functions.
On Mac OS X, these functions interact with the
.Xr DirectoryService 8
daemon,
which reads the /etc/group file as well as searching other directory information services
to determine groups and group membership.

Automatic reporting of diagnostic information is off by default and no information is sent to Apple unless a user has opted-in to automatic collection of
diagnostic information.  A user is offered the opportunity to opt-in for automatic collection of additional diagnostic and usage information after the user
has manually sent a crash, hang or panic report to Apple.  Users may at any time opt in or out of automatic reporting in the Security & Privacy pane of the
System Preferences application under the "Privacy" tab.

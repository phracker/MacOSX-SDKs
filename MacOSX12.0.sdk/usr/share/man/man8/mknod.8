.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command creates device special files.
.Pp
To make nodes manually, the required arguments are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width majorx
.It Ar name
Device name, for example
.Dq sd
for a SCSI disk on an HP300 or a
.Dq pty
for pseudo-devices.
.It Cm b | Cm c | Cm w
Type of device. If the
device is a block type device such as a tape or disk drive which needs
both cooked and raw special files,
the type is
.Cm b .
Whiteout nodes are type
.Cm w .
All other devices are character type devices, such as terminal
and pseudo devices, and are type
.Cm c .
.It Ar major
The major device number is an integer number which tells the kernel
which device driver entry point to use.
.It Ar minor
The minor device number tells the kernel which one of several similar
devices the node corresponds to; for example, it may be a specific serial
port or pty.
.It Ar unit and subunit
The unit and subunit numbers select a subset of a device; for example, the
unit may specify a particular SCSI disk, and the subunit a partition on
that disk.  (Currently this form of specification is only supported by the
.Ar bsdos
format, for compatibility with the
.Bsx
.Xr mknod 8 . )
.El
.Pp
Device numbers for different operating systems may be packed in a different
format.  To create device nodes that may be used by such an operating system
(e.g. in an exported file system used for netbooting), the
.Fl F
option is used.  The following formats are recognized:
native,
386bsd,
4bsd,
bsdos,
freebsd,
hpux,
isc,
linux,
netbsd,
osf1,
sco,
solaris,
sunos,
svr3,
svr4 and
ultrix.
.Pp
Alternatively, a single opaque device number may be specified.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command manipulates the address mapping table
used by Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Dump the currently existing NDP entries.
.It Fl A Ar wait
Repeat
.Fl a
(dump NDP entries)
every
.Ar wait
seconds.
.It Fl c
Erase all the NDP entries.
.It Fl d
Delete specified NDP entry.
.It Fl f
Parse the file specified by
.Ar filename .
.It Fl H
Harmonize consistency between the routing table and the default router
list; install the top entry of the list into the kernel routing table.
.It Fl I Op Cm delete | Ar interface
Shows or specifies the default interface used as the default route when
there is no default router.
If no argument is given to the option,
the current default interface will be shown.
If an
.Ar interface
is specified, the interface will be used as the default.
If a special keyword
.Ic delete
is specified, the current default interface will be deleted from the kernel.
.It Fl i Ar interface Op Ar flags...
View ND information for the specified interface.
If additional arguments
.Ar flags
are given,
.Nm
sets or clears the specified flags for the interface.
Possible flags are as follows.
All of the flags can begin with the
special character
.Ql - ,
which means the flag should be cleared.
.\"
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic nud
.Xc
turn on or off NUD (Neighbor Unreachability Detection) on the
interface.
NUD is usually turned on by default.
.It Xo
.Ic disabled
.Xc
IPv6 can be disabled separately from other network protocols. This flag can be
turned on automatically when Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) indicates that
another device on the network is using the same link-local address.
.It Xo
.Ic proxy_prefixes
.Xc
the interface is enabled to proxy neighbor discovery for global scope prefixes
matching those on link at other interfaces.
.It Xo
.Ic insecure
do not use cryptographically generated addresses (CGA) on this interface.
.Xc
.It Xo
.Ic replicated
Address autoconfiguration proceeds under the assumption that interface
configuration is replicated by a sleep proxy at another node on the link.
Disables optimistic DAD and sends unsolicited NA with O=1 when DAD completes.
Ignores DAD failures from other hardware addresses.
.Xc
.El
.It Fl l
Show link-layer reachability information.
.It Fl n
Do not try to resolve numeric address to hostname.
.It Fl p
Show prefix list.
.It Fl P
Flush all the entries in the prefix list.
.It Fl r
Show default router list.
.It Fl R
Flush all the entries in the default router list.
.It Fl s
Register an NDP entry for a node.
The entry will be permanent unless the word
.Li temp
is given in the command.
If the word
.Li proxy
is given, this system will act as an proxy NDP server,
responding to requests for
.Ar hostname
even though the host address is not its own.
.It Fl t
Print timestamp on each entries,
to make it possible to merge output with
.Xr tcpdump 1 .
Most useful when used with
.Fl A .
.It Fl x
Show extended link-layer reachability information in addition to that shown by
the
.Fl l
flag.
.It Fl w
Show the cryptographically generated address (CGA) parameters for the node.
.El

.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
command will exit with 0 on success, and non-zero on errors.

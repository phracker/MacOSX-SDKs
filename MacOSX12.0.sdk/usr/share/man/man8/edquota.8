.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Edquota
is a quota editor.  
By default, or if the 
.Fl u
flag is specified,
one or more users may be specified on the command line.
For each user a temporary file is created
with an ASCII representation of the current
disk quotas for that user.
The list of filesystems with user quotas is determined by
scanning the mounted filesystems for a
.Pa .quota.ops.user
file located at its root.
An editor is invoked on the ASCII file.
The editor invoked is 
.Xr vi 1
unless the environment variable 
.Ev EDITOR 
specifies otherwise.
.Pp
The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc.
Setting a quota to zero indicates that no quota should be imposed.
Setting a hard limit to one indicates that no allocations should
be permitted.
Setting a soft limit to one with a hard limit of zero
indicates that allocations should be permitted on
only a temporary basis (see 
.Fl t 
below).
The current usage information in the file is for informational purposes;
only the hard and soft limits can be changed.
.Pp
On leaving the editor,
.Nm edquota
reads the temporary file and modifies the binary
quota files to reflect the changes made.
The binary quota file,
.Pa .quota.user
is stored at the root of the filesystem.
The default filename and root location for the user
quotas cannot be overridden.
.Pp
If the 
.Fl p
flag is specified,
.Nm edquota
will duplicate the quotas of the prototypical user
specified for each user specified.
This is the normal mechanism used to
initialize quotas for groups of users.
.Pp
If the 
.Fl g 
flag is specified,
.Nm edquota
is invoked to edit the quotas of
one or more groups specified on the command line.
The list of filesystems with group quotas is determined by
scanning the mounted filesystems for a
.Pa .quota.ops.group
file located at its root.
Similarly, the binary quota file,
.Pa .quota.group
is stored at the root of the filesystem.
The default filename and root location for group
quotas cannot be overridden.
The 
.Fl p 
flag can be specified in conjunction with
the 
.Fl g 
flag to specify a prototypical group
to be duplicated among the listed set of groups.
.Pp
Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits
for a grace period that may be specified per filesystem.
Once the grace period has expired,
the soft limit is enforced as a hard limit.
The default grace period for a filesystem is specified in
.Pa /usr/include/sys/quota.h .
The 
.Fl t
flag can be used to change the grace period.
By default, or when invoked with the 
.Fl u
flag, the grace period is set for each filesystem with a
.Pa .quota.ops.user
file located at its root.
When invoked with the 
.Fl g
flag, the grace period is
set for each filesystem with a
.Pa .quota.ops.group
file located at its root.
The grace period may be specified in days, hours, minutes, or seconds.
Setting a grace period to zero indicates that the default
grace period should be imposed.
Setting a grace period to one second indicates that no
grace period should be granted.
.Pp
Only the super-user may edit quotas.
.Sh FILES
Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the
mounted filesystem.  The mount option files are empty files
whose existence indicates that quotas are to be enabled
for that filesystem.  The binary data files will be
created by edquota, if they don't already exist.

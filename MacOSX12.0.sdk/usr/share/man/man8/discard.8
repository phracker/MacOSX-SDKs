Postfix discard mail delivery agent
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBdiscard\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix \fBdiscard\fR(8) delivery agent processes
delivery requests from
the queue manager. Each request specifies a queue file, a sender
address, a next\-hop destination that is treated as the reason for
discarding the mail, and recipient information.
The reason may be prefixed with an RFC 3463\-compatible detail code.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

The \fBdiscard\fR(8) delivery agent pretends to deliver all recipients
in the delivery request, logs the "next\-hop" destination
as the reason for discarding the mail, updates the
queue file, and either marks recipients as finished or informs the
queue manager that delivery should be tried again at a later time.

Delivery status reports are sent to the \fBtrace\fR(8)
daemon as appropriate.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBdiscard\fR(8) mailer is not security\-sensitive. It does not talk
to the network, and can be run chrooted at fixed low privilege.
.SH "STANDARDS"
.na
.nf
RFC 3463 (Enhanced Status Codes)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).

Depending on the setting of the \fBnotify_classes\fR parameter,
the postmaster is notified of bounces and of other trouble.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically as \fBdiscard\fR(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

configuration files.
.IP "\fBdaemon_timeout (18000s)\fR"
How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a
request before it is terminated by a built\-in watchdog timer.
.IP "\fBdelay_logging_resolution_limit (2)\fR"
The maximal number of digits after the decimal point when logging
sub\-second delay values.
.IP "\fBdouble_bounce_sender (double\-bounce)\fR"
The sender address of postmaster notifications that are generated

The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process waits
for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBmax_use (100)\fR"
The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon
process will service before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBprocess_id (read\-only)\fR"
The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBprocess_name (read\-only)\fR"

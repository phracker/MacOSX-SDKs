.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Quotaon
announces to the system that disk quotas should be enabled on one or more
filesystems.
.Nm Quotaoff
announces to the system that the specified
filesystems should have disk quotas
turned off.
The filesystem must be mounted and it
must have the
appropriate mount option file located at its root, the
.Pa .quota.ops.user
file for user quota configuration, and the
.Pa .quota.ops.group
file for group quota configuration.
.Nm Quotaon
also expects each filesystem to have the appropriate
quota data files located at its root, the
.Pa .quota.user
file for user data, and the
.Pa .quota.group
file for group data.
These filenames and their root location cannot be overridden.
By default, 
.Nm quotaon
will attempt to enable both 
user and group quotas.
By default, 
.Nm quotaoff
will disable both
user and group quotas.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
If the
.Fl a
flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
.Nm quotaon Ns / Ns Nm quotaoff
will enable/disable any filesystems with an existing
mount option file at its root.  The mount option file
specifies the types of quotas that are to be configured.
.It Fl g
Only group quotas will be enabled/disabled.
The mount option file,
.Pa .quota.ops.group ,
must exist at the root of the filesystem.
.It Fl u
Only user quotas will be enabled/disabled.
The mount option file,
.Pa .quota.ops.user ,
must exist at the root of the filesystem.
.It Fl v
Causes
.Nm quotaon
and
.Nm quotaoff
to print a message for each filesystem where quotas are turned on or off.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
is equivalent to the default.
.Pp
Quotas for both users and groups will automatically be turned
on at filesystem mount if the appropriate mount option file
and binary data file is in place at its root.
.Sh FILES
Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the
mounted filesystem.  The mount option files are empty files
whose existence indicates that quotas are to be enabled
for that filesystem.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width .quota.ops.group -compact
.It Pa .quota.user
data file containing user quotas
.It Pa .quota.group
data file containing group quotas
.It Pa .quota.ops.user

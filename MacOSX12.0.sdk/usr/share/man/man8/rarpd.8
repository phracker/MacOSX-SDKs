.Sh NAME
.Nm rarpd 
.Nd Reverse ARP Daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rarpd 
.Op Fl adf
.Op Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rarpd
services Reverse ARP requests on the Ethernet connected to
.Ar interface.
Upon receiving a request, 
.Nm rarpd
maps the target hardware address to an IP address via its name, which 
must be present in both the
.Xr ethers 5
and 
.Xr hosts 5
databases.
If a host does not exist in both databases, the translation cannot
proceed and a reply will not be sent.
.Pp
Additionally, a request is honored only if the server
(i.e., the host that rarpd is running on)
can "boot" the target; that is, if the directory 
.Pa /tftpboot/ Ns Em ipaddr
exists, where 
.Rm ipaddr
is the target IP address.
.Pp
In normal operation, 
.Nm rarpd
forks a copy of itself and runs in
the background.  Anomalies and errors are reported via 
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If 
.Sq Fl a 
is omitted, an interface must be specified.
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode, with all the output to stderr.
This option implies the 
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl f
Run in the foreground.

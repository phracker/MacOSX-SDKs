.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command mounts the WebDAV-enabled server directory at
.Ar [scheme://]host[:port][/path]
at the mount point indicated by
.Ar node .
.Pp
The user and group IDs for all files and directories are set to unknown,
and the permissions default to read, write and execute for user, group
and other.
.Pp
The arguments and options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s
Require that authentication credentials be sent securely to the server.
Note: If this option is not set, sending authentication credentials insecurely
to the server will be allowed but will be logged.
.It Fl S
Suppresses all user interface including the authentication dialogs and the
non-responsive ("disconnect") server dialogs. If the server connection becomes
non-responsive, the file system is immediately unmounted when this option has
been used.
.It Fl i
Interactive mode, you are prompted for the username and password.
.It Fl o
Options passed to
.Xr mount 2
are specified with the
.Fl o
option followed by a comma-separated string of options. See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings. If connecting to a
Class 1 compliant WebDAV server, the rdonly option will be set even if
it was not specified because mount_webdav will not allow files to be
opened with write access on servers which do not support the DAV LOCK
method.
.It Fl v Ar volume_name
Allows the volume_name attribute (ATTR_VOL_NAME) returned by
.Xr getattrlist 2
to be specified. If the volume_name is not specified, the last path
component name of the
.Ar node
path is used as the volume_name.
.It Ar [scheme://]host[:port][/path]
The WebDAV-enabled server directory (collection resource) to mount as a volume.
The scheme, if specified, must be "http://" or "https://". If the scheme is not
specified, then "http://" is used.
If the port is not specified, then port 80 is used when the scheme is "http://" or
port 443 is used when the scheme is "https://".
If the path is not specified, then the path "/" is used.
.It Ar node
Path to mount point. Note: The mount point directory must be created or exist before issuing the
.Nm
command.

The following example illustrates how to mount the WebDAV-enabled server
directory
.Pa http://idisk.mac.com/membername/
at the mount point
.Pa /Volumes/mntpnt/ .
Note: The mountpoint directory
.Pa /Volumes/mntpnt/
must be created before issuing the
.Nm
command.

Here is a list of common results (other error results not listed may be returned):
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It 0
.Nm
successfully mounted the server directory. 
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The server directory could not be mounted by
.Nm
because the node path is invalid.
.It Bq Er ENODEV
The server directory could not be mounted by
.Nm
because it is not WebDAV-enabled or because it does not exist, or
because node does not have proper access.
.It Bq Er ECANCELED
The server directory could not be mounted by
.Nm
because the user did not provide proper authentication credentials.

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
As noted above, the

future releases. Use the FSMountServerVolumeSync() and FSMountServerVolumeAsync()
APIs in CarbonCore/Files.h instead.

list the Postfix mail queue
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBshowq\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBshowq\fR(8) daemon reports the Postfix mail queue status.
The output is meant to be formatted by the postqueue(1) command,
as it emulates the Sendmail `mailq' command.

The \fBshowq\fR(8) daemon can also be run in stand\-alone mode
by the superuser. This mode of operation is used to emulate
the `mailq' command while the Postfix mail system is down.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBshowq\fR(8) daemon can run in a chroot jail at fixed low
privilege, and takes no input from the client. Its service port
is accessible to local untrusted users, so the service can be
susceptible to denial of service attacks.
.SH "STANDARDS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
None. The \fBshowq\fR(8) daemon does not interact with the
outside world.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"

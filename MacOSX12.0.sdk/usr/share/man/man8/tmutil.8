.Nm
provides methods of controlling and interacting with Time Machine, as well as examining and manipulating Time Machine backups. Common abilities include restoring data from backups, editing exclusions, and comparing backups.
.Pp
Several, but not all, verbs require root and Full Disk Access privileges. Full Disk Access privileges can be granted to the Terminal application used to run tmutil from the Privacy tab in the Security & Privacy preference pane.

.Ar arg
.br
Configure a local HFS+ or APFS volume, AFP share, or SMB share as a backup destination. Requires root and Full Disk Access privileges.
.Pp
When the
.Fl Sy a
option is provided,
.Ar arg
will be added to the list of destinations. Time Machine will automatically choose a backup destination from the list when performing backups. When the
.Fl Sy a
option is not provided, the current list of destinations will be replaced by
.Ar arg.
.Pp
If you wish to set an HFS+ or APFS volume as the backup destination,
.Ar arg
should be the mount point of the volume in question. When setting an AFP or SMB destination
.Ar arg
takes the form:
.Pp
.Pa protocol://user[:pass]@host/share
.Pp
In the AFP and SMB cases, the password component of the URL is optional; you may instead specify the
.Fl Sy p
option to enter the password at a non-echoing interactive prompt. This is of particular interest to the security-conscious, as all arguments provided to a program are visible by all users on the system via the

.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ADDEXCLUSION - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
.It Sy addexclusion Op Fl pv
.Ar item ...
.br
Configure an exclusion that tells Time Machine not to back up a file, directory, or volume during future backups.
.Pp
There are three kinds of user-configurable exclusions in Time Machine:
.Pp
The first kind of exclusion, which is the default behavior for the
.Sy addexclusion
verb, is a location-independent ("sticky") exclusion that follows a file or directory. When the file or directory is moved, the exclusion goes with the item to the new location. Additionally, when the item is copied, the copy retains the exclusion.
.Pp
The second kind of exclusion is a fixed-path exclusion. With this, you tell Time Machine that you want a specific path to be excluded, agnostic of the item at that path. If there is no file or directory at the specified path, the exclusion has no effect; if the item previously at the path has been moved or renamed, the item is not excluded, because it does not currently reside at the excluded path. As a consequence of these semantics, moving a file or directory
.Em to
the path will cause the item to be excluded--fixed-path exclusions are not automatically cleaned up when items are moved or deleted and will take effect again once an item exists at an excluded path.
.Pp
The third kind of exclusion is a volume exclusion. These track volumes based on file system UUID, which is persistent across volume name and mount path changes. Erasing the volume will cause Time Machine to apply default behavior for the newly erased volume.
.Pp
The
.Fl Sy p
option configures fixed-path exclusions. The
.Fl Sy v
option configures volume exclusions. Both require root and Full Disk Access privileges. The
.Fl Sy v
option is the only supported way to exclude or unexclude a volume; behavior is undefined if a sticky or fixed-path exclusion is specified.

.Pp
The

option provides a supported mechanism with which to trigger "automatic-like" backups, similar to automatic backups that are scheduled by the system. While this is not identical to true system-scheduled backups, it provides custom schedulers the ability to achieve some (but not all) behavior normally exhibited when operating in automatic mode.

, which is inside a backup, to the location

.Pp
When using the

verb,
.Nm
behaves largely like Finder. Custom Time Machine metadata (extended security and other) will be removed from the restored data, and other metadata will be preserved.
.Pp

Deletes the backups with the specified timestamp from the backup volume mounted at the specified mountpoint. The -t option followed by a timestamp can be used multiple times to specify multiple backups to delete. For HFS backup disks, a specific path to delete can also be specified using the -p option. This verb can delete items from backups that were not made by, or are not claimed by, the current machine. Requires root and Full Disk Access privileges.

represents things that only exist in the specified path; things that are present in other backups are not tallied.

.It Sy inheritbackup
.Ar {machine_directory | sparsebundle}
.br
Claim a machine directory or sparsebundle for use by the current machine. Requires root and Full Disk Access privileges.
.Pp
Machine directories and sparsebundles are owned by one computer at a time, and are tracked by unique identifiers rather than computer name, host name, or ethernet address. The
.Sy inheritbackup
verb reassigns the identity of the specified item, reconfiguring it so the current host recognizes it during backups. When inheriting a sparsebundle, the machine directory within will also be claimed.
.Pp
Inheriting is typically only one step in the process of configuring a backup for use by a machine. You may also need to use
.Sy setdestination Ns
,
.Sy associatedisk Ns
, or both, depending on the situation.
.Pp
One machine can own multiple machine directories and sparsebundles, but it is ill-advised for them to reside in the same place. In such a situation, which will be chosen during a backup is undefined. As a result,
.Sy inheritbackup
will attempt to detect possible identity collisions before making changes.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  ASSOCIATEDISK  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
.It Sy associatedisk
.Ar mount_point snapshot_volume
.br
Bind a volume store directory to the specified local disk, thereby reconfiguring the backup history. Requires root and Full Disk Access privileges.
.Pp
In Mac OS X, HFS+ and APFS volumes have a persistent UUID that is assigned when the file system is created. Time Machine uses this identifier to make an association between a source volume and a volume store. Erasing the source volume creates a new file system on the disk, and the previous UUID is not retained. The new UUID causes the source volume -> volume store association to be broken. If one were just erasing the volume and starting over, it would likely be of no real consequence, and the new UUID would not be a concern; when erasing a volume in order to clone another volume to it, recreating the association may be desired.
.Pp
A concrete example of when and how you would use
.Sy associatedisk Ns
:
.Pp
After having problems with a volume, you decide to erase it and manually restore its contents from a Time Machine backup or copy of another nature. (I.e., not via Time Machine System Restore or Migration Assistant.) On your next incremental backup, the data will be copied anew, as though none of it had been backed up before. Technically, it is true that the data has not been backed up, given the new UUID. However, this is probably not what you want Time Machine to do. You would then use
.Sy associatedisk
to reconfigure the backup so it appears that this volume has been backed up previously:
.Pp
thermopylae:~ thoth$ sudo tmutil associatedisk [-a] "/Volumes/MyNewStuffDisk" "/Volumes/Chronoton/Backups.backupdb/thermopylae/Latest/MyStuff"
.Pp
The result of the above command would associate the volume store
.Pa MyStuff
in the specified backup with the source volume
.Pa "MyNewStuffDisk" Ns
\&. The volume store would also be renamed to match. The
.Fl Sy a
option tells
.Sy associatedisk
to find all volume stores in the same machine directory that match the identity of
.Pa MyStuff Ns
, and then perform the association on all of them.

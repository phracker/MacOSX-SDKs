.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
configures a local user account to permit authentication using a supported 
SmartCard.  Authentication is via asymmetric key (also known as 
public-key) encryption.  
.Nm
works with signing keys, but not encryption keys.
.Pp
.Nm
can perform the following actions:
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Begins a tagged list
.It Ar pair
Associate a user with a public key. Because user's keychain will be modified to be unlockable by a key, SmartCard with that key must be present in the reader. The key to use has to be specified by its hash.
.It Ar unpair
Remove association with a user and keychain. If no specific hash is provided, all associations with a user are removed.
.It Ar pairing_ui
Enable, disable and force to display pairing dialog when card with unpaired identities is inserted
.It Ar identities
List all identities on all SmartCards and display appropriate associations with users (for associated keys) or key names (for unassociated keys).
.It Ar list
List all public keys associated with a user.
.It Ar changepin
Change or unblock SmartCard PIN.  This command works only for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) SmartCards. With -u argument, PIN can be unblocked using PUK and without the -u argument, PIN can be changed. Optional -t argument allows specifying tokenID.
.It Ar verifypin
Verify SmartCard PIN. This command works only for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) SmartCards. Optional -t argument allows specifying tokenID. Optional -p argument allows specifying PIN.
.It Ar enable_for_login
Enable the app extension for login and make the token available to the system for authentication.
.It Ar filevault
Manage SmartCard support for FileVault unlock.

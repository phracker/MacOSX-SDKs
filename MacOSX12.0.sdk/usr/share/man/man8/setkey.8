.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
adds, updates, dumps, or flushes
Security Association Database (SAD) entries
as well as Security Policy Database (SPD) entries in the kernel.
.Pp
.Nm
takes a series of operations from standard input
.Po
if invoked with
.Fl c
.Pc
or the file named
.Ar filename
.Po
if invoked with
.Fl f Ar filename
.Pc .
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It (no flag)
Dump the SAD entries or SPD entries contained in the specified
.Ar file .
.It Fl ?
Print short help.
.It Fl a
.Nm
usually does not display dead SAD entries with
.Fl D .
If
.Fl a
is also specified, the dead SAD entries will be displayed as well.
A dead SAD entry is one that has expired but remains in the
system because it is referenced by some SPD entries.
.It Fl D
Dump the SAD entries.
If
.Fl P
is also specified, the SPD entries are dumped.
If
.Fl p
is specified, the ports are displayed.
.It Fl F
Flush the SAD entries.
If
.Fl P
is also specified, the SPD entries are flushed.
.It Fl H
Add hexadecimal dump in
.Fl x
mode.
.It Fl h
On
.Nx ,
synonym for
.Fl H .
On other systems, synonym for
.Fl ? .
.It Fl k
Use semantics used in kernel.
Available only in Linux.
See also
.Fl r .
.It Fl l
Loop forever with short output on
.Fl D .
.It Fl n
No action.
The program will check validity of the input, but no changes to
the SPD will be made.
.It Fl r
Use semantics described in IPsec RFCs.
This mode is default.
For details see section
.Sx RFC vs Linux kernel semantics .
Available only in Linux.
See also
.Fl k .
.It Fl x
Loop forever and dump all the messages transmitted to the
.Dv PF_KEY
socket.
.Fl xx
prints the unformatted timestamps.
.It Fl V
Print version string.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
The program will dump messages exchanged on the
.Dv PF_KEY
socket, including messages sent from other processes to the kernel.

Meta-arguments are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width Ds
.It Ar src
.It Ar dst
Source/destination of the secure communication is specified as
an IPv4/v6 address, and an optional port number between square
brackets.
.Nm
can resolve a FQDN into numeric addresses.
If the FQDN resolves into multiple addresses,
.Nm
will install multiple SAD/SPD entries into the kernel
by trying all possible combinations.
.Fl 4 ,
.Fl 6 ,
and
.Fl n
restrict the address resolution of FQDN in certain ways.
.Fl 4
and
.Fl 6
restrict results into IPv4/v6 addresses only, respectively.
.Fl n
avoids FQDN resolution and requires addresses to be numeric addresses.
.\"
.Pp
.It Ar protocol
.Ar protocol
is one of following:
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact

.\"
.Pp
.It Ar spi
Security Parameter Index
.Pq SPI

.Ar spi
must be a decimal number, or a hexadecimal number with a
.Dq Li 0x
prefix.
SPI values between 0 and 255 are reserved for future use by IANA
and cannot be used.
TCP-MD5 associations must use 0x1000 and therefore only have per-host
granularity at this time.
.\"
.Pp
.It Ar extensions
take some of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact
.\"
.It Fl m Ar mode
Specify a security protocol mode for use.
.Ar mode
is one of following:
.Li transport , tunnel ,
or
.Li any .
The default value is
.Li any .
.\"
.It Fl r Ar size
Specify window size of bytes for replay prevention.
.Ar size
must be decimal number in 32-bit word.
If
.Ar size
is zero or not specified, replay checks don't take place.
.\"
.It Fl u Ar id
Specify the identifier of the policy entry in the SPD.
See
.Ar policy .
.\"
.It Fl f Ar pad_option
defines the content of the ESP padding.

Specify an encryption algorithm
.Ar ealgo
for ESP.
.It Xo
.Fl E Ar ealgo Ar key
.Fl A Ar aalgo Ar key
.Xc
Specify an encryption algorithm
.Ar ealgo ,
as well as a payload authentication algorithm
.Ar aalgo ,
for ESP.
.It Fl A Ar aalgo Ar key
Specify an authentication algorithm for AH.
.It Fl C Ar calgo Op Fl R
Specify a compression algorithm for IPComp.
If
.Fl R
is specified, the
.Ar spi
field value will be used as the IPComp CPI
.Pq compression parameter index
on wire as-is.
If
.Fl R
is not specified,
the kernel will use well-known CPI on wire, and
.Ar spi
field will be used only as an index for kernel internal usage.
.El
.Pp
.Ar key
must be a double-quoted character string, or a series of hexadecimal
digits preceded by
.Dq Li 0x .
.Pp
Possible values for
.Ar ealgo ,
.Ar aalgo ,
and
.Ar calgo
are specified in the
.Sx Algorithms
sections.
.\"
.Pp
.It Ar src_range
.It Ar dst_range
These select the communications that should be secured by IPsec.
They can be an IPv4/v6 address or an IPv4/v6 address range, and
may be accompanied by a TCP/UDP port specification.
This takes the following form:
.Bd -literal -offset
.Ar address
.Ar address/prefixlen
.Ar address[port]
.Ar address/prefixlen[port]
.Ed
.Pp
.Ar prefixlen
and
.Ar port
must be decimal numbers.
The square brackets around
.Ar port
are really necessary,
they are not man page meta-characters.
For FQDN resolution, the rules applicable to
.Ar src
and
.Ar dst
apply here as well.
.\"
.Pp
.It Ar upperspec
Upper-layer protocol to be used.
You can use one of the words in
.Pa /etc/protocols
as
.Ar upperspec ,
or
.Li icmp6 ,
.Li ip4 ,
or
.Li any .
.Li any
stands for
.Dq any protocol .
You can also use the protocol number.
You can specify a type and/or a code of ICMPv6 when the
upper-layer protocol is ICMPv6.
The specification can be placed after
.Li icmp6 .
A type is separated from a code by single comma.
A code must always be specified.
When a zero is specified, the kernel deals with it as a wildcard.
Note that the kernel can not distinguish a wildcard from an ICPMv6
type of zero.
For example, the following means that the policy doesn't require IPsec
for any inbound Neighbor Solicitation.
.Dl spdadd ::/0 ::/0 icmp6 135,0 -P in none ;
.Pp
.Em Note :
.Ar upperspec
does not work against forwarding case at this moment,
as it requires extra reassembly at the forwarding node
.Pq not implemented at this moment .
There are many protocols in
.Pa /etc/protocols ,
but all protocols except of TCP, UDP, and ICMP may not be suitable
to use with IPsec.
You have to consider carefully what to use.
.\"
.Pp
.It Ar policy
.Ar policy
is in one of the following three formats:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.It Fl P Ar direction [priority specification] Li discard
.It Fl P Ar direction [priority specification] Li none
.It Xo Fl P Ar direction [priority specification] Li ipsec
.Ar protocol/mode/src-dst/level Op ...
.Xc
.Ed
.Pp
You must specify the direction of its policy as
.Ar direction .
Either
.Ar out ,
.Ar in ,
or
.Ar fwd
can be used.
.Pp
.Ar priority specification
is used to control the placement of the policy within the SPD.
Policy position is determined by
a signed integer where higher priorities indicate the policy is placed
closer to the beginning of the list and lower priorities indicate the
policy is placed closer to the end of the list.
Policies with equal priorities are added at the end of groups
of such policies.
.Pp
Priority can only
be specified when setkey has been compiled against kernel headers that
support policy priorities (Linux \*[Gt]= 2.6.6).
If the kernel does not support priorities, a warning message will
be printed the first time a priority specification is used.
Policy priority takes one of the following formats:
.Bl -tag  -width "discard"
.It Xo
.Ar {priority,prio} offset
.Xc
.Ar offset
is an integer in the range from \-2147483647 to 214783648.
.It Xo
.Ar {priority,prio} base {+,\-} offset
.Xc
.Ar base
is either
.Li low (\-1073741824) ,
.Li def (0) ,
or
.Li high (1073741824)
.Pp
.Ar offset
is an unsigned integer.
It can be up to 1073741824 for
positive offsets, and up to 1073741823 for negative offsets.
.El
.Pp
.Li discard
means the packet matching indexes will be discarded.
.Li none
means that IPsec operation will not take place onto the packet.
.Li ipsec
means that IPsec operation will take place onto the packet.
.Pp
The
.Ar protocol/mode/src-dst/level
part specifies the rule how to process the packet.
Either
.Li ah ,
.Li esp ,
or
.Li ipcomp
must be used as
.Ar protocol .
.Ar mode
is either
.Li transport
or
.Li tunnel .
If
.Ar mode
is
.Li tunnel ,
you must specify the end-point addresses of the SA as
.Ar src
and
.Ar dst
with
.Sq -
between these addresses, which is used to specify the SA to use.
If
.Ar mode
is
.Li transport ,
both
.Ar src
and
.Ar dst
can be omitted.
.Ar level
is to be one of the following:
.Li default , use , require ,
or
.Li unique .
If the SA is not available in every level, the kernel will
ask the key exchange daemon to establish a suitable SA.
.Li default
means the kernel consults the system wide default for the protocol
you specified, e.g. the
.Li esp_trans_deflev
sysctl variable, when the kernel processes the packet.
.Li use
means that the kernel uses an SA if it's available,
otherwise the kernel keeps normal operation.
.Li require
means SA is required whenever the kernel sends a packet matched
with the policy.
.Li unique
is the same as
.Li require ;
in addition, it allows the policy to match the unique out-bound SA.
You just specify the policy level
.Li unique ,
.Xr racoon 8
will configure the SA for the policy.
If you configure the SA by manual keying for that policy,
you can put a decimal number as the policy identifier after
.Li unique
separated by a colon
.Sq \&:
like:
.Li unique:number
in order to bind this policy to the SA.
.Li number
must be between 1 and 32767.
It corresponds to
.Ar extensions Fl u
of the manual SA configuration.
When you want to use SA bundle, you can define multiple rules.
For example, if an IP header was followed by an AH header followed
by an ESP header followed by an upper layer protocol header, the
rule would be:
.Dl esp/transport//require ah/transport//require ;
The rule order is very important.
.Pp
When NAT-T is enabled in the kernel, policy matching for ESP over
UDP packets may be done on endpoint addresses and port
(this depends on the system.
System that do not perform the port check cannot support
multiple endpoints behind the same NAT).
When using ESP over UDP, you can specify port numbers in the endpoint
addresses to get the correct matching.
Here is an example:
.Bd -literal -offset
spdadd 10.0.11.0/24[any] 10.0.11.33/32[any] any -P out ipsec
    esp/tunnel/192.168.0.1[4500]-192.168.1.2[30000]/require ;

.Ed
These ports must be left unspecified (which defaults to 0) for
anything other than ESP over UDP.
They can be displayed in SPD dump using
.Nm
.Fl DPp .
.Pp
Note that
.Dq Li discard
and
.Dq Li none
are not in the syntax described in
.Xr ipsec_set_policy 3 .
There are a few differences in the syntax.
See
.Xr ipsec_set_policy 3
for detail.

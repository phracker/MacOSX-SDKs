.Sh NAME

.Nd convert an existing HFS file system to
.Tn APFS 
file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Op Fl e
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl i

.Op Fl F Ar index

.Ar <device-path>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command converts an existing HFS file system to a new
.Tn APFS
file system.
.Pp
It is recommended not to run the
.Nm
directly, but to run `diskutil apfs convert`.
.Pp
The
.Ar device-path
parameter should be the path to a disk device node, such as
.Pa /dev/disk1s2 ,  
with an existing HFS file system, 
which needs to be converted.
The
.Ar device-path
may be a path to a whole disk, such as
.Pa /dev/disk0 ,
which contains Lightweight Volume Manager (LwVM) structures; all HFS slices will
be converted and LwVM replaced by a GPT partition map with a single partition
containing the APFS container.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 20n
.It Fl e | Fl -estimate
Estimate the APFS metadata size after conversion.
.It Fl v | Fl -verbose
Increase verbosity of the output.
.It Fl s | Fl -force-case-sensitive
Force the converted volume to be case-sensitive.
By default, the converted volume will have the same case-sensitivity as the original HFS volume.
.It Fl S Ar path | Fl -stats Ar path
Print statistics about the conversion to the supplied
.Ar path .
If the path is
.Ar -
then the statistics are printed to standard output.
.It Fl n | Fl -dry-run
Do not finalize the conversion to APFS.
Volume remains HFS.
.It Fl f | Fl -force
Force conversion if volume is dirty (journal is non-empty, volume had inconsistencies, or volume is not journaled and not unmounted cleanly).
.It Fl F Ar index | Fl -fixed Ar index
Volume number
.Ar index
(0-based) should be formatted as fixed-size.
Usually used when converting LwVM.
.It Fl M Ar mount_path | Fl -mount-path Ar mount_path
When converting LwVM systems, which require a special "conversion mount" of the underlying device, use the given
.Ar mount_path
as the mount point.
If this option is not used, a temporary directory will be created and used.
.It Fl o Ar nx-apfs-format
NX or APFS format options.
.It Fl g
If conversion succeeds, modify the GPT UUID. 
.It Fl D | Fl -skip-single-dirlinks
Convert all former and current directory hardlinks to files/aliases. 
.It Fl -feature-format
Allow for one-off specific formatting features to be toggled on or off during the conversion to APFS.
Values must be specified in a CSV string.
For example
"feature=value,feature2=value2,..."
.Pp
.Cm dirents=unhashed
is a feature format flag that will specify to the converter that it should produce
a volume with legacy (non-standard) directory entries.
That is, the resulting volume will have file names that are both
normalization-sensitive and case-sensitive.
This is not recommended in most cases.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following converts the HFS file system
on the
.Pa /dev/disk1s2
device:
.Dl Nm Fl v Pa /dev/disk1s2

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in OS X 10.12.

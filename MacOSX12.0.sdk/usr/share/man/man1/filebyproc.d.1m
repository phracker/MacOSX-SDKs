.TH filebyproc.d 1m  "May 15, 2005" "version 1.00" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
filebyproc.d \- snoop opens by process name. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B filebyproc.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
filebyproc.d is a DTrace OneLiner to print file pathnames as they are
opened, including the name of the process calling the open.
A line will be printed regardless of whether the open is actually
successful or not.

This is useful to learn which files applications are attempting to
open, such as config files, database files, log files, etc.

Docs/oneliners.txt and Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt
in the DTraceToolkit contain this as a oneliner that can be cut-n-paste
to run.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

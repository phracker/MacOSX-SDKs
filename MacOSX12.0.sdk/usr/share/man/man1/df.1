.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm df
utility
displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the specified
.Ar filesystem
or on the filesystem of which
.Ar file
is a part.
Values are displayed in 512-byte per block counts.
If neither a file or a filesystem operand is specified,
statistics for all mounted filesystems are displayed
(subject to the
.Fl t
option below).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Show all mount points, including those that were mounted with the MNT_IGNORE
flag.
.It Fl b
Use (the default) 512-byte blocks.
This is only useful as a way to override an
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.It Fl g
Use 1073741824-byte (1-Gbyte) blocks rather than the default.
Note that this overrides the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.It Fl H
"Human-readable" output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to three or less using base 10 for sizes.
.It Fl h
"Human-readable" output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.
.It Fl i
Include statistics on the number of free inodes. This option is now the default to conform to
.St -susv3
Use
.Fl P
to suppress this output.
.It Fl k
Use 1024-byte (1-Kbyte) blocks, rather than the default.
Note that this overrides the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.It Fl l
Only display information about locally-mounted filesystems.
.It Fl m
Use 1048576-byte (1-Mbyte) blocks rather than the default.  Note that
this overrides the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.It Fl n
Print out the previously obtained statistics from the filesystems.
This option should be used if it is possible that one or more
filesystems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
statistics without a long delay.
When this option is specified,
.Nm df
will not request new statistics from the filesystems, but will respond
with the possibly stale statistics that were previously obtained.
.It Fl P
Use (the default) 512-byte blocks.
This is only useful as a way to override an
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.It Fl T
Only print out statistics for filesystems of the specified types.
More than one type may be specified in a comma separated list.
The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
.Dq no
to specify the filesystem types for which action should
.Em not
be taken.
For example, the
.Nm df
command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
df -T nonfs,mfs
.Ed
.Pp
lists all filesystems except those of type
.Tn NFS
and
.Tn MFS .
The
.Xr lsvfs 1
command can be used to find out the types of filesystems
that are available on the system.
.It Fl t
If used with no arguments,
this option is a no-op
(Mac OS X already prints the total allocated-space figures).
If used with an argument, it acts like
.Fl T ,
but this usage is deprecated and should not be relied upon.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environment variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, the block counts will be displayed in units of that size block.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl n
and
.Fl t
flags are ignored if a file or filesystem is specified.
.Sh LEGACY DESCRIPTION
The "capacity" percentage is normally rounded up to the next higher integer.
In legacy mode, it is rounded down to the next lower integer.
.Pp
When the
.Fl P
option and the
.Fl k
option are used together,
sizes are reported in 1024-blocks.
In legacy mode, when the
.Fl P
option and
.Fl k
option are used together,
the last option specified dictates the reported block size.
.Pp
The
.Fl t
option is normally a no-op
(Mac OS X already prints the total allocated-space figures).
In legacy mode, it is equivalent to
.Fl T .

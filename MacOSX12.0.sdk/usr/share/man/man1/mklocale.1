.Sh NAME
.Nm mklocale
.Nd make LC_CTYPE locale files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Ar "< src-file"
.Ar "> language/LC_CTYPE"
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Fl o
.Ar language/LC_CTYPE
.Ar src-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads a
.Dv LC_CTYPE
source file from standard input and produces a
.Dv LC_CTYPE
binary file on standard output suitable for placement in
.Pa /usr/share/locale/ Ns Ar language Ns Pa /LC_CTYPE .
.Pp
The format of
.Ar src-file
is quite simple.
It consists of a series of lines which start with a keyword and have
associated data following.
C style comments are used
to place comments in the file.
.Pp
Following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Turns on debugging messages.
.It Fl o
Specify output file.
.El
.Pp
Besides the keywords which will be listed below,
the following are valid tokens in
.Ar src-file :
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar literal"
.It Dv RUNE
A
.Dv RUNE
may be any of the following:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar 0x[0-9a-z]*"
.It Ar 'x'
The ASCII character
.Ar x .
.It Ar '\ex'
The ANSI C character
.Ar \ex
where
.Ar \ex
is one of
.Dv \ea ,
.Dv \eb ,
.Dv \ef ,
.Dv \en ,
.Dv \er ,
.Dv \et ,
or
.Dv \ev .
.It Ar 0x[0-9a-z]*
A hexadecimal number representing a rune code.
.It Ar 0[0-7]*
An octal number representing a rune code.
.It Ar [1-9][0-9]*
A decimal number representing a rune code.
.El
.It Dv STRING
A string enclosed in double quotes (").
.It Dv THRU
Either
.Dv ...
or
.Dv - .
Used to indicate ranges.
.It Ar literal
The follow characters are taken literally:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv <\|\|(\|\|["
.It Dv "<\|(\|["
Used to start a mapping.
All are equivalent.
.It Dv ">\|\^)\|]"
Used to end a mapping.
All are equivalent.
.It Dv :
Used as a delimiter in mappings.
.El
.El
.Pp
Key words which should only appear once are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv PHONOGRAM"
.It Dv ENCODING
Followed by a
.Dv STRING
which indicates the encoding mechanism to be used for this locale.
The current encodings are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv MSKanji"
.It Dv ASCII
American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
.It Dv BIG5
The
.Dq Big5
encoding of Chinese.
.It Dv EUC
.Dv EUC
encoding as used by several
vendors of
.Ux
systems.
.It Dv GB18030
PRC national standard for encoding of Chinese text.
.It Dv GB2312
Older PRC national standard for encoding Chinese text.
.It Dv GBK
A widely used encoding method for Chinese text,
backwards compatible with GB\ 2312-1980.
.It Dv MSKanji

loosely based on JIS.
Also known as
.Dq "Shift JIS"
and
.Dq SJIS .
.It Dv NONE
No translation and the default.
.It Dv UTF-8
The
.Dv UTF-8
transformation format of
.Tn ISO
10646
as defined by RFC 2279.
.El
.It Dv VARIABLE
This keyword must be followed by a single tab or space character,
after which encoding specific data is placed.
Currently only the
.Dv "EUC"
encoding requires variable data.
See
.Xr euc 5
for further details.
.It Dv INVALID
(obsolete)
A single
.Dv RUNE
follows and is used as the invalid rune for this locale.
.El
.Pp
The following keywords may appear multiple times and have the following
format for data:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv <RUNE1 THRU RUNEn : RUNE2>" -offset indent
.It Dv <RUNE1 RUNE2>
.Dv RUNE1
is mapped to
.Dv RUNE2 .
.It Dv <RUNE1 THRU RUNEn : RUNE2>
Runes
.Dv RUNE1
through
.Dv RUNEn
are mapped to
.Dv RUNE2
through
.Dv RUNE2
+ n-1.
.El
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv PHONOGRAM"
.It Dv MAPLOWER
Defines the tolower mappings.
.Dv RUNE2
is the lower case representation of
.Dv RUNE1 .
.It Dv MAPUPPER
Defines the toupper mappings.
.Dv RUNE2
is the upper case representation of
.Dv RUNE1 .
.It Dv TODIGIT
Defines a map from runes to their digit value.
.Dv RUNE2
is the integer value represented by
.Dv RUNE1 .
For example, the ASCII character
.Ql 0
would map to the decimal value 0.
Only values up to 255
are allowed.
.El
.Pp
The following keywords may appear multiple times and have the following
format for data:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv RUNE1 THRU RUNEn" -offset indent
.It Dv RUNE
This rune has the property defined by the keyword.
.It Dv "RUNE1 THRU RUNEn"

.Dv RUNE1
and
.Dv RUNEn
have the property defined by the keyword.

.Nm chgrp
.Nd change group
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chgrp
.Op Fl fhnv
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Ar group
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm chgrp
utility sets the group ID of the file named by each
.Ar file
operand to the
.Ar group
ID specified by the group operand.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors and doesn't
query about strange modes (unless the user does not have proper permissions).
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed).
.It Fl h
If the file is a symbolic link, the group ID of the link itself is changed
rather than the file that is pointed to.
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
This is the default. Use
.Fl h
to change the group ID of a symbolic link.
.It Fl R
Change the group ID for the file hierarchies rooted
in the files instead of just the files themselves.
.It Fl n
Interpret the group ID as numeric, avoiding the name lookup.
.It Fl v
Cause
.Nm chgrp
to be verbose, showing files as the group is modified.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
The
.Ar group
operand can be either a group name from the group database,
or a numeric group ID.
If a group name is also a numeric group ID, the operand is used as a
group name.
.Pp
The user invoking
.Nm chgrp
must belong to the specified group and be the owner of the file,
or be the super-user.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Ex -std
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
In previous versions of this system, symbolic links did not have groups.
.Pp
The
.Fl v
option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/group -compact
.It Pa /etc/group
group ID file
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chown 2 ,
.Xr fts 3 ,
.Xr group 5 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr symlink 7 ,
.Xr chown 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm chgrp
utility is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.

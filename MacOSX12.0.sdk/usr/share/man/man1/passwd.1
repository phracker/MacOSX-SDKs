.Sh NAME
.Nm passwd
.Nd modify a user's password
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm passwd
.Op Fl i Ar infosystem Op Fl l Ar location
.Op Fl u Ar authname
.Op Ar user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility changes the user's password.
If the user is not the super-user,
.Nm
first prompts for the current password and will not continue unless the correct
password is entered.
.Pp
When entering the new password, the characters entered do not echo, in order to
avoid the password being seen by a passer-by.
The
.Nm
utility prompts for the new password twice in order to detect typing errors.
.Pp
The new password should be at least six characters long
and not purely alphabetic.
Its total length should be less than
.Dv _PASSWORD_LEN
(currently 128 characters),
although some directory systems allow longer passwords.
Numbers, upper
case letters, and meta characters are encouraged.
.Pp
Once the password has been verified,
.Nm
communicates the new password to the directory system.

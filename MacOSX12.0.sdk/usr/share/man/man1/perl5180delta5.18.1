.SS "New mechanism for experimental features"
.IX Subsection "New mechanism for experimental features"
Newly-added experimental features will now require this incantation:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    no warnings "experimental::feature_name";
\&    use feature "feature_name";  # would warn without the prev line
.Ve
.PP
There is a new warnings category, called \*(L"experimental\*(R", containing
warnings that the feature pragma emits when enabling experimental
features.
.PP
Newly-added experimental features will also be given special warning IDs,
which consist of \*(L"experimental::\*(R" followed by the name of the feature.  (The
plan is to extend this mechanism eventually to all warnings, to allow them
to be enabled or disabled individually, and not just by category.)
.PP
By saying
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    no warnings "experimental::feature_name";
.Ve
.PP
you are taking responsibility for any breakage that future changes to, or
removal of, the feature may cause.
.PP
Since some features (like \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`my $_\*(C'\fR) now emit experimental warnings,
and you may want to disable them in code that is also run on perls that do not
recognize these warning categories, consider using the \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR pragma like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    no if $] >= 5.018, warnings => "experimental::feature_name";
.Ve
.PP
Existing experimental features may begin emitting these warnings, too.  Please
consult perlexperiment for information on which features are considered
experimental.
.SS "Hash overhaul"
.IX Subsection "Hash overhaul"
Changes to the implementation of hashes in perl v5.18.0 will be one of the most
visible changes to the behavior of existing code.
.PP
By default, two distinct hash variables with identical keys and values may now
provide their contents in a different order where it was previously identical.
.PP
When encountering these changes, the key to cleaning up from them is to accept
that \fBhashes are unordered collections\fR and to act accordingly.
.PP
\fIHash randomization\fR
.IX Subsection "Hash randomization"
.PP
The seed used by Perl's hash function is now random.  This means that the
order which keys/values will be returned from functions like \f(CW\*(C`keys()\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`values()\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`each()\*(C'\fR will differ from run to run.
.PP
This change was introduced to make Perl's hashes more robust to algorithmic
complexity attacks, and also because we discovered that it exposes hash
ordering dependency bugs and makes them easier to track down.
.PP
Toolchain maintainers might want to invest in additional infrastructure to
test for things like this.  Running tests several times in a row and then
comparing results will make it easier to spot hash order dependencies in
code.  Authors are strongly encouraged not to expose the key order of
Perl's hashes to insecure audiences.
.PP
Further, every hash has its own iteration order, which should make it much
more difficult to determine what the current hash seed is.
.PP
\fINew hash functions\fR
.IX Subsection "New hash functions"
.PP
Perl v5.18 includes support for multiple hash functions, and changed
the default (to \s-1ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD\s0), you can choose a different
algorithm by defining a symbol at compile time.  For a current list,
consult the \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR document.  Note that as of Perl v5.18 we can
only recommend use of the default or \s-1SIPHASH.\s0 All the others are
known to have security issues and are for research purposes only.
.PP
\fI\s-1PERL_HASH_SEED\s0 environment variable now takes a hex value\fR
.IX Subsection "PERL_HASH_SEED environment variable now takes a hex value"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_HASH_SEED\*(C'\fR no longer accepts an integer as a parameter;
instead the value is expected to be a binary value encoded in a hex
string, such as \*(L"0xf5867c55039dc724\*(R".  This is to make the
infrastructure support hash seeds of arbitrary lengths, which might
exceed that of an integer.  (SipHash uses a 16 byte seed.)
.PP
\fI\s-1PERL_PERTURB_KEYS\s0 environment variable added\fR
.IX Subsection "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS environment variable added"
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`PERL_PERTURB_KEYS\*(C'\fR environment variable allows one to control the level of
randomization applied to \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR and friends.
.PP
When \f(CW\*(C`PERL_PERTURB_KEYS\*(C'\fR is 0, perl will not randomize the key order at all. The
chance that \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR changes due to an insert will be the same as in previous
perls, basically only when the bucket size is changed.
.PP
When \f(CW\*(C`PERL_PERTURB_KEYS\*(C'\fR is 1, perl will randomize keys in a non-repeatable
way. The chance that \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR changes due to an insert will be very high.  This
is the most secure and default mode.
.PP
When \f(CW\*(C`PERL_PERTURB_KEYS\*(C'\fR is 2, perl will randomize keys in a repeatable way.
Repeated runs of the same program should produce the same output every time.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_HASH_SEED\*(C'\fR implies a non-default \f(CW\*(C`PERL_PERTURB_KEYS\*(C'\fR setting. Setting
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_HASH_SEED=0\*(C'\fR (exactly one 0) implies \f(CW\*(C`PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=0\*(C'\fR (hash key
randomization disabled); settng \f(CW\*(C`PERL_HASH_SEED\*(C'\fR to any other value implies
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=2\*(C'\fR (deterministic and repeatable hash key randomization).
Specifying \f(CW\*(C`PERL_PERTURB_KEYS\*(C'\fR explicitly to a different level overrides this
behavior.
.PP
\fI\fIHash::Util::hash_seed()\fI now returns a string\fR
.IX Subsection "Hash::Util::hash_seed() now returns a string"
.PP
\&\fIHash::Util::hash_seed()\fR now returns a string instead of an integer.  This
is to make the infrastructure support hash seeds of arbitrary lengths
which might exceed that of an integer.  (SipHash uses a 16 byte seed.)
.PP
\fIOutput of \s-1PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG\s0 has been changed\fR
.IX Subsection "Output of PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG has been changed"
.PP
The environment variable \s-1PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG\s0 now makes perl show both the
hash function perl was built with, \fIand\fR the seed, in hex, in use for that
process. Code parsing this output, should it exist, must change to accommodate
the new format.  Example of the new format:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG=1 ./perl \-e1
\&    HASH_FUNCTION = MURMUR3 HASH_SEED = 0x1476bb9f

.SS "Upgrade to Unicode 6.2"

6.1 is at <http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0>.
.SS "Character name aliases may now include non\-Latin1\-range characters"
.IX Subsection "Character name aliases may now include non-Latin1-range characters"
It is possible to define your own names for characters for use in
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{...}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`charnames::vianame()\*(C'\fR, etc.  These names can now be
comprised of characters from the whole Unicode range.  This allows for
names to be in your native language, and not just English.  Certain
restrictions apply to the characters that may be used (you can't define
a name that has punctuation in it, for example).  See \*(L"\s-1CUSTOM
ALIASES\*(R"\s0 in charnames.
.SS "New DTrace probes"
.IX Subsection "New DTrace probes"
The following new DTrace probes have been added:

\&\f(CW\*(C`op\-entry\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`loading\-file\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`loaded\-file\*(C'\fR
.ie n .SS """${^LAST_FH}"""
.el .SS "\f(CW${^LAST_FH}\fP"
.IX Subsection "${^LAST_FH}"

This is the handle used by \f(CW$.\fR and by \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eof\*(C'\fR without
arguments.
.SS "Regular Expression Set Operations"
.IX Subsection "Regular Expression Set Operations"
This is an \fBexperimental\fR feature to allow matching against the union,
intersection, etc., of sets of code points, similar to
Unicode::Regex::Set.  It can also be used to extend \f(CW\*(C`/x\*(C'\fR processing
to [bracketed] character classes, and as a replacement of user-defined
properties, allowing more complex expressions than they do.  See
\&\*(L"Extended Bracketed Character Classes\*(R" in perlrecharclass.
.SS "Lexical subroutines"
.IX Subsection "Lexical subroutines"
This new feature is still considered \fBexperimental\fR.  To enable it:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use 5.018;
\&    no warnings "experimental::lexical_subs";
\&    use feature "lexical_subs";
.Ve
.PP
You can now declare subroutines with \f(CW\*(C`state sub foo\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`my sub foo\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`our sub foo\*(C'\fR.  (\f(CW\*(C`state sub\*(C'\fR requires that the \*(L"state\*(R" feature be
enabled, unless you write it as \f(CW\*(C`CORE::state sub foo\*(C'\fR.)
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`state sub\*(C'\fR creates a subroutine visible within the lexical scope in which
it is declared.  The subroutine is shared between calls to the outer sub.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`my sub\*(C'\fR declares a lexical subroutine that is created each time the
enclosing block is entered.  \f(CW\*(C`state sub\*(C'\fR is generally slightly faster than
\&\f(CW\*(C`my sub\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`our sub\*(C'\fR declares a lexical alias to the package subroutine of the same
name.
.PP
For more information, see \*(L"Lexical Subroutines\*(R" in perlsub.
.SS "Computed Labels"
.IX Subsection "Computed Labels"
The loop controls \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`redo\*(C'\fR, and the special \f(CW\*(C`dump\*(C'\fR
operator, now allow arbitrary expressions to be used to compute labels at run
time.  Previously, any argument that was not a constant was treated as the
empty string.
.SS "More \s-1CORE::\s0 subs"
.IX Subsection "More CORE:: subs"
Several more built-in functions have been added as subroutines to the
\&\s-1CORE::\s0 namespace \- namely, those non-overridable keywords that can be
implemented without custom parsers: \f(CW\*(C`defined\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`delete\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`exists\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pos\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`protoytpe\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`scalar\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`study\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
As some of these have prototypes, \f(CW\*(C`prototype(\*(AqCORE::...\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR has been
changed to not make a distinction between overridable and non-overridable
keywords.  This is to make \f(CW\*(C`prototype(\*(AqCORE::pos\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR consistent with
\&\f(CW\*(C`prototype(&CORE::pos)\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS """kill"" with negative signal names"
.el .SS "\f(CWkill\fP with negative signal names"
.IX Subsection "kill with negative signal names"
\&\f(CW\*(C`kill\*(C'\fR has always allowed a negative signal number, which kills the
process group instead of a single process.  It has also allowed signal
names.  But it did not behave consistently, because negative signal names
were treated as 0.  Now negative signals names like \f(CW\*(C`\-INT\*(C'\fR are supported
and treated the same way as \-2 [perl #112990].
.SH "Security"

Some of the changes in the hash overhaul were made to
enhance security.  Please read that section.
.ie n .SS """Storable"" security warning in documentation"
.el .SS "\f(CWStorable\fP security warning in documentation"
.IX Subsection "Storable security warning in documentation"
The documentation for \f(CW\*(C`Storable\*(C'\fR now includes a section which warns readers
of the danger of accepting Storable documents from untrusted sources. The
short version is that deserializing certain types of data can lead to loading
modules and other code execution. This is documented behavior and wanted
behavior, but this opens an attack vector for malicious entities.
.ie n .SS """Locale::Maketext"" allowed code injection via a malicious template"
.el .SS "\f(CWLocale::Maketext\fP allowed code injection via a malicious template"
.IX Subsection "Locale::Maketext allowed code injection via a malicious template"
If users could provide a translation string to Locale::Maketext, this could be
used to invoke arbitrary Perl subroutines available in the current process.
.PP
This has been fixed, but it is still possible to invoke any method provided by
\&\f(CW\*(C`Locale::Maketext\*(C'\fR itself or a subclass that you are using. One of these
methods in turn will invoke the Perl core's \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR subroutine.
.PP
In summary, allowing users to provide translation strings without auditing
them is a bad idea.
.PP
This vulnerability is documented in \s-1CVE\-2012\-6329.\s0
.SS "Avoid calling memset with a negative count"
.IX Subsection "Avoid calling memset with a negative count"
Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify the count to perl's
\&\f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR string repeat operator can already cause a memory exhaustion
denial-of-service attack. A flaw in versions of perl before v5.15.5 can escalate
that into a heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions of glibc before 2.16, it
possibly allows the execution of arbitrary code.
.PP
The flaw addressed to this commit has been assigned identifier \s-1CVE\-2012\-5195\s0
and was researched by Tim Brown.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "See also: hash overhaul"
.IX Subsection "See also: hash overhaul"
Some of the changes in the hash overhaul are not fully
compatible with previous versions of perl.  Please read that section.
.ie n .SS "An unknown character name in ""\eN{...}"" is now a syntax error"
.el .SS "An unknown character name in \f(CW\eN{...}\fP is now a syntax error"
.IX Subsection "An unknown character name in N{...} is now a syntax error"
Previously, it warned, and the Unicode \s-1REPLACEMENT CHARACTER\s0 was
substituted.  Unicode now recommends that this situation be a syntax
error.  Also, the previous behavior led to some confusing warnings and
behaviors, and since the \s-1REPLACEMENT CHARACTER\s0 has no use other than as
a stand-in for some unknown character, any code that has this problem is
buggy.
.ie n .SS "Formerly deprecated characters in ""\eN{}"" character name aliases are now errors."
.el .SS "Formerly deprecated characters in \f(CW\eN{}\fP character name aliases are now errors."
.IX Subsection "Formerly deprecated characters in N{} character name aliases are now errors."
Since v5.12.0, it has been deprecated to use certain characters in
user-defined \f(CW\*(C`\eN{...}\*(C'\fR character names.  These now cause a syntax
error.  For example, it is now an error to begin a name with a digit,
such as in
.PP
.Vb 1
\& my $undraftable = "\eN{4F}";    # Syntax error!
.Ve
.PP
or to have commas anywhere in the name.  See \*(L"\s-1CUSTOM ALIASES\*(R"\s0 in charnames.
.ie n .SS """\eN{BELL}"" now refers to U+1F514 instead of U+0007"
.el .SS "\f(CW\eN{BELL}\fP now refers to U+1F514 instead of U+0007"
.IX Subsection "N{BELL} now refers to U+1F514 instead of U+0007"
Unicode 6.0 reused the name \*(L"\s-1BELL\*(R"\s0 for a different code point than it
traditionally had meant.  Since Perl v5.14, use of this name still
referred to U+0007, but would raise a deprecation warning.  Now, \*(L"\s-1BELL\*(R"\s0
refers to U+1F514, and the name for U+0007 is \*(L"\s-1ALERT\*(R". \s0 All the
functions in charnames have been correspondingly updated.
.SS "New Restrictions in Multi-Character Case-Insensitive Matching in Regular Expression Bracketed Character Classes"
.IX Subsection "New Restrictions in Multi-Character Case-Insensitive Matching in Regular Expression Bracketed Character Classes"
Unicode has now withdrawn their previous recommendation for regular
expressions to automatically handle cases where a single character can
match multiple characters case-insensitively, for example, the letter
\&\s-1LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S\s0 and the sequence \f(CW\*(C`ss\*(C'\fR.  This is because
it turns out to be impracticable to do this correctly in all
circumstances.  Because Perl has tried to do this as best it can, it
will continue to do so.  (We are considering an option to turn it off.)
However, a new restriction is being added on such matches when they
occur in [bracketed] character classes.  People were specifying
things such as \f(CW\*(C`/[\e0\-\exff]/i\*(C'\fR, and being surprised that it matches the
two character sequence \f(CW\*(C`ss\*(C'\fR (since \s-1LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S\s0 occurs in
this range).  This behavior is also inconsistent with using a
property instead of a range:  \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Block=Latin1}\*(C'\fR also includes \s-1LATIN
SMALL LETTER SHARP S,\s0 but \f(CW\*(C`/[\ep{Block=Latin1}]/i\*(C'\fR does not match \f(CW\*(C`ss\*(C'\fR.
The new rule is that for there to be a multi-character case-insensitive
match within a bracketed character class, the character must be
explicitly listed, and not as an end point of a range.  This more
closely obeys the Principle of Least Astonishment.  See
\&\*(L"Bracketed Character Classes\*(R" in perlrecharclass.  Note that a bug [perl
#89774], now fixed as part of this change, prevented the previous
behavior from working fully.
.SS "Explicit rules for variable names and identifiers"
.IX Subsection "Explicit rules for variable names and identifiers"
Due to an oversight, single character variable names in v5.16 were
completely unrestricted.  This opened the door to several kinds of
insanity.  As of v5.18, these now follow the rules of other identifiers,
in addition to accepting characters that match the \f(CW\*(C`\ep{POSIX_Punct}\*(C'\fR
property.
.PP
There is no longer any difference in the parsing of identifiers
specified by using braces versus without braces.  For instance, perl
used to allow \f(CW\*(C`${foo:bar}\*(C'\fR (with a single colon) but not \f(CW$foo:bar\fR.
Now that both are handled by a single code path, they are both treated
the same way: both are forbidden.  Note that this change is about the
range of permissible literal identifiers, not other expressions.
.SS "Vertical tabs are now whitespace"
.IX Subsection "Vertical tabs are now whitespace"
No one could recall why \f(CW\*(C`\es\*(C'\fR didn't match \f(CW\*(C`\ecK\*(C'\fR, the vertical tab.
Now it does.  Given the extreme rarity of that character, very little
breakage is expected.  That said, here's what it means:
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\es\*(C'\fR in a regex now matches a vertical tab in all circumstances.
.PP
Literal vertical tabs in a regex literal are ignored when the \f(CW\*(C`/x\*(C'\fR
modifier is used.
.PP
Leading vertical tabs, alone or mixed with other whitespace, are now
ignored when interpreting a string as a number.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $dec = " \ecK \et 123";
\&  $hex = " \ecK \et 0xF";
\&
\&  say 0 + $dec;   # was 0 with warning, now 123
\&  say int $dec;   # was 0, now 123
\&  say oct $hex;   # was 0, now  15

The implementation of this feature has been almost completely rewritten.

still uses lexical \f(CW$_\fR if there is lexical \f(CW$_\fR in scope (again, just like

.SS "The smartmatch family of features are now experimental"
.IX Subsection "The smartmatch family of features are now experimental"
Smart match, added in v5.10.0 and significantly revised in v5.10.1, has been
a regular point of complaint.  Although there are a number of ways in which
it is useful, it has also proven problematic and confusing for both users and
implementors of Perl.  There have been a number of proposals on how to best
address the problem.  It is clear that smartmatch is almost certainly either
going to change or go away in the future.  Relying on its current behavior
is not recommended.
.PP
Warnings will now be issued when the parser sees \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`given\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`when\*(C'\fR.
To disable these warnings, you can add this line to the appropriate scope:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  no if $] >= 5.018, warnings => "experimental::smartmatch";
.Ve
.PP
Consider, though, replacing the use of these features, as they may change
behavior again before becoming stable.
.ie n .SS "Lexical $_ is now experimental"
.el .SS "Lexical \f(CW$_\fP is now experimental"
.IX Subsection "Lexical $_ is now experimental"
Since it was introduced in Perl v5.10, it has caused much confusion with no
obvious solution:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Various modules (e.g., List::Util) expect callback routines to use the
global \f(CW$_\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`use List::Util \*(Aqfirst\*(Aq; my $_; first { $_ == 1 } @list\*(C'\fR
does not work as one would expect.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A \f(CW\*(C`my $_\*(C'\fR declaration earlier in the same file can cause confusing closure
warnings.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \*(L"_\*(R" subroutine prototype character allows called subroutines to access
your lexical \f(CW$_\fR, so it is not really private after all.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Nevertheless, subroutines with a \*(L"(@)\*(R" prototype and methods cannot access
the caller's lexical \f(CW$_\fR, unless they are written in \s-1XS.\s0
.IP "\(bu" 4
But even \s-1XS\s0 routines cannot access a lexical \f(CW$_\fR declared, not in the
calling subroutine, but in an outer scope, iff that subroutine happened not
to mention \f(CW$_\fR or use any operators that default to \f(CW$_\fR.
.PP
It is our hope that lexical \f(CW$_\fR can be rehabilitated, but this may
cause changes in its behavior.  Please use it with caution until it
becomes stable.

Previously, when reading from a stream with I/O layers such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`encoding\*(C'\fR, the \fIreadline()\fR function, otherwise known as the \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR
operator, would read \fIN\fR bytes from the top-most layer. [perl #79960]
.PP
Now, \fIN\fR characters are read instead.
.PP
There is no change in behaviour when reading from streams with no
extra layers, since bytes map exactly to characters.

the caller, see Devel::Callsite on \s-1CPAN.\s0

The body of a here document inside a quote-like operator now always begins

begin on the line following the containing quote-like operator, but that
was only sometimes the case [perl #114040].
.SS "Alphanumeric operators must now be separated from the closing delimiter of regular expressions"

with whitespace separating the operator from the closing delimiter of
the regular expression.  Not having whitespace has resulted in a
deprecation warning since Perl v5.14.0.
.SS "qw(...) can no longer be used as parentheses"
.IX Subsection "qw(...) can no longer be used as parentheses"
\&\f(CW\*(C`qw\*(C'\fR lists used to fool the parser into thinking they were always
surrounded by parentheses.  This permitted some surprising constructions
such as \f(CW\*(C`foreach $x qw(a b c) {...}\*(C'\fR, which should really be written
\&\f(CW\*(C`foreach $x (qw(a b c)) {...}\*(C'\fR.  These would sometimes get the lexer into
the wrong state, so they didn't fully work, and the similar \f(CW\*(C`foreach qw(a
b c) {...}\*(C'\fR that one might expect to be permitted never worked at all.
.PP
This side effect of \f(CW\*(C`qw\*(C'\fR has now been abolished.  It has been deprecated
since Perl v5.13.11.  It is now necessary to use real parentheses
everywhere that the grammar calls for them.

categories are left on when turning on lexical warnings (unless they are
turned off by \f(CW\*(C`no warnings\*(C'\fR, of course).
.PP
This may cause deprecation warnings to occur in code that used to be free
of warnings.
.PP
Those are the only categories consisting only of default warnings.  Default

A value stored in an environment variable has always been stringified.  In this

.SS "Certain rare uses of backslashes within regexes are now deprecated"

There are three pairs of characters that Perl recognizes as
metacharacters in regular expression patterns: \f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[]\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`()\*(C'\fR.
These can be used as well to delimit patterns, as in:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  m{foo}
\&  s(foo)(bar)
.Ve
.PP
Since they are metacharacters, they have special meaning to regular
expression patterns, and it turns out that you can't turn off that
special meaning by the normal means of preceding them with a backslash,
if you use them, paired, within a pattern delimited by them.  For
example, in
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  m{foo\e{1,3\e}}
.Ve
.PP
the backslashes do not change the behavior, and this matches
\&\f(CW"f\ o"\fR followed by one to three more occurrences of \f(CW"o"\fR.
.PP
Usages like this, where they are interpreted as metacharacters, are
exceedingly rare; we think there are none, for example, in all of \s-1CPAN.\s0
Hence, this deprecation should affect very little code.  It does give
notice, however, that any such code needs to change, which will in turn
allow us to change the behavior in future Perl versions so that the
backslashes do have an effect, and without fear that we are silently
breaking any existing code.

A new C preprocessor define \f(CW\*(C`NO_TAINT_SUPPORT\*(C'\fR was added that, if set,

The overrides for \f(CW\*(C`hex\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`oct\*(C'\fR have been rewritten, eliminating

.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Formerly, whichever of \f(CW\*(C`use bigint\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`use bigrat\*(C'\fR was compiled later
would take precedence over the other, causing \f(CW\*(C`hex\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`oct\*(C'\fR not to
respect the other pragma when in scope.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Using any of these three pragmata would cause \f(CW\*(C`hex\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`oct\*(C'\fR anywhere
else in the program to evalute their arguments in list context and prevent
them from inferring \f(CW$_\fR when called without arguments.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Using any of these three pragmata would make \f(CW\*(C`oct("1234")\*(C'\fR return 1234

is translated from octal to decimal, whether within the pragma's scope or
not.

File::Glob has had exactly the same fix as File::DosGlob.  Since it is

\&\f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR now works, and does not return false for pipes [perl #111638].
.Sp
Previously \f(CW\*(C`File::stat\*(C'\fR's overloaded \f(CW\*(C`\-x\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-X\*(C'\fR operators did not give
the correct results for directories or executable files when running as

any other user, performing group membership tests \fIetc\fR for files not owned
by root. They now follow the correct Unix behaviour \- for a directory they
are always true, and for a file if any of the three execute permission bits

Subroutine \*(L"&%s\*(R" is not available
.Sp
(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently
available.  This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the lexical
subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not
yet been created.  (Remember that named subs are created at compile time,
while anonymous subs are created at run-time.)  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \e&a } }
.Ve
.Sp
At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current the \*(L"a\*(R" sub,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely, the
following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now
been created and is live:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub { my sub a {...} eval \*(Aqsub f { \e&a }\*(Aq }\->();
.Ve
.Sp
The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    sub f {
\&        my sub a {...}
\&        sub { eval \*(Aq\e&a\*(Aq }
\&    }
\&    f()\->();
.Ve
.Sp
Here, when the '\e&a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently
being executed, so its &a is not available for capture.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\*(L"%s\*(R" subroutine &%s masks earlier declaration in same \f(CW%s\fR
.Sp
(W misc) A \*(L"my\*(R" or \*(L"state\*(R" subroutine has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to
the previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.
Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of
the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.

$* is no longer supported
.Sp
The warning that use of \f(CW$*\fR and \f(CW$#\fR is no longer supported is now

to be generated if another variable using the same typeglob was seen first
(e.g. \f(CW\*(C`@*\*(C'\fR before \f(CW$*\fR), and would not be generated for the second and
subsequent uses.  (It's hard to fix the failure to generate warnings at all

consistent with the warnings that \f(CW$[\fR used to generate.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
The warnings for \f(CW\*(C`\eb{\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eB{\*(C'\fR were added.  They are a deprecation

false positives.  Lexical \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR are no longer disallowed if they are

This feature was requested by Tim Bunce, who observed that
\&\f(CW\*(C`INSTALL_BASE\*(C'\fR creates a library structure that does not

.Sp

Perl has a new copy-on-write mechanism that allows any SvPOK scalar to be
upgraded to a copy-on-write scalar.  A reference count on the string buffer
is stored in the string buffer itself.  This feature is \fBnot enabled by
default\fR.
.Sp
It can be enabled in a perl build by running \fIConfigure\fR with
\&\fB\-Accflags=\-DPERL_NEW_COPY_ON_WRITE\fR, and we would encourage \s-1XS\s0 authors
to try their code with such an enabled perl, and provide feedback.
Unfortunately, there is not yet a good guide to updating \s-1XS\s0 code to cope
with \s-1COW. \s0 Until such a document is available, consult the perl5\-porters

The implementation of code blocks in regular expressions, such as \f(CW\*(C`(?{})\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`(??{})\*(C'\fR, has been heavily reworked to eliminate a whole slew of bugs.
The main user-visible changes are:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Code blocks within patterns are now parsed in the same pass as the
surrounding code; in particular it is no longer necessary to have balanced
braces: this now works:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    /(?{  $x=\*(Aq{\*(Aq  })/
.Ve
.Sp
This means that this error message is no longer generated:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Sequence (?{...}) not terminated or not {}\-balanced in regex
.Ve
.Sp
but a new error may be seen:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Sequence (?{...}) not terminated with \*(Aq)\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
In addition, literal code blocks within run-time patterns are only
compiled once, at perl compile-time:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    for my $p (...) {
\&        # this \*(AqFOO\*(Aq block of code is compiled once,
\&        # at the same time as the surrounding \*(Aqfor\*(Aq loop
\&        /$p{(?{FOO;})/;
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Lexical variables are now sane as regards scope, recursion and closure
behavior. In particular, \f(CW\*(C`/A(?{B})C/\*(C'\fR behaves (from a closure viewpoint)
exactly like \f(CW\*(C`/A/ && do { B } && /C/\*(C'\fR, while  \f(CW\*(C`qr/A(?{B})C/\*(C'\fR is like
\&\f(CW\*(C`sub {/A/ && do { B } && /C/}\*(C'\fR. So this code now works how you might
expect, creating three regexes that match 0, 1, and 2:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    for my $i (0..2) {
\&        push @r, qr/^(??{$i})$/;
\&    }
\&    "1" =~ $r[1]; # matches
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`use re \*(Aqeval\*(Aq\*(C'\fR pragma is now only required for code blocks defined
at runtime; in particular in the following, the text of the \f(CW$r\fR pattern is
still interpolated into the new pattern and recompiled, but the individual
compiled code-blocks within \f(CW$r\fR are reused rather than being recompiled,
and \f(CW\*(C`use re \*(Aqeval\*(Aq\*(C'\fR isn't needed any more:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $r = qr/abc(?{....})def/;
\&    /xyz$r/;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Flow control operators no longer crash. Each code block runs in a new
dynamic scope, so \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR etc. will not see
any enclosing loops. \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR returns a value
from the code block, not from any enclosing subroutine.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl normally caches the compilation of run-time patterns, and doesn't
recompile if the pattern hasn't changed, but this is now disabled if
required for the correct behavior of closures. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    my $code = \*(Aq(??{$x})\*(Aq;
\&    for my $x (1..3) {
\&        # recompile to see fresh value of $x each time
\&        $x =~ /$code/;
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`/msix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`(?msix)\*(C'\fR etc. flags are now propagated into the return
value from \f(CW\*(C`(??{})\*(C'\fR; this now works:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    "AB" =~ /a(??{\*(Aqb\*(Aq})/i;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Warnings and errors will appear to come from the surrounding code (or for
run-time code blocks, from an eval) rather than from an \f(CW\*(C`re_eval\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use re \*(Aqeval\*(Aq; $c = \*(Aq(?{ warn "foo" })\*(Aq; /$c/;
\&    /(?{ warn "foo" })/;
.Ve
.Sp
formerly gave:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    foo at (re_eval 1) line 1.
\&    foo at (re_eval 2) line 1.
.Ve
.Sp
and now gives:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    foo at (eval 1) line 1.
\&    foo at /some/prog line 2.

perl v5.10.0, if the format referenced lexical variables from the outer sub.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Using a \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR defined inside a closure, which format references
lexical variables from outside, never really worked unless the \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR
call was directly inside the closure.  In v5.10.0 it even started crashing.
Now the copy of that closure nearest the top of the call stack is used to
find those variables.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Formats that close over variables in special blocks no longer crash if a
stub exists with the same name as the special block before the special
block is compiled.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The parser no longer gets confused, treating \f(CW\*(C`eval foo ()\*(C'\fR as a syntax
error if preceded by \f(CW\*(C`print;\*(C'\fR [perl #16249].
.IP "\(bu" 4
The return value of \f(CW\*(C`syscall\*(C'\fR is no longer truncated on 64\-bit platforms
[perl #113980].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Constant folding no longer causes \f(CW\*(C`print 1 ? FOO : BAR\*(C'\fR to print to the
\&\s-1FOO\s0 handle [perl #78064].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`do subname\*(C'\fR now calls the named subroutine and uses the file name it
returns, instead of opening a file named \*(L"subname\*(R".
.IP "\(bu" 4
Subroutines looked up by rv2cv check hooks (registered by \s-1XS\s0 modules) are
now taken into consideration when determining whether \f(CW\*(C`foo bar\*(C'\fR should be
the sub call \f(CW\*(C`foo(bar)\*(C'\fR or the method call \f(CW\*(C`"bar"\->foo\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`CORE::foo::bar\*(C'\fR is no longer treated specially, allowing global overrides
to be called directly via \f(CW\*(C`CORE::GLOBAL::uc(...)\*(C'\fR [perl #113016].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Calling an undefined sub whose typeglob has been undefined now produces the
customary \*(L"Undefined subroutine called\*(R" error, instead of \*(L"Not a \s-1CODE\s0
reference\*(R".
.IP "\(bu" 4
Two bugs involving \f(CW@ISA\fR have been fixed.  \f(CW\*(C`*ISA = *glob_without_array\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef *ISA; @{*ISA}\*(C'\fR would prevent future modifications to \f(CW@ISA\fR from
updating the internal caches used to look up methods.  The
*glob_without_array case was a regression from Perl v5.12.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Regular expression optimisations sometimes caused \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR to
produce failed or incorrect matches [perl #114068].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_SUB_\|_\*(C'\fR now works in a \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR block when the enclosing subroutine is
predeclared with \f(CW\*(C`sub foo;\*(C'\fR syntax [perl #113710].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Unicode properties only apply to Unicode code points, which leads to
some subtleties when regular expressions are matched against
above-Unicode code points.  There is a warning generated to draw your
attention to this.  However, this warning was being generated
inappropriately in some cases, such as when a program was being parsed.
Non-Unicode matches such as \f(CW\*(C`\ew\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[:word:]\*(C'\fR should not generate the
warning, as their definitions don't limit them to apply to only Unicode
code points.  Now the message is only generated when matching against
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eP{}\*(C'\fR.  There remains a bug, [perl #114148], for the very
few properties in Unicode that match just a single code point.  The
warning is not generated if they are matched against an above-Unicode
code point.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Uninitialized warnings mentioning hash elements would only mention the
element name if it was not in the first bucket of the hash, due to an
off-by-one error.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A regular expression optimizer bug could cause multiline \*(L"^\*(R" to behave
incorrectly in the presence of line breaks, such that
\&\f(CW\*(C`"/\en\en" =~ m#\eA(?:^/$)#im\*(C'\fR would not match [perl #115242].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Failed \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR in list context no longer corrupts the stack.
\&\f(CW\*(C`@a = (1, 2, fork, 3)\*(C'\fR used to gobble up the 2 and assign \f(CW\*(C`(1, undef, 3)\*(C'\fR
if the \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR call failed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Numerous memory leaks have been fixed, mostly involving tied variables that
die, regular expression character classes and code blocks, and syntax
errors.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning a regular expression (\f(CW\*(C`${qr//}\*(C'\fR) to a variable that happens to
hold a floating point number no longer causes assertion failures on
debugging builds.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning a regular expression to a scalar containing a number no longer
causes subsequent numification to produce random numbers.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning a regular expression to a magic variable no longer wipes away the
magic.  This was a regression from v5.10.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning a regular expression to a blessed scalar no longer results in
crashes.  This was also a regression from v5.10.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Regular expression can now be assigned to tied hash and array elements with
flattening into strings.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Numifying a regular expression no longer results in an uninitialized
warning.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Negative array indices no longer cause \s-1EXISTS\s0 methods of tied variables to
be ignored.  This was a regression from v5.12.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Negative array indices no longer result in crashes on arrays tied to
non-objects.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$byte_overload .= $utf8\*(C'\fR no longer results in doubly-encoded \s-1UTF\-8\s0 if the
left-hand scalar happened to have produced a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 string the last time
overloading was invoked.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`goto &sub\*(C'\fR now uses the current value of \f(CW@_\fR, instead of using the array
the subroutine was originally called with.  This means
\&\f(CW\*(C`local @_ = (...); goto &sub\*(C'\fR now works [perl #43077].
.IP "\(bu" 4
If a debugger is invoked recursively, it no longer stomps on its own
lexical variables.  Formerly under recursion all calls would share the same
set of lexical variables [perl #115742].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW*_{ARRAY}\fR returned from a subroutine no longer spontaneously
becomes empty.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When using \f(CW\*(C`say\*(C'\fR to print to a tied filehandle, the value of \f(CW\*(C`$\e\*(C'\fR is
correctly localized, even if it was previously undef.  [perl #119927]

UTF8\-flagged strings in \f(CW%ENV\fR on HP-UX 11.00 are buggy

The interaction of UTF8\-flagged strings and \f(CW%ENV\fR on HP-UX 11.00 is
currently dodgy in some not-yet-fully-diagnosed way.  Expect test

Hojung Yoon (\s-1AMORETTE\s0), 24, of Seoul, South Korea, went to his long rest
on May 8, 2013 with llama figurine and autographed \s-1TIMTOADY\s0 card.  He
was a brilliant young Perl 5 & 6 hacker and a devoted member of
Seoul.pm.  He programmed Perl, talked Perl, ate Perl, and loved Perl.  We
believe that he is still programming in Perl with his broken \s-1IBM\s0 laptop
somewhere.  He will be missed.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
\&\s-1CPAN.\s0

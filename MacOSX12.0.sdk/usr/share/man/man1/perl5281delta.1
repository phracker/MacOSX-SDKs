This document describes differences between the 5.28.0 release and the 5.28.1
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.0, first read
perl5280delta, which describes differences between 5.26.0 and 5.28.0.

.IX Subsection "[CVE-2018-18311] Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow and segmentation fault"
Integer arithmetic in \f(CW\*(C`Perl_my_setenv()\*(C'\fR could wrap when the combined length
of the environment variable name and value exceeded around 0x7fffffff.  This
could lead to writing beyond the end of an allocated buffer with attacker
supplied data.

Perl 5.28 introduced an \f(CW\*(C`index()\*(C'\fR optimization when comparing to \-1 (or
indirectly, e.g. >= 0).  When this optimization was triggered inside a \f(CW\*(C`when\*(C'\fR
clause it caused a warning (\*(L"Argument \f(CW%s\fR isn't numeric in smart match\*(R").  This
has now been fixed.
[perl #133368] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133368>
.IP "\(bu" 4
Matching of decimal digits in script runs, introduced in Perl 5.28, had a bug
that led to \f(CW"1\eN{THAI DIGIT FIVE}"\fR matching \f(CW\*(C`/^(*sr:\ed+)$/\*(C'\fR when it should
not.  This has now been fixed.

The new in-place editing code no longer leaks directory handles.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history.  In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0 community for
helping Perl to flourish.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
\&\*(L"\s-1SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\*(R"\s0 in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.
.SH "Give Thanks"

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the \f(CW\*(C`perlthanks\*(C'\fR program:

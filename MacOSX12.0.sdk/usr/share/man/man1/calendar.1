.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility checks the current directory for a file named
.Pa calendar
and displays lines that begin with either today's date
or tomorrow's.
On the day before a weekend (normally Friday), events for the next
three days are displayed.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A Ar num
Print lines from today and the next
.Ar num
days (forward, future).
.It Fl a
Process the ``calendar'' files of all users and mail the results
to them.
This requires super-user privileges.
.It Fl B Ar num
Print lines from today and the previous
.Ar num
days (backward, past).
.It Fl F Ar friday
Specify which day of the week is ``Friday'' (the day before the
weekend begins).
Default is 5.
.It Fl f Pa calendarfile
Use
.Pa calendarfile
as the default calendar file.
.It Xo Fl t
.Sm off
.Ar dd
.Op . Ar mm Op . Ar year
.Sm on
.Xc
For test purposes only: set date directly to argument values.
.It Fl W Ar num
Print lines from today and the next
.Ar num
days (forward, future).
Ignore weekends when calculating the number of days.
.El
.Pp
To handle calendars in your national code table you can specify
.Dq LANG=<locale_name>
in the calendar file as early as possible.
To handle national Easter
names in the calendars
.Dq Easter=<national_name>
(for Catholic Easter) or
.Dq Paskha=<national_name>
(for Orthodox Easter) can be used.
.Pp
Other lines should begin with a month and day.
They may be entered in almost any format, either numeric or as character
strings.
If the proper locale is set, national month and weekday
names can be used.
A single asterisk (``*'') matches every month.
A day without a month matches that day of every week.
A month without a day matches the first of that month.
Two numbers default to the month followed by the day.
Lines with leading tabs default to the last entered date, allowing
multiple line specifications for a single date.
.Pp
``Easter'', is Easter for this year, and may be followed by a positive
or negative integer.
.Pp
``Paskha'', is Orthodox Easter for this year, and may be followed by a
positive or negative integer.
.Pp
Weekdays may be followed by ``-4'' ...\& ``+5'' (aliases for
last, first, second, third, fourth) for moving events like
``the last Monday in April''.
.Pp
By convention, dates followed by an asterisk are not fixed, i.e., change
from year to year.
.Pp
Day descriptions start after the first <tab> character in the line;
if the line does not contain a <tab> character, it is not displayed.
If the first character in the line is a <tab> character, it is treated as
a continuation of the previous line.
.Pp
The ``calendar'' file is preprocessed by
.Xr cpp 1 ,
allowing the inclusion of shared files such as lists of company holidays or
meetings.
If the shared file is not referenced by a full pathname,
.Xr cpp 1
searches in the current (or home) directory first, and then in the
directory
.Pa /usr/share/calendar .
Empty lines and lines protected by the C commenting syntax
.Pq Li /* ... */
are ignored.
.Pp

\fB\et\fR sequence)

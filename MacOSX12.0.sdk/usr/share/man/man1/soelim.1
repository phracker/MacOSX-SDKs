.TH SOELIM 1 "6 August 2004" "Groff Version 1.19.2"
.
.SH NAME
soelim \- interpret .so requests in groff input
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B soelim
[
.B \-Crtv
]
[
.BI \-I dir
]
[
.IR files \|.\|.\|.\|
]
.
.PP
It is possible to have whitespace between the
.B \-I
command line option and its parameter.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B soelim
reads
.I files
and replaces lines of the form
.IP
.BI .so\  file
.LP
by the contents of
.IR file .
It is useful if files included with
.B so
need to be preprocessed.
Normally,
.B soelim
should be invoked with the
.B \-s
option of
.BR groff .
.
.PP
Note that there must be no whitespace between the leading dot and
the two characters `s' and `o'.  Otherwise, only
.B groff
interprets the
.B .so
request (and
.B soelim
ignores it).
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-C
Recognize
.B .so
even when followed by a character other than space or newline.
.
.TP
.BI \-I dir
This option may be used to specify a directory to search for
files (both those on the command line and those named in
.B \&.so
requests).
The current directory is always searched first.
This option may be specified more than once,
the directories will be searched in the order specified.
No directory search is performed for files specified using an absolute path.
.
.TP
.B \-r
Do not add .lf requests (for general use, with non-groff files).
.
.TP
.B \-t
Don't emit .lf requests but TeX comment lines (starting with `%') giving
the current file and line number.
.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.
.SH USAGE
The normal processing sequence of groff is this:
.
.PP
.ie t \{\
.PS
box invisible width 0.5 height 0.4 "input" "file";
move to last box .bottom;
down;
arrow 0.3;
box invisible width 0.8 height 0.2 "preprocessor";
move to last box .right
right;
arrow 0.3;
A: box invisible width 0.35 height 0.2 "troff";
move to last box .top;
up;
move 0.3;
box invisible width 0.6 height 0.4 "sourced" "file";
line <- up 0.3 from A.top;
move to A.right;
right;
arrow 0.3;
box invisible width 0.85 height 0.2 "postprocessor";
move to last box .bottom;
down;
arrow 0.3;
box invisible width 0.5 height 0.4 "output" "file"
.PE
.\}
.el \{\
.nf
          input        sourced
          file          file
            |             |
            v             v
        preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                                      |
                                      v
                                   output
                                    file
.fi
.\}
.PP
.
That is, files sourced with
.B .so
are normally read
.I only
by
.B troff
(the actual formatter).
.B soelim
is
.I not
required for
.B troff
to source files.
.
.PP
If a file to be sourced should also be preprocessed, it must
already be read
.I before
the input file passes through the preprocessor.
This is handled by
.BR soelim :
.
.PP
.ie t \{\
.PS
box invisible width 0.5 height 0.4 "input" "file";
move to last box .bottom;
down;
arrow 0.3;
A: box invisible width 0.5 height 0.2 "soelim";
line <- 0.3;
box invisible width 0.5 height 0.4 "sourced" "file";
move to A.right;
right;
arrow 0.3;
box invisible width 0.8 height 0.2 "preprocessor";
arrow 0.3;
box invisible width 0.35 height 0.2 "troff";
arrow 0.3
box invisible width 0.85 height 0.2 "postprocessor";
move to last box .bottom;
down;
arrow 0.3;
box invisible width 0.5 height 0.4 "output" "file"

.el \{\

          file
            |
            v
          soelim -> preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
            ^                                     |
            |                                     v
         sourced                               output
          file                                  file

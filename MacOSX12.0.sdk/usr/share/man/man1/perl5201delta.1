certain non-Perl libraries called from \s-1XS,\s0 such as \f(CW\*(C`Gtk\*(C'\fR do so.  When this

\&\f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR and friends should now work properly on more Android builds.
.Sp
Due to an oversight, the value specified through \fB\-Dtargetsh\fR to \fIConfigure\fR

cross-compiled for Android to end up with defective versions of \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR and backticks: the commands would end up looking for \fI/bin/sh\fR instead
of \fI/system/bin/sh\fR, and so would fail for the vast majority of devices,
leaving \f(CW$!\fR as \f(CW\*(C`ENOENT\*(C'\fR.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ ,
the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on

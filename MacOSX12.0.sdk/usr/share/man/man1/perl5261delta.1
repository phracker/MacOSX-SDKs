Several built-in functions previously had bugs that could cause them to write
to the internal stack without allocating room for the item being written.  In
rare situations, this could have led to a crash.  These bugs have now been
fixed, and if any similar bugs are introduced in future, they will be detected
automatically in debugging builds.

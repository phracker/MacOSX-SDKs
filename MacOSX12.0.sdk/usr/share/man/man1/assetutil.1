.Nm 
processes a .car file generated from a image catalog removing
requested scale factors, device idioms, subtypes, performance and
memory classes. When thinning scale, idiom, subtype, performance,
memory, and graphicsclassfallbacks can be given multiple times, the
resulting file will contain all of the assets that match all of the
parameters given. If scale, idiom, subtype and graphics class are
given in one set, the same parameters must all be present in the
subsequent set of parmeters. (IE the count must match)

.It Fl I
Produce a JSON description of the asset catalog object with the given name to
--output directory if given or to stdout if no output path given. If no name is provided,
report on the contents of the entire car file.
.It Fl i                 \"-i flag as a list item
Keep all assets that have idiom that is given on the command
line.
.It Fl s                 \"-s flag as a list item
Keep all assets that have scale factor that is given on the command
line, present scale factors will not be removed if there is no
fallback available.
.It Fl p
Keep all assets that have the display gamut that is given on the
command line, present display gamuts  will not be removed if there is no
fall back available.
.It Fl M                 \"-M flag as a list item
Keep all assets that have memory class that is given on the command
line, present memory class will not be removed if there is no fallback available.
.It Fl g                 \"-g flag as a list item
Keep all assets that have graphics class that is given on the command
line. The present graphics class will not be removed if there is no fallback available.
.It Fl h
process the hosted idioms list, this is a list of the idioms that must
always be preserved in the car file. This list cannot contain
universal, and the different idioms should be given in a comma separated list.
.It Fl i
Idiom to keep. Can be one of universal/phone/pad. 
.It Fl t
Subtype to keep (integer)
.It Fl c
Main Assets.car file used to supply the names of the assets to the -I
(--info) and the dump options -d (--dump) and -D (--dump-stack).
.It Fl o
Output file name, if no output file is given then input file is
overwritten.
.It Fl T
compare thinning attributes
\'scale=2:idiom=phone:memory=2:graphicsclass=MTL1,2/scale=2:idiom=phone:memory=1:graphicsclass=MTL2,2\'
will print to stdout if the files was thinned with the above thinning
attributes, would the same Asset file result in both cases.
.It Fl n
given a comma separated list of names, any assets in the car file that
match one of the given names are preserved. Names are compared case
insensitivly Name == name, uses the -o --output file to save the
resulting .car file.
.It Fl Z
do an integrity check of the input file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gdiffmk
compares two
.BR groff (1),
.BR nroff (1),
or
.BR troff (1)
documents,
.I file1
and
.IR file2 ,
and creates an output which is
.I file2
with added `margin character' (.mc) commands that indicate the differences.
.
.LP
If the
.I output
filename is present,
the output is written there.
If it is
.B \-
or absent the output is written to the standard output.
.
.LP
If the
.I file1
or
.I file2
argument is
.B \-
the standard input is read for that input.
Clearly both cannot be
.BR \- .
.
.LP
Note that the output is not necessarily compatible with all macro packages
and all preprocessors.
See the
.B BUGS
section below.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-a addmark
Use the
.I addmark
for source lines not in
.I file1
but present in
.IR file2 .
Default:
.BR + .
.
.TP
.B \-B
By default, the deleted texts marked by the
.B \-D
option end
with an added troff break command,
.BR .br ,
to ensure that the deletions are marked properly.
This is the only way to guarantee that deletions and small
changes get flagged.
This option directs the program not to insert these breaks; it makes no
sense to use it without
.BR \-D .
.
.TP
.BI \-c changemark
Use the
.I changemark
for changed source lines.
Default:
.BR | .
.
.TP
.BI \-d deletemark
Use the
.I deletemark
for deleted source lines.
Default:
.BR * .
.
.TP
.B \-D
Show the deleted portions from changed and deleted text.
Default delimiting marks:
.BR "[[" " .\&.\&.\&. " "]]" .
.
.TP
.BI \-M "mark1 mark2"
Change the delimiting marks for the
.B \-D
option.
It makes no sense to use this option without
.BR \-D .
.
.TP
.BI \-x diffcmd
Use the
.I diffcmd
command to perform the comparison of
.I file1
and
.IR file2 .
In particular,
.I diffcmd
should accept the GNU
.B diff
.BI \-D name
option.
Default:
.BR diff (1).
.
.TP
.B \-\-
All the following arguments are treated as file names,
even if they begin with
.BR \- .
.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print a usage message on standard error output and exit.
.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print version information on the standard output and exit.
.
.
.SH BUGS
The output is not necessarily compatible with all macro packages
and all preprocessors.
A workaround that is often successful against preprocessor problems
is to run
.B gdiffmk
on the output of all the preprocessors instead of the input source.
.
.LP
.B gdiffmk
relies on the
.BI \-D name
option of GNU
.BR diff (1)
to make a merged `#ifdef' output format.
It hasn't been tested whether other versions of
.BR diff (1)
do support this option.
See also the
.BI \-x diffcmd
option.
.
.LP
Report bugs to bug-groff@gnu.org.
Include a complete, self-contained example that will allow the bug to
be reproduced, and say which version of
.B gdiffmk
you are using.

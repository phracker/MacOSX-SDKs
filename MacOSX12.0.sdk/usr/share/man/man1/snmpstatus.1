.TH SNMPSTATUS 1 "25 Jul 2003" V5.6.2.1 "Net-SNMP"
.SH NAME
snmpstatus - retrieves a fixed set of management information from a network entity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpstatus
[COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] AGENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpstatus
is an SNMP application that retrieves several important statistics
from a network entity.
.PP
AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented
to monitor the given objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT
specification will consist of a hostname or an IPv4 address.
n this situation, the command will attempt communication with
the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of the given target host.
.PP
See the 
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page for a full list of the possible formats for AGENT.
.PP
The information returned is:
.IP
The IP address of the entity.
.br
A textual description of the entity (sysDescr.0)
.br
The uptime of the entity's SNMP agent (sysUpTime.0)
.br
The sum of received packets on all interfaces
(ifInUCastPkts.* + ifInNUCastPkts.*)
.br
The sum of transmitted packets on all interfaces
(ifOutUCastPkts.* + ifOutNUCastPkts.*)
.br
The number of IP input packets (ipInReceives.0)
.br
The number of IP output packets (ipOutRequests.0)
.PP
For example:
.PP
snmpstatus -c public -v 1 netdev-kbox.cc.cmu.edu
.PP
will produce output similar to the following:
.PP
[128.2.56.220]=>[Kinetics FastPath2] Up: 1 day, 4:43:31
.br
Interfaces: 1,  Recv/Trans packets: 262874/39867 |
IP: 31603/15805
.PP
.B snmpstatus
also checks the operational status of all interfaces (ifOperStatus.*),
and if it finds any that are not running, it will report in a manner
similar to this:
.PP
2 interfaces are down!
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
pinpoint in what way the request was malformed.
.B snmpstatus
will attempt to reform its request to eliminate the malformed
variable (unless the
.B -Cf
option is given, see below), but this variable will then be missing
from the displayed data.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B COMMON OPTIONS
Please see
.I snmpcmd(1)
for a list of possible values for COMMON OPTIONS
as well as their descriptions.
.TP
.B -Cf
By default, snmpstatus will try to fix errors returned
by the agent and retry a request. In this situation,
the command will display the data that it can. If the -Cf option
is specified, then snmpstatus will not try to fix
errors, and the error will cause the command to terminate.

This document describes differences between the 5.8.0 release and
the 5.8.1 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read
the perl58delta, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and
5.8.0.
.PP
In case you are wondering about 5.6.1, it was bug-fix-wise rather
identical to the development release 5.7.1.  Confused?  This timeline
hopefully helps a bit: it lists the new major releases, their maintenance
releases, and the development releases.

.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Hash Randomisation"
.IX Subsection "Hash Randomisation"
Mainly due to security reasons, the \*(L"random ordering\*(R" of hashes
has been made even more random.  Previously while the order of hash
elements from \fIkeys()\fR, \fIvalues()\fR, and \fIeach()\fR was essentially random,
it was still repeatable.  Now, however, the order varies between
different runs of Perl.
.PP
\&\fBPerl has never guaranteed any ordering of the hash keys\fR, and the
ordering has already changed several times during the lifetime of
Perl 5.  Also, the ordering of hash keys has always been, and
continues to be, affected by the insertion order.
.PP
The added randomness may affect applications.
.PP
One possible scenario is when output of an application has included
hash data.  For example, if you have used the Data::Dumper module to
dump data into different files, and then compared the files to see
whether the data has changed, now you will have false positives since
the order in which hashes are dumped will vary.  In general the cure
is to sort the keys (or the values); in particular for Data::Dumper to
use the \f(CW\*(C`Sortkeys\*(C'\fR option.  If some particular order is really
important, use tied hashes: for example the Tie::IxHash module
which by default preserves the order in which the hash elements
were added.
.PP
More subtle problem is reliance on the order of \*(L"global destruction\*(R".
That is what happens at the end of execution: Perl destroys all data
structures, including user data.  If your destructors (the \s-1DESTROY\s0
subroutines) have assumed any particular ordering to the global
destruction, there might be problems ahead.  For example, in a
destructor of one object you cannot assume that objects of any other
class are still available, unless you hold a reference to them.
If the environment variable \s-1PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL\s0 is set to a non-zero
value, or if Perl is exiting a spawned thread, it will also destruct
the ordinary references and the symbol tables that are no longer in use.
You can't call a class method or an ordinary function on a class that
has been collected that way.
.PP
The hash randomisation is certain to reveal hidden assumptions about
some particular ordering of hash elements, and outright bugs: it
revealed a few bugs in the Perl core and core modules.
.PP
To disable the hash randomisation in runtime, set the environment
variable \s-1PERL_HASH_SEED\s0 to 0 (zero) before running Perl (for more
information see \*(L"\s-1PERL_HASH_SEED\*(R"\s0 in perlrun), or to disable the feature
completely in compile time, compile with \f(CW\*(C`\-DNO_HASH_SEED\*(C'\fR (see \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR).
.PP
See \*(L"Algorithmic Complexity Attacks\*(R" in perlsec for the original
rationale behind this change.
.SS "\s-1UTF\-8\s0 On Filehandles No Longer Activated By Locale"
.IX Subsection "UTF-8 On Filehandles No Longer Activated By Locale"
In Perl 5.8.0 all filehandles, including the standard filehandles,
were implicitly set to be in Unicode \s-1UTF\-8\s0 if the locale settings
indicated the use of \s-1UTF\-8. \s0 This feature caused too many problems,
so the feature was turned off and redesigned: see \*(L"Core Enhancements\*(R".
.ie n .SS "Single-number v\-strings are no longer v\-strings before ""=>"""
.el .SS "Single-number v\-strings are no longer v\-strings before ``=>''"
.IX Subsection "Single-number v-strings are no longer v-strings before =>"
The version strings or v\-strings (see \*(L"Version Strings\*(R" in perldata)
feature introduced in Perl 5.6.0 has been a source of some confusion\*(--
especially when the user did not want to use it, but Perl thought it
knew better.  Especially troublesome has been the feature that before
a \*(L"=>\*(R" a version string (a \*(L"v\*(R" followed by digits) has been interpreted
as a v\-string instead of a string literal.  In other words:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        %h = ( v65 => 42 );
.Ve
.PP
has meant since Perl 5.6.0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        %h = ( \*(AqA\*(Aq => 42 );
.Ve
.PP
(at least in platforms of \s-1ASCII\s0 progeny)  Perl 5.8.1 restores the
more natural interpretation
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        %h = ( \*(Aqv65\*(Aq => 42 );
.Ve
.PP
The multi-number v\-strings like v65.66 and 65.66.67 still continue to
be v\-strings in Perl 5.8.
.SS "(Win32) The \-C Switch Has Been Repurposed"
.IX Subsection "(Win32) The -C Switch Has Been Repurposed"
The \-C switch has changed in an incompatible way.  The old semantics
of this switch only made sense in Win32 and only in the \*(L"use utf8\*(R"
universe in 5.6.x releases, and do not make sense for the Unicode
implementation in 5.8.0.  Since this switch could not have been used
by anyone, it has been repurposed.  The behavior that this switch
enabled in 5.6.x releases may be supported in a transparent,
data-dependent fashion in a future release.
.PP
For the new life of this switch, see \*(L"\s-1UTF\-8\s0 no longer default under
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales\*(R", and \*(L"\-C\*(R" in perlrun.
.SS "(Win32) The /d Switch Of cmd.exe"
.IX Subsection "(Win32) The /d Switch Of cmd.exe"
Perl 5.8.1 uses the /d switch when running the cmd.exe shell
internally for \fIsystem()\fR, backticks, and when opening pipes to external
programs.  The extra switch disables the execution of AutoRun commands
from the registry, which is generally considered undesirable when
running external programs.  If you wish to retain compatibility with
the older behavior, set \s-1PERL5SHELL\s0 in your environment to \f(CW\*(C`cmd /x/c\*(C'\fR.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "\s-1UTF\-8\s0 no longer default under \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales"
.IX Subsection "UTF-8 no longer default under UTF-8 locales"
In Perl 5.8.0 many Unicode features were introduced.   One of them
was found to be of more nuisance than benefit: the automagic
(and silent) \*(L"UTF\-8\-ification\*(R" of filehandles, including the
standard filehandles, if the user's locale settings indicated
use of \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
.PP
For example, if you had \f(CW\*(C`en_US.UTF\-8\*(C'\fR as your locale, your \s-1STDIN\s0 and
\&\s-1STDOUT\s0 were automatically \*(L"\s-1UTF\-8\*(R",\s0 in other words an implicit
binmode(..., \*(L":utf8\*(R") was made.  This meant that trying to print, say,
\&\fIchr\fR\|(0xff), ended up printing the bytes 0xc3 0xbf.  Hardly what
you had in mind unless you were aware of this feature of Perl 5.8.0.
The problem is that the vast majority of people weren't: for example
in RedHat releases 8 and 9 the \fBdefault\fR locale setting is \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 so
all RedHat users got \s-1UTF\-8\s0 filehandles, whether they wanted it or not.
The pain was intensified by the Unicode implementation of Perl 5.8.0
(still) having nasty bugs, especially related to the use of s/// and
tr///.  (Bugs that have been fixed in 5.8.1)
.PP
Therefore a decision was made to backtrack the feature and change it
from implicit silent default to explicit conscious option.  The new
Perl command line option \f(CW\*(C`\-C\*(C'\fR and its counterpart environment
variable \s-1PERL_UNICODE\s0 can now be used to control how Perl and Unicode
interact at interfaces like I/O and for example the command line
arguments.  See \*(L"\-C\*(R" in perlrun and \*(L"\s-1PERL_UNICODE\*(R"\s0 in perlrun for more
information.
.SS "Unsafe signals again available"
.IX Subsection "Unsafe signals again available"
In Perl 5.8.0 the so-called \*(L"safe signals\*(R" were introduced.  This
means that Perl no longer handles signals immediately but instead
\&\*(L"between opcodes\*(R", when it is safe to do so.  The earlier immediate
handling easily could corrupt the internal state of Perl, resulting
in mysterious crashes.
.PP
However, the new safer model has its problems too.  Because now an
opcode, a basic unit of Perl execution, is never interrupted but
instead let to run to completion, certain operations that can take a
long time now really do take a long time.  For example, certain
network operations have their own blocking and timeout mechanisms, and
being able to interrupt them immediately would be nice.
.PP
Therefore perl 5.8.1 introduces a \*(L"backdoor\*(R" to restore the pre\-5.8.0
(pre\-5.7.3, really) signal behaviour.  Just set the environment variable
\&\s-1PERL_SIGNALS\s0 to \f(CW\*(C`unsafe\*(C'\fR, and the old immediate (and unsafe)
signal handling behaviour returns.  See \*(L"\s-1PERL_SIGNALS\*(R"\s0 in perlrun
and \*(L"Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)\*(R" in perlipc.
.PP
In completely unrelated news, you can now use safe signals with
POSIX::SigAction.  See \*(L"POSIX::SigAction\*(R" in \s-1POSIX\s0.
.SS "Tied Arrays with Negative Array Indices"
.IX Subsection "Tied Arrays with Negative Array Indices"
Formerly, the indices passed to \f(CW\*(C`FETCH\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`STORE\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`EXISTS\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`DELETE\*(C'\fR methods in tied array class were always non-negative.  If
the actual argument was negative, Perl would call \s-1FETCHSIZE\s0 implicitly
and add the result to the index before passing the result to the tied
array method.  This behaviour is now optional.  If the tied array class
contains a package variable named \f(CW$NEGATIVE_INDICES\fR which is set to
a true value, negative values will be passed to \f(CW\*(C`FETCH\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`STORE\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`EXISTS\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`DELETE\*(C'\fR unchanged.

.SS "Unicode Character Database 4.0.0"
.IX Subsection "Unicode Character Database 4.0.0"
The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has
been updated to 4.0.0 from 3.2.0.  This means for example that the
Unicode character properties are as in Unicode 4.0.0.
.SS "Deprecation Warnings"
.IX Subsection "Deprecation Warnings"
There is one new feature deprecation.  Perl 5.8.0 forgot to add
some deprecation warnings, these warnings have now been added.
Finally, a reminder of an impending feature removal.

Pseudo-hashes were deprecated in Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in
Perl 5.10.0, see perl58delta for details.  Each attempt to access
pseudo-hashes will trigger the warning \f(CW\*(C`Pseudo\-hashes are deprecated\*(C'\fR.
If you really want to continue using pseudo-hashes but not to see the

\&\f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR in void context is no longer expensive. \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR is now context
aware, and will not construct a list if called in void context.
.PP
If a socket gets closed by the server while printing to it, the client
now gets a \s-1SIGPIPE. \s0 While this new feature was not planned, it fell

.IX Item "strict"
Earlier versions of the strict pragma did not check the parameters
implicitly passed to its \*(L"import\*(R" (use) and \*(L"unimport\*(R" (no) routine.
This caused the false idiom such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        use strict qw(@ISA);
\&        @ISA = qw(Foo);
.Ve
.Sp
This however (probably) raised the false expectation that the strict
refs, vars and subs were being enforced (and that \f(CW@ISA\fR was somehow
\&\*(L"declared\*(R").  But the strict refs, vars, and subs are \fBnot\fR enforced
when using this false idiom.
.Sp
Starting from Perl 5.8.1, the above \fBwill\fR cause an error to be
raised.  This may cause programs which used to execute seemingly
correctly without warnings and errors to fail when run under 5.8.1.
This happens because
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        use strict qw(@ISA);
.Ve
.Sp
will now fail with the error:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        Unknown \*(Aqstrict\*(Aq tag(s) \*(Aq@ISA\*(Aq

There have been many fixes in the area of anonymous subs, lexicals and
closures.  Although this means that Perl is now more \*(L"correct\*(R", it is
possible that some existing code will break that happens to rely on
the faulty behaviour.  In practice this is unlikely unless your code
contains a very complex nesting of anonymous subs, evals and lexicals.
.SS "Generic fixes"
.IX Subsection "Generic fixes"
If an input filehandle is marked \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR and Perl sees illegal \s-1UTF\-8\s0
coming in when doing \f(CW\*(C`<FH>\*(C'\fR, if warnings are enabled a warning is
immediately given \- instead of being silent about it and Perl being
unhappy about the broken data later.  (The \f(CW\*(C`:encoding(utf8)\*(C'\fR layer
also works the same way.)
.PP
binmode(\s-1SOCKET, \s0\*(L":utf8\*(R") only worked on the input side, not on the
output side of the socket.  Now it works both ways.
.PP
For threaded Perls certain system database functions like \fIgetpwent()\fR
and \fIgetgrent()\fR now grow their result buffer dynamically, instead of
failing.  This means that at sites with lots of users and groups the
functions no longer fail by returning only partial results.
.PP
Perl 5.8.0 had accidentally broken the capability for users

.PP
In 5.8.0 this
.PP
.Vb 1

been fixed.
.PP
Tied methods like \s-1FETCH\s0 etc. may now safely access tied values, i.e.
resulting in a recursive call to \s-1FETCH\s0 etc.  Remember to break the
recursion, though.
.PP
At startup Perl blocks the \s-1SIGFPE\s0 signal away since there isn't much
Perl can do about it.  Previously this blocking was in effect also for
programs executed from within Perl.  Now Perl restores the original

programs.
.PP
Linenumbers in Perl scripts may now be greater than 65536, or 2**16.

that the linenumber for reported errors and warnings have \*(L"wrapped

your code a bit, such Perl scripts do exist, for example as results
from generated code.  Now linenumbers can go all the way to

necessary to access these long values from outside Perl, be aware that
they are implemented using search list logical names that store the
value in pieces, each 255\-byte piece (up to 128 of them) being an
element in the search list. When doing a lookup in \f(CW%ENV\fR from within
Perl, the elements are combined into a single value.  The existing

logical name via the \f(CW$ENV\fR{'foo;N'} syntax (where N is the search list

.IX Subsection "IRIX: t/uni/tr_7jis.t falsely failing"
The test t/uni/tr_7jis.t is known to report failure under 'make test'
or the test harness with certain releases of \s-1IRIX \s0(at least \s-1IRIX 6.5\s0
and MIPSpro Compilers Version 7.3.1.1m), but if run manually the test
fully passes.
.SS "Mac \s-1OS X:\s0 no usemymalloc"
.IX Subsection "Mac OS X: no usemymalloc"
The Perl malloc (\f(CW\*(C`\-Dusemymalloc\*(C'\fR) does not work at all in Mac \s-1OS X.\s0
This is not that serious, though, since the native malloc works just
fine.
.SS "Tru64: No threaded builds with \s-1GNU\s0 cc (gcc)"
.IX Subsection "Tru64: No threaded builds with GNU cc (gcc)"
In the latest Tru64 releases (e.g. v5.1B or later) gcc cannot be used
to compile a threaded Perl (\-Duseithreads) because the system
\&\f(CW\*(C`<pthread.h>\*(C'\fR file doesn't know about gcc.
.SS "Win32: sysopen, sysread, syswrite"
.IX Subsection "Win32: sysopen, sysread, syswrite"
As of the 5.8.0 release, \fIsysopen()\fR/\fIsysread()\fR/\fIsyswrite()\fR do not behave
like they used to in 5.6.1 and earlier with respect to \*(L"text\*(R" mode.
These built-ins now always operate in \*(L"binary\*(R" mode (even if \fIsysopen()\fR
was passed the O_TEXT flag, or if \fIbinmode()\fR was used on the file
handle).  Note that this issue should only make a difference for disk
files, as sockets and pipes have always been in \*(L"binary\*(R" mode in the
Windows port.  As this behavior is currently considered a bug,
compatible behavior may be re-introduced in a future release.  Until
then, the use of \fIsysopen()\fR, \fIsysread()\fR and \fIsyswrite()\fR is not supported
for \*(L"text\*(R" mode operations.
.SH "Future Directions"
.IX Header "Future Directions"
The following things \fBmight\fR happen in future.  The first publicly
available releases having these characteristics will be the developer
releases Perl 5.9.x, culminating in the Perl 5.10.0 release.  These
are our best guesses at the moment: we reserve the right to rethink.

PerlIO will become The Default.  Currently (in Perl 5.8.x) the stdio
library is still used if Perl thinks it can use certain tricks to
make stdio go \fBreally\fR fast.  For future releases our goal is to
make PerlIO go even faster.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A new feature called \fIassertions\fR will be available.  This means that
one can have code called assertions sprinkled in the code: usually
they are optimised away, but they can be enabled with the \f(CW\*(C`\-A\*(C'\fR option.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A new operator \f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR (defined-or) will be available.  This means that
one will be able to say
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $a // $b
.Ve
.Sp
instead of
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   defined $a ? $a : $b
.Ve
.Sp
and
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   $c //= $d;
.Ve
.Sp
instead of
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   $c = $d unless defined $c;
.Ve
.Sp
The operator will have the same precedence and associativity as \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR.
A source code patch against the Perl 5.8.1 sources will be available
in \s-1CPAN\s0 as \fIauthors/id/H/HM/HMBRAND/dor\-5.8.1.diff\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`unpack()\*(C'\fR will default to unpacking the \f(CW$_\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Various Copy-On-Write techniques will be investigated in hopes
of speeding up Perl.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1CPANPLUS,\s0 Inline, and Module::Build will become core modules.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The ability to write true lexically scoped pragmas will be introduced.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Work will continue on the bytecompiler and byteloader.
.IP "\(bu" 4
v\-strings as they currently exist are scheduled to be deprecated.  The
v\-less form (1.2.3) will become a \*(L"version object\*(R" when used with \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW$VERSION\fR.  $^V will also be a \*(L"version object\*(R" so the
printf(\*(L"%vd\*(R",...) construct will no longer be needed.  The v\-ful version
(v1.2.3) will become obsolete.  The equivalence of strings and v\-strings (e.g.
that currently 5.8.0 is equal to \*(L"\e5\e8\e0\*(R") will go away.  \fBThere may be no
deprecation warning for v\-strings\fR, though: it is quite hard to detect when
v\-strings are being used safely, and when they are not.

5.005 Threads Will Be Removed

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the \fBperlbug\fR
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search

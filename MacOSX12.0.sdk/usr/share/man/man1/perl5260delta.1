.SH "NAME"
perl5260delta \- what is new for perl v5.26.0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes the differences between the 5.24.0 release and the
5.26.0 release.
.SH "Notice"
.IX Header "Notice"
This release includes three updates with widespread effects:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW"."\fR no longer in \f(CW@INC\fR
.Sp
For security reasons, the current directory (\f(CW"."\fR) is no longer included
by default at the end of the module search path (\f(CW@INC\fR). This may have
widespread implications for the building, testing and installing of
modules, and for the execution of scripts.  See the section
"Removal of the current directory (\f(CW"."\fR) from \f(CW@INC\fR"
for the full details.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR may now warn
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR now gives a deprecation warning when it fails to load a file which
it would have loaded had \f(CW"."\fR been in \f(CW@INC\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
In regular expression patterns, a literal left brace \f(CW"{"\fR
should be escaped
.Sp
See "Unescaped literal \f(CW"{"\fR characters in regular expression patterns are no longer permissible".
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "Lexical subroutines are no longer experimental"
.IX Subsection "Lexical subroutines are no longer experimental"
Using the \f(CW\*(C`lexical_subs\*(C'\fR feature introduced in v5.18 no longer emits a warning.  Existing
code that disables the \f(CW\*(C`experimental::lexical_subs\*(C'\fR warning category
that the feature previously used will continue to work.  The
\&\f(CW\*(C`lexical_subs\*(C'\fR feature has no effect; all Perl code can use lexical
subroutines, regardless of what feature declarations are in scope.
.SS "Indented Here-documents"
.IX Subsection "Indented Here-documents"
This adds a new modifier \f(CW"~"\fR to here-docs that tells the parser
that it should look for \f(CW\*(C`/^\es*$DELIM\en/\*(C'\fR as the closing delimiter.
.PP
These syntaxes are all supported:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    <<~EOF;
\&    <<~\eEOF;
\&    <<~\*(AqEOF\*(Aq;
\&    <<~"EOF";
\&    <<~\`EOF\`;
\&    <<~ \*(AqEOF\*(Aq;
\&    <<~ "EOF";
\&    <<~ \`EOF\`;
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW"~"\fR modifier will strip, from each line in the here-doc, the
same whitespace that appears before the delimiter.
.PP
Newlines will be copied as-is, and lines that don't include the
proper beginning whitespace will cause perl to croak.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    if (1) {
\&      print <<~EOF;
\&        Hello there
\&        EOF
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
prints \*(L"Hello there\en\*(R" with no leading whitespace.
.ie n .SS "New regular expression modifier ""/xx"""
.el .SS "New regular expression modifier \f(CW/xx\fP"
.IX Subsection "New regular expression modifier /xx"
Specifying two \f(CW"x"\fR characters to modify a regular expression pattern
does everything that a single one does, but additionally \s-1TAB\s0 and \s-1SPACE\s0
characters within a bracketed character class are generally ignored and
can be added to improve readability, like
\&\f(CW\*(C`/[\ ^\ A\-Z\ d\-f\ p\-x\ ]/xx\*(C'\fR.  Details are at
\&\*(L"/x and /xx\*(R" in perlre.
.ie n .SS """@{^CAPTURE}"", ""%{^CAPTURE}"", and ""%{^CAPTURE_ALL}"""
.el .SS "\f(CW@{^CAPTURE}\fP, \f(CW%{^CAPTURE}\fP, and \f(CW%{^CAPTURE_ALL}\fP"
.IX Subsection "@{^CAPTURE}, %{^CAPTURE}, and %{^CAPTURE_ALL}"
\&\f(CW\*(C`@{^CAPTURE}\*(C'\fR exposes the capture buffers of the last match as an
array.  So \f(CW$1\fR is \f(CW\*(C`${^CAPTURE}[0]\*(C'\fR.  This is a more efficient equivalent
to code like \f(CW\*(C`substr($matched_string,$\-[0],$+[0]\-$\-[0])\*(C'\fR, and you don't
have to keep track of the \f(CW$matched_string\fR either.  This variable has no
single character equivalent.  Note that, like the other regex magic variables,
the contents of this variable is dynamic; if you wish to store it beyond
the lifetime of the match you must copy it to another array.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`%{^CAPTURE}\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`%+\*(C'\fR (\fIi.e.\fR, named captures).  Other than
being more self-documenting there is no difference between the two forms.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`%{^CAPTURE_ALL}\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`%\-\*(C'\fR (\fIi.e.\fR, all named captures).
Other than being more self-documenting there is no difference between the
two forms.
.SS "Declaring a reference to a variable"
.IX Subsection "Declaring a reference to a variable"
As an experimental feature, Perl now allows the referencing operator to come
after \f(CW\*(C`my()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`state()\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`our()\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`local()\*(C'\fR.  This syntax must
be enabled with \f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqdeclared_refs\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.  It is experimental, and will
warn by default unless \f(CW\*(C`no warnings \*(Aqexperimental::refaliasing\*(Aq\*(C'\fR is in effect.
It is intended mainly for use in assignments to references.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use experimental \*(Aqrefaliasing\*(Aq, \*(Aqdeclared_refs\*(Aq;
\&    my \e$a = \e$b;
.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"Assigning to References\*(R" in perlref for more details.
.SS "Unicode 9.0 is now supported"
.IX Subsection "Unicode 9.0 is now supported"
A list of changes is at <http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/>.
Modules that are shipped with core Perl but not maintained by p5p do not
necessarily support Unicode 9.0.  Unicode::Normalize does work on 9.0.
.ie n .SS "Use of ""\ep{\f(CIscript\fP}"" uses the improved Script_Extensions property"
.el .SS "Use of \f(CW\ep{\fP\f(CIscript\fP\f(CW}\fP uses the improved Script_Extensions property"
.IX Subsection "Use of p{script} uses the improved Script_Extensions property"
Unicode 6.0 introduced an improved form of the Script (\f(CW\*(C`sc\*(C'\fR) property, and
called it Script_Extensions (\f(CW\*(C`scx\*(C'\fR).  Perl now uses this improved
version when a property is specified as just \f(CW\*(C`\ep{\f(CIscript\f(CW}\*(C'\fR.  This
should make programs more accurate when determining if a character is
used in a given script, but there is a slight chance of breakage for
programs that very specifically needed the old behavior.  The meaning of
compound forms, like \f(CW\*(C`\ep{sc=\f(CIscript\f(CW}\*(C'\fR are unchanged.  See
\&\*(L"Scripts\*(R" in perlunicode.
.SS "Perl can now do default collation in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales on platforms that support it"
.IX Subsection "Perl can now do default collation in UTF-8 locales on platforms that support it"
Some platforms natively do a reasonable job of collating and sorting in
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales.  Perl now works with those.  For portability and full
control, Unicode::Collate is still recommended, but now you may
not need to do anything special to get good-enough results, depending on
your application.  See
"Category \f(CW\*(C`LC_COLLATE\*(C'\fR: Collation: Text Comparisons and Sorting" in perllocale.
.ie n .SS "Better locale collation of strings containing embedded ""NUL"" characters"
.el .SS "Better locale collation of strings containing embedded \f(CWNUL\fP characters"
.IX Subsection "Better locale collation of strings containing embedded NUL characters"
In locales that have multi-level character weights, \f(CW\*(C`NUL\*(C'\fRs are now
ignored at the higher priority ones.  There are still some gotchas in
some strings, though.  See
"Collation of strings containing embedded \f(CW\*(C`NUL\*(C'\fR characters" in perllocale.
.ie n .SS """CORE"" subroutines for hash and array functions callable via reference"
.el .SS "\f(CWCORE\fP subroutines for hash and array functions callable via reference"
.IX Subsection "CORE subroutines for hash and array functions callable via reference"
The hash and array functions in the \f(CW\*(C`CORE\*(C'\fR namespace (\f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`push\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pop\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`shift\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`unshift\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`splice\*(C'\fR) can now
be called with ampersand syntax (\f(CW\*(C`&CORE::keys(\e%hash\*(C'\fR) and via reference
(\f(CW\*(C`my $k = \e&CORE::keys; $k\->(\e%hash)\*(C'\fR).  Previously they could only be
used when inlined.
.SS "New Hash Function For 64\-bit Builds"
.IX Subsection "New Hash Function For 64-bit Builds"
We have switched to a hybrid hash function to better balance
performance for short and long keys.
.PP
For short keys, 16 bytes and under, we use an optimised variant of
One At A Time Hard, and for longer keys we use Siphash 1\-3.  For very
long keys this is a big improvement in performance.  For shorter keys
there is a modest improvement.
.SH "Security"
.IX Header "Security"
.ie n .SS "Removal of the current directory (""."") from @INC"
.el .SS "Removal of the current directory (\f(CW``.''\fP) from \f(CW@INC\fP"
.IX Subsection "Removal of the current directory (""."") from @INC"
The perl binary includes a default set of paths in \f(CW@INC\fR.  Historically
it has also included the current directory (\f(CW"."\fR) as the final entry,
unless run with taint mode enabled (\f(CW\*(C`perl \-T\*(C'\fR).  While convenient, this has
security implications: for example, where a script attempts to load an
optional module when its current directory is untrusted (such as \fI/tmp\fR),
it could load and execute code from under that directory.
.PP
Starting with v5.26, \f(CW"."\fR is always removed by default, not just under
tainting.  This has major implications for installing modules and executing
scripts.
.PP
The following new features have been added to help ameliorate these
issues.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIConfigure \-Udefault_inc_excludes_dot\fR
.Sp
There is a new \fIConfigure\fR option, \f(CW\*(C`default_inc_excludes_dot\*(C'\fR (enabled
by default) which builds a perl executable without \f(CW"."\fR; unsetting this
option using \f(CW\*(C`\-U\*(C'\fR reverts perl to the old behaviour.  This may fix your
path issues but will reintroduce all the security concerns, so don't
build a perl executable like this unless you're \fIreally\fR confident that
such issues are not a concern in your environment.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC\*(C'\fR
.Sp
There is a new environment variable recognised by the perl interpreter.
If this variable has the value 1 when the perl interpreter starts up,
then \f(CW"."\fR will be automatically appended to \f(CW@INC\fR (except under tainting).
.Sp
This allows you restore the old perl interpreter behaviour on a
case-by-case basis.  But note that this is intended to be a temporary crutch,
and this feature will likely be removed in some future perl version.
It is currently set by the \f(CW\*(C`cpan\*(C'\fR utility and \f(CW\*(C`Test::Harness\*(C'\fR to
ease installation of \s-1CPAN\s0 modules which have not been updated to handle the
lack of dot.  Once again, don't use this unless you are sure that this
will not reintroduce any security concerns.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A new deprecation warning issued by \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
While it is well-known that \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR use \f(CW@INC\fR to search
for the file to load, many people don't realise that \f(CW\*(C`do "file"\*(C'\fR also
searches \f(CW@INC\fR if the file is a relative path.  With the removal of \f(CW"."\fR,
a simple \f(CW\*(C`do "file.pl"\*(C'\fR will fail to read in and execute \f(CW\*(C`file.pl\*(C'\fR from
the current directory.  Since this is commonly expected behaviour, a new
deprecation warning is now issued whenever \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR fails to load a file which
it otherwise would have found if a dot had been in \f(CW@INC\fR.
.PP
Here are some things script and module authors may need to do to make
their software work in the new regime.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Script authors
.Sp
If the issue is within your own code (rather than within included
modules), then you have two main options.  Firstly, if you are confident
that your script will only be run within a trusted directory (under which
you expect to find trusted files and modules), then add \f(CW"."\fR back into the
path; \fIe.g.\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    BEGIN {
\&        my $dir = "/some/trusted/directory";
\&        chdir $dir or die "Can\*(Aqt chdir to $dir: $!\en";
\&        # safe now
\&        push @INC, \*(Aq.\*(Aq;
\&    }
\&
\&    use "Foo::Bar"; # may load /some/trusted/directory/Foo/Bar.pm
\&    do "config.pl"; # may load /some/trusted/directory/config.pl
.Ve
.Sp
On the other hand, if your script is intended to be run from within
untrusted directories (such as \fI/tmp\fR), then your script suddenly failing
to load files may be indicative of a security issue.  You most likely want
to replace any relative paths with full paths; for example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    do "foo_config.pl"
.Ve
.Sp
might become
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    do "$ENV{HOME}/foo_config.pl"
.Ve
.Sp
If you are absolutely certain that you want your script to load and
execute a file from the current directory, then use a \f(CW\*(C`./\*(C'\fR prefix; for
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    do "./foo_config.pl"
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Installing and using \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
.Sp
If you install a \s-1CPAN\s0 module using an automatic tool like \f(CW\*(C`cpan\*(C'\fR, then
this tool will itself set the \f(CW\*(C`PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC\*(C'\fR environment variable
while building and testing the module, which may be sufficient to install
a distribution which hasn't been updated to be dot-aware.  If you want to
install such a module manually, then you'll need to replace the
traditional invocation:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install
.Ve
.Sp
with something like
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    (export PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1; \e
\&     perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install)
.Ve
.Sp
Note that this only helps build and install an unfixed module.  It's
possible for the tests to pass (since they were run under
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1\*(C'\fR), but for the module itself to fail to perform
correctly in production.  In this case, you may have to temporarily modify
your script until a fixed version of the module is released.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    use Foo::Bar;
\&    {
\&        local @INC = (@INC, \*(Aq.\*(Aq);
\&        # assuming read_config() needs \*(Aq.\*(Aq in @INC
\&        $config = Foo::Bar\->read_config();
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
This is only rarely expected to be necessary.  Again, if doing this,
assess the resultant risks first.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Module Authors
.Sp
If you maintain a \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution, it may need updating to run in
a dotless environment.  Although \f(CW\*(C`cpan\*(C'\fR and other such tools will
currently set the \f(CW\*(C`PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC\*(C'\fR during module build, this is a
temporary workaround for the set of modules which rely on \f(CW"."\fR being in
\&\f(CW@INC\fR for installation and testing, and this may mask deeper issues.  It
could result in a module which passes tests and installs, but which
fails at run time.
.Sp
During build, test, and install, it will normally be the case that any perl
processes will be executing directly within the root directory of the
untarred distribution, or a known subdirectory of that, such as \fIt/\fR.  It
may well be that \fIMakefile.PL\fR or \fIt/foo.t\fR will attempt to include
local modules and configuration files using their direct relative
filenames, which will now fail.
.Sp
However, as described above, automatic tools like \fIcpan\fR will (for now)
set the \f(CW\*(C`PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC\*(C'\fR environment variable, which introduces
dot during a build.
.Sp
This makes it likely that your existing build and test code will work, but
this may mask issues with your code which only manifest when used after
install.  It is prudent to try and run your build process with that
variable explicitly disabled:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    (export PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=0; \e
\&     perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install)
.Ve
.Sp
This is more likely to show up any potential problems with your module's
build process, or even with the module itself.  Fixing such issues will
ensure both that your module can again be installed manually, and that
it will still build once the \f(CW\*(C`PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC\*(C'\fR crutch goes away.
.Sp
When fixing issues in tests due to the removal of dot from \f(CW@INC\fR,
reinsertion of dot into \f(CW@INC\fR should be performed with caution, for this
too may suppress real errors in your runtime code.  You are encouraged
wherever possible to apply the aforementioned approaches with explicit
absolute/relative paths, or to relocate your needed files into a
subdirectory and insert that subdirectory into \f(CW@INC\fR instead.
.Sp
If your runtime code has problems under the dotless \f(CW@INC\fR, then the comments
above on how to fix for script authors will mostly apply here too.  Bear in
mind though that it is considered bad form for a module to globally add a dot to
\&\f(CW@INC\fR, since it introduces both a security risk and hides issues of
accidentally requiring dot in \f(CW@INC\fR, as explained above.
.SS "Escaped colons and relative paths in \s-1PATH\s0"
.IX Subsection "Escaped colons and relative paths in PATH"
On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR environment
variable as tainted when starting a new process.  Previously, it was
allowing a backslash to escape a colon (unlike the \s-1OS\s0), consequently
allowing relative paths to be considered safe if the \s-1PATH\s0 was set to
something like \f(CW\*(C`/\e:.\*(C'\fR.  The check has been fixed to treat \f(CW"."\fR as tainted
in that example.

calls.  Previously this output would be sent to the file specified
by the \f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_DEBUG\*(C'\fR environment variable if perl wasn't running
setuid and the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR switches hadn't been parsed yet.
.PP
If perl performed output at a point where it hadn't yet parsed its
switches this could result in perl creating or overwriting the file
named by \f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_DEBUG\*(C'\fR even when the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR switch had been supplied.
.PP
Perl now requires the \f(CW\*(C`\-Di\*(C'\fR switch to be present before it will produce
PerlIO debugging
output.  By default this is written to \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR, but can optionally
be redirected to a file by setting the \f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_DEBUG\*(C'\fR environment
variable.
.PP
If perl is running setuid or the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR switch was supplied,
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_DEBUG\*(C'\fR is ignored and the debugging output is sent to
\&\f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR as for any other \f(CW\*(C`\-D\*(C'\fR switch.

You have to now say something like \f(CW"\e{"\fR or \f(CW"[{]"\fR to specify to
match a \s-1LEFT CURLY BRACKET\s0; otherwise, it is a fatal pattern compilation
error.  This change will allow future extensions to the language.
.PP
These have been deprecated since v5.16, with a deprecation message
raised for some uses starting in v5.22.  Unfortunately, the code added
to raise the message was buggy and failed to warn in some cases where
it should have.  Therefore, enforcement of this ban for these cases is
deferred until Perl 5.30, but the code has been fixed to raise a
default-on deprecation message for them in the meantime.
.PP
Some uses of literal \f(CW"{"\fR occur in contexts where we do not foresee
the meaning ever being anything but the literal, such as the very first
character in the pattern, or after a \f(CW"|"\fR meaning alternation.  Thus
.PP
.Vb 1
\& qr/{fee|{fie/
.Ve
.PP
matches either of the strings \f(CW\*(C`{fee\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`{fie\*(C'\fR.  To avoid forcing
unnecessary code changes, these uses do not need to be escaped, and no
warning is raised about them, and there are no current plans to change this.
.PP
But it is always correct to escape \f(CW"{"\fR, and the simple rule to
remember is to always do so.
.PP
See Unescaped left brace in regex is illegal here.
.ie n .SS """scalar(%hash)"" return signature changed"
.el .SS "\f(CWscalar(%hash)\fP return signature changed"
.IX Subsection "scalar(%hash) return signature changed"
The value returned for \f(CW\*(C`scalar(%hash)\*(C'\fR will no longer show information about
the buckets allocated in the hash.  It will simply return the count of used
keys.  It is thus equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`0+keys(%hash)\*(C'\fR.
.PP
A form of backward compatibility is provided via
\&\f(CW\*(C`Hash::Util::bucket_ratio()\*(C'\fR which provides
the same behavior as
\&\f(CW\*(C`scalar(%hash)\*(C'\fR provided in Perl 5.24 and earlier.

This makes the lvalue sub case consistent with \f(CW\*(C`(keys %hash) = ...\*(C'\fR and

.IX Subsection "The ${^ENCODING} facility has been removed"
The special behaviour associated with assigning a value to this variable
has been removed.  As a consequence, the encoding pragma's default mode
is no longer supported.  If
you still need to write your source code in encodings other than \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 use a

A variable name may no longer contain a literal control character under
any circumstances.  These previously were allowed in single-character
names on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms, but have been deprecated there since Perl
5.20.  This affects things like \f(CW\*(C`$\f(CI\ecT\f(CW\*(C'\fR, where \fI\ecT\fR is a literal
control (such as a \f(CW\*(C`NAK\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE\*(C'\fR character) in the

.SS "String delimiters that aren't stand-alone graphemes are now deprecated"
.IX Subsection "String delimiters that aren't stand-alone graphemes are now deprecated"
For Perl to eventually allow string delimiters to be Unicode
grapheme clusters (which look like a single character, but may be
a sequence of several ones), we have to stop allowing a single character
delimiter that isn't a grapheme by itself.  These are unlikely to exist
in actual code, as they would typically display as attached to the
character in front of them.

.IX Subsection "cX that maps to a printable is no longer deprecated"
This means we have no plans to remove this feature.  It still raises a
warning, but only if syntax warnings are enabled.  The feature was
originally intended to be a way to express non-printable characters that
don't have a mnemonic (\f(CW\*(C`\et\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR are mnemonics for two
non-printable characters, but most non-printables don't have a
mnemonic.)  But the feature can be used to specify a few printable
characters, though those are more clearly expressed as the printable
itself.  See

New Faster Hash Function on 64 bit builds
.Sp
We use a different hash function for short and long keys.  This should
improve performance and security, especially for long keys.
.IP "\(bu" 4
readline is faster
.Sp
Reading from a file line-by-line with \f(CW\*(C`readline()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR should
now typically be faster due to a better implementation of the code that
searches for the next newline character.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning one reference to another, \fIe.g.\fR \f(CW\*(C`$ref1 = $ref2\*(C'\fR has been
optimized in some cases.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Remove some exceptions to creating Copy-on-Write strings. The string
buffer growth algorithm has been slightly altered so that you're less
likely to encounter a string which can't be COWed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Better optimise array and hash assignment: where an array or hash appears
in the \s-1LHS\s0 of a list assignment, such as \f(CW\*(C`(..., @a) = (...);\*(C'\fR, it's
likely to be considerably faster, especially if it involves emptying the
array/hash. For example, this code runs about a third faster compared to
Perl 5.24.0:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    my @a;
\&    for my $i (1..10_000_000) {
\&        @a = (1,2,3);
\&        @a = ();
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Converting a single-digit string to a number is now substantially faster.

for the two specially-handled forms
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my    @a = split ...;
\&    local @a = split ...;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
The rather slow implementation for the experimental subroutine signatures
feature has been made much faster; it is now comparable in speed with the
traditional \f(CW\*(C`my ($a, $b, @c) = @_\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Bareword constant strings are now permitted to take part in constant
folding.  They were originally exempted from constant folding in August 1999,
during the development of Perl 5.6, to ensure that \f(CW\*(C`use strict "subs"\*(C'\fR
would still apply to bareword constants.  That has now been accomplished a
different way, so barewords, like other constants, now gain the performance
benefits of constant folding.
.Sp
This also means that void-context warnings on constant expressions of
barewords now report the folded constant operand, rather than the operation;
this matches the behaviour for non-bareword constants.

The functions \f(CW\*(C`utf8n_to_uvchr\*(C'\fR and its

.Sp
Calling them, while passing a string length of 0 is now asserted against

CHARACTER.\s0   If you have nothing to decode, you shouldn't call the decode
function.
.Sp
They now return the Unicode \s-1REPLACEMENT CHARACTER\s0 if called with \s-1UTF\-8\s0
that has the overlong malformation and that malformation is allowed by
the input parameters.  This malformation is where the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 looks valid
syntactically, but there is a shorter sequence that yields the same code
point.  This has been forbidden since Unicode version 3.1.
.Sp
They now accept an input
flag to allow the overflow malformation.  This malformation is when the
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 may be syntactically valid, but the code point it represents is
not capable of being represented in the word length on the platform.
What \*(L"allowed\*(R" means, in this case, is that the function doesn't return an
error, and it advances the parse pointer to beyond the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 in
question, but it returns the Unicode \s-1REPLACEMENT CHARACTER\s0 as the value
of the code point (since the real value is not representable).
.Sp
They no longer abandon searching for other malformations when the first
one is encountered.  A call to one of these functions thus can generate
multiple diagnostics, instead of just one.

\&\f(CW\*(C`valid_utf8_to_uvchr()\*(C'\fR has been added

Perl wasn't correctly handling true/false values in the \s-1LHS\s0 of a list
assign; specifically the truth values returned by boolean operators.
This could trigger an assertion failure in something like the following:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    for ($x > $y) {
\&        ($_, ...) = (...); # here $_ is aliased to a truth value
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
This was a regression from v5.24.

Fix error message for unclosed \f(CW\*(C`\eN{\*(C'\fR in a regex.  An unclosed \f(CW\*(C`\eN{\*(C'\fR

List assignment in list context where the \s-1LHS\s0 contained aggregates and
where there were not enough \s-1RHS\s0 elements, used to skip scalar lvalues.
Previously, \f(CW\*(C`(($a,$b,@c,$d) = (1))\*(C'\fR in list context returned \f(CW\*(C`($a)\*(C'\fR; now
it returns \f(CW\*(C`($a,$b,$d)\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`(($a,$b,$c) = (1))\*(C'\fR is unchanged: it still
returns \f(CW\*(C`($a,$b,$c)\*(C'\fR.  This can be seen in the following:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    sub inc { $_++ for @_ }
\&    inc(($a,$b,@c,$d) = (10))
.Ve
.Sp
Formerly, the values of \f(CW\*(C`($a,$b,$d)\*(C'\fR would be left as \f(CW\*(C`(11,undef,undef)\*(C'\fR;
now they are \f(CW\*(C`(11,1,1)\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Code like this: \f(CW\*(C`/(?{ s!!! })/\*(C'\fR could trigger infinite recursion on the C
stack (not the normal perl stack) when the last successful pattern in
scope is itself.  We avoid the segfault by simply forbidding the use of
the empty pattern when it would resolve to the currently executing
pattern.

Jon Portnoy (\s-1AVENJ\s0), a prolific Perl author and admired Gentoo community
member, has passed away on August 10, 2016.  He will be remembered and
missed by all those who he came in contact with, and enriched with his
intellect, wit, and spirit.
.PP
It is with great sadness that we also note Kip Hampton's passing.  Probably
best known as the author of the Perl & \s-1XML\s0 column on \s-1XML\s0.com, he was a
core contributor to AxKit, an \s-1XML\s0 server platform that became an Apache
Foundation project.  He was a frequent speaker in the early days at
\&\s-1OSCON,\s0 and most recently at \s-1YAPC::NA\s0 in Madison.  He was frequently on
irc.perl.org as ubu, generally in the #axkit\-dahut community, the
group responsible for \s-1YAPC::NA\s0 Asheville in 2011.
.PP
Kip and his constant contributions to the community will be greatly
missed.

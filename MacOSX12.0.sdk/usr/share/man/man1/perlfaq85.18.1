perlfaq8 \- System Interaction
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This section of the Perl \s-1FAQ\s0 covers questions involving operating
system interaction. Topics include interprocess communication (\s-1IPC\s0),
control over the user-interface (keyboard, screen and pointing
devices), and most anything else not related to data manipulation.
.PP
Read the FAQs and documentation specific to the port of perl to your
operating system (eg, perlvms, perlplan9, ...). These should
contain more detailed information on the vagaries of your perl.
.SS "How do I find out which operating system I'm running under?"
.IX Subsection "How do I find out which operating system I'm running under?"
The \f(CW$^O\fR variable (\f(CW$OSNAME\fR if you use \f(CW\*(C`English\*(C'\fR) contains an
indication of the name of the operating system (not its release
number) that your perl binary was built for.
.SS "How come \fIexec()\fP doesn't return?"
.IX Xref "exec system fork open pipe"
.IX Subsection "How come exec() doesn't return?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR function's job is to turn your process into another
command and never to return. If that's not what you want to do, don't
use \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR. :)
.PP
If you want to run an external command and still keep your Perl process
going, look at a piped \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR.
.SS "How do I do fancy stuff with the keyboard/screen/mouse?"
.IX Subsection "How do I do fancy stuff with the keyboard/screen/mouse?"
How you access/control keyboards, screens, and pointing devices
(\*(L"mice\*(R") is system-dependent. Try the following modules:
.IP "Keyboard" 4
.IX Item "Keyboard"
.Vb 5
\&    Term::Cap               Standard perl distribution
\&    Term::ReadKey           CPAN
\&    Term::ReadLine::Gnu     CPAN
\&    Term::ReadLine::Perl    CPAN
\&    Term::Screen            CPAN
.Ve
.IP "Screen" 4
.IX Item "Screen"
.Vb 3
\&    Term::Cap               Standard perl distribution
\&    Curses                  CPAN
\&    Term::ANSIColor         CPAN
.Ve
.IP "Mouse" 4
.IX Item "Mouse"
.Vb 4
\&    Tk                      CPAN
\&    Wx                      CPAN

\&    Qt4                     kdebindings4 package
.Ve
.PP
Some of these specific cases are shown as examples in other answers
in this section of the perlfaq.
.SS "How do I print something out in color?"
.IX Subsection "How do I print something out in color?"
In general, you don't, because you don't know whether
the recipient has a color-aware display device. If you
know that they have an \s-1ANSI\s0 terminal that understands
color, you can use the Term::ANSIColor module from \s-1CPAN:\s0
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use Term::ANSIColor;
\&    print color("red"), "Stop!\en", color("reset");
\&    print color("green"), "Go!\en", color("reset");
.Ve
.PP
Or like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use Term::ANSIColor qw(:constants);
\&    print RED, "Stop!\en", RESET;
\&    print GREEN, "Go!\en", RESET;
.Ve
.SS "How do I read just one key without waiting for a return key?"
.IX Subsection "How do I read just one key without waiting for a return key?"
Controlling input buffering is a remarkably system-dependent matter.
On many systems, you can just use the \fBstty\fR command as shown in
\&\*(L"getc\*(R" in perlfunc, but as you see, that's already getting you into
portability snags.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    open(TTY, "+</dev/tty") or die "no tty: $!";
\&    system "stty  cbreak </dev/tty >/dev/tty 2>&1";
\&    $key = getc(TTY);        # perhaps this works
\&    # OR ELSE
\&    sysread(TTY, $key, 1);    # probably this does
\&    system "stty \-cbreak </dev/tty >/dev/tty 2>&1";
.Ve
.PP
The Term::ReadKey module from \s-1CPAN\s0 offers an easy-to-use interface that
should be more efficient than shelling out to \fBstty\fR for each key.
It even includes limited support for Windows.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    use Term::ReadKey;
\&    ReadMode(\*(Aqcbreak\*(Aq);
\&    $key = ReadKey(0);
\&    ReadMode(\*(Aqnormal\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
However, using the code requires that you have a working C compiler
and can use it to build and install a \s-1CPAN\s0 module. Here's a solution
using the standard \s-1POSIX\s0 module, which is already on your system
(assuming your system supports \s-1POSIX\s0).
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use HotKey;
\&    $key = readkey();
.Ve
.PP
And here's the \f(CW\*(C`HotKey\*(C'\fR module, which hides the somewhat mystifying calls
to manipulate the \s-1POSIX\s0 termios structures.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # HotKey.pm
\&    package HotKey;
\&
\&    use strict;
\&    use warnings;
\&
\&    use parent \*(AqExporter\*(Aq;
\&    our @EXPORT = qw(cbreak cooked readkey);
\&
\&    use POSIX qw(:termios_h);
\&    my ($term, $oterm, $echo, $noecho, $fd_stdin);
\&
\&    $fd_stdin = fileno(STDIN);
\&    $term     = POSIX::Termios\->new();
\&    $term\->getattr($fd_stdin);
\&    $oterm     = $term\->getlflag();
\&
\&    $echo     = ECHO | ECHOK | ICANON;
\&    $noecho   = $oterm & ~$echo;
\&
\&    sub cbreak {
\&        $term\->setlflag($noecho);  # ok, so i don\*(Aqt want echo either
\&        $term\->setcc(VTIME, 1);
\&        $term\->setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
\&    }
\&
\&    sub cooked {
\&        $term\->setlflag($oterm);
\&        $term\->setcc(VTIME, 0);
\&        $term\->setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
\&    }
\&
\&    sub readkey {
\&        my $key = \*(Aq\*(Aq;
\&        cbreak();
\&        sysread(STDIN, $key, 1);
\&        cooked();
\&        return $key;
\&    }
\&
\&    END { cooked() }
\&
\&    1;
.Ve
.SS "How do I check whether input is ready on the keyboard?"
.IX Subsection "How do I check whether input is ready on the keyboard?"
The easiest way to do this is to read a key in nonblocking mode with the
Term::ReadKey module from \s-1CPAN,\s0 passing it an argument of \-1 to indicate
not to block:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Term::ReadKey;
\&
\&    ReadMode(\*(Aqcbreak\*(Aq);
\&
\&    if (defined (my $char = ReadKey(\-1)) ) {
\&        # input was waiting and it was $char
\&    } else {
\&        # no input was waiting
\&    }
\&
\&    ReadMode(\*(Aqnormal\*(Aq);                  # restore normal tty settings
.Ve
.SS "How do I clear the screen?"
.IX Subsection "How do I clear the screen?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
To clear the screen, you just have to print the special sequence
that tells the terminal to clear the screen. Once you have that
sequence, output it when you want to clear the screen.
.PP
You can use the Term::ANSIScreen module to get the special
sequence. Import the \f(CW\*(C`cls\*(C'\fR function (or the \f(CW\*(C`:screen\*(C'\fR tag):
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Term::ANSIScreen qw(cls);
\&    my $clear_screen = cls();
\&
\&    print $clear_screen;
.Ve
.PP
The Term::Cap module can also get the special sequence if you want
to deal with the low-level details of terminal control. The \f(CW\*(C`Tputs\*(C'\fR
method returns the string for the given capability:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Term::Cap;
\&
\&    my $terminal = Term::Cap\->Tgetent( { OSPEED => 9600 } );
\&    my $clear_string = $terminal\->Tputs(\*(Aqcl\*(Aq);
\&
\&    print $clear_screen;
.Ve
.PP
On Windows, you can use the Win32::Console module. After creating
an object for the output filehandle you want to affect, call the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Cls\*(C'\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Win32::Console;
\&
\&    my $OUT = Win32::Console\->new(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
\&    my $clear_string = $OUT\->Cls;
\&
\&    print $clear_screen;
.Ve
.PP
If you have a command-line program that does the job, you can call
it in backticks to capture whatever it outputs so you can use it
later:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $clear_string = \`clear\`;
\&
\&    print $clear_string;
.Ve
.SS "How do I get the screen size?"
.IX Subsection "How do I get the screen size?"
If you have Term::ReadKey module installed from \s-1CPAN,\s0
you can use it to fetch the width and height in characters
and in pixels:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Term::ReadKey;
\&    my ($wchar, $hchar, $wpixels, $hpixels) = GetTerminalSize();
.Ve
.PP
This is more portable than the raw \f(CW\*(C`ioctl\*(C'\fR, but not as
illustrative:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    require \*(Aqsys/ioctl.ph\*(Aq;
\&    die "no TIOCGWINSZ " unless defined &TIOCGWINSZ;
\&    open(my $tty_fh, "+</dev/tty")                     or die "No tty: $!";
\&    unless (ioctl($tty_fh, &TIOCGWINSZ, $winsize=\*(Aq\*(Aq)) {
\&        die sprintf "$0: ioctl TIOCGWINSZ (%08x: $!)\en", &TIOCGWINSZ;
\&    }
\&    my ($row, $col, $xpixel, $ypixel) = unpack(\*(AqS4\*(Aq, $winsize);
\&    print "(row,col) = ($row,$col)";
\&    print "  (xpixel,ypixel) = ($xpixel,$ypixel)" if $xpixel || $ypixel;
\&    print "\en";
.Ve
.SS "How do I ask the user for a password?"
.IX Subsection "How do I ask the user for a password?"
(This question has nothing to do with the web. See a different
\&\s-1FAQ\s0 for that.)
.PP
There's an example of this in \*(L"crypt\*(R" in perlfunc). First, you put the
terminal into \*(L"no echo\*(R" mode, then just read the password normally.
You may do this with an old-style \f(CW\*(C`ioctl()\*(C'\fR function, \s-1POSIX\s0 terminal
control (see \s-1POSIX\s0 or its documentation the Camel Book), or a call
to the \fBstty\fR program, with varying degrees of portability.
.PP
You can also do this for most systems using the Term::ReadKey module
from \s-1CPAN,\s0 which is easier to use and in theory more portable.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Term::ReadKey;
\&
\&    ReadMode(\*(Aqnoecho\*(Aq);
\&    my $password = ReadLine(0);
.Ve
.SS "How do I read and write the serial port?"
.IX Subsection "How do I read and write the serial port?"
This depends on which operating system your program is running on. In
the case of Unix, the serial ports will be accessible through files in
\&\f(CW\*(C`/dev\*(C'\fR; on other systems, device names will doubtless differ.
Several problem areas common to all device interaction are the
following:
.IP "lockfiles" 4
.IX Item "lockfiles"
Your system may use lockfiles to control multiple access. Make sure
you follow the correct protocol. Unpredictable behavior can result
from multiple processes reading from one device.
.IP "open mode" 4
.IX Item "open mode"
If you expect to use both read and write operations on the device,
you'll have to open it for update (see \*(L"open\*(R" in perlfunc for
details). You may wish to open it without running the risk of
blocking by using \f(CW\*(C`sysopen()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`O_RDWR|O_NDELAY|O_NOCTTY\*(C'\fR from the
Fcntl module (part of the standard perl distribution). See
\&\*(L"sysopen\*(R" in perlfunc for more on this approach.
.IP "end of line" 4
.IX Item "end of line"
Some devices will be expecting a \*(L"\er\*(R" at the end of each line rather
than a \*(L"\en\*(R". In some ports of perl, \*(L"\er\*(R" and \*(L"\en\*(R" are different from
their usual (Unix) \s-1ASCII\s0 values of \*(L"\e015\*(R" and \*(L"\e012\*(R". You may have to
give the numeric values you want directly, using octal (\*(L"\e015\*(R"), hex
(\*(L"0x0D\*(R"), or as a control-character specification (\*(L"\ecM\*(R").
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    print DEV "atv1\e012";    # wrong, for some devices
\&    print DEV "atv1\e015";    # right, for some devices
.Ve
.Sp
Even though with normal text files a \*(L"\en\*(R" will do the trick, there is
still no unified scheme for terminating a line that is portable
between Unix, DOS/Win, and Macintosh, except to terminate \fI\s-1ALL\s0\fR line
ends with \*(L"\e015\e012\*(R", and strip what you don't need from the output.
This applies especially to socket I/O and autoflushing, discussed
next.
.IP "flushing output" 4
.IX Item "flushing output"
If you expect characters to get to your device when you \f(CW\*(C`print()\*(C'\fR them,
you'll want to autoflush that filehandle. You can use \f(CW\*(C`select()\*(C'\fR
and the \f(CW$|\fR variable to control autoflushing (see \*(L"$|\*(R" in perlvar
and \*(L"select\*(R" in perlfunc, or perlfaq5, \*(L"How do I flush/unbuffer an
output filehandle? Why must I do this?\*(R"):
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    my $old_handle = select($dev_fh);
\&    $| = 1;
\&    select($old_handle);
.Ve
.Sp
You'll also see code that does this without a temporary variable, as in
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    select((select($deb_handle), $| = 1)[0]);
.Ve
.Sp
Or if you don't mind pulling in a few thousand lines
of code just because you're afraid of a little \f(CW$|\fR variable:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use IO::Handle;
\&    $dev_fh\->autoflush(1);
.Ve
.Sp
As mentioned in the previous item, this still doesn't work when using
socket I/O between Unix and Macintosh. You'll need to hard code your
line terminators, in that case.
.IP "non-blocking input" 4
.IX Item "non-blocking input"
If you are doing a blocking \f(CW\*(C`read()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`sysread()\*(C'\fR, you'll have to
arrange for an alarm handler to provide a timeout (see
\&\*(L"alarm\*(R" in perlfunc). If you have a non-blocking open, you'll likely
have a non-blocking read, which means you may have to use a 4\-arg
\&\f(CW\*(C`select()\*(C'\fR to determine whether I/O is ready on that device (see
\&\*(L"select\*(R" in perlfunc.
.PP
While trying to read from his caller-id box, the notorious Jamie
Zawinski \f(CW\*(C`<jwz@netscape.com>\*(C'\fR, after much gnashing of teeth and
fighting with \f(CW\*(C`sysread\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sysopen\*(C'\fR, \s-1POSIX\s0's \f(CW\*(C`tcgetattr\*(C'\fR business,
and various other functions that go bump in the night, finally came up
with this:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    sub open_modem {
\&        use IPC::Open2;
\&        my $stty = \`/bin/stty \-g\`;
\&        open2( \e*MODEM_IN, \e*MODEM_OUT, "cu \-l$modem_device \-s2400 2>&1");
\&        # starting cu hoses /dev/tty\*(Aqs stty settings, even when it has
\&        # been opened on a pipe...

.SS "How do I decode encrypted password files?"
.IX Subsection "How do I decode encrypted password files?"
You spend lots and lots of money on dedicated hardware, but this is
bound to get you talked about.
.PP
Seriously, you can't if they are Unix password files\*(--the Unix
password system employs one-way encryption. It's more like hashing
than encryption. The best you can do is check whether something else
hashes to the same string. You can't turn a hash back into the
original string. Programs like Crack can forcibly (and intelligently)
try to guess passwords, but don't (can't) guarantee quick success.
.PP
If you're worried about users selecting bad passwords, you should
proactively check when they try to change their password (by modifying
\&\fIpasswd\fR\|(1), for example).
.SS "How do I start a process in the background?"
.IX Subsection "How do I start a process in the background?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
There's not a single way to run code in the background so you don't
have to wait for it to finish before your program moves on to other
tasks. Process management depends on your particular operating system,
and many of the techniques are covered in perlipc.
.PP
Several \s-1CPAN\s0 modules may be able to help, including IPC::Open2 or
IPC::Open3, IPC::Run, Parallel::Jobs,
Parallel::ForkManager, \s-1POE\s0, Proc::Background, and

If you are on a Unix-like system, you might be able to get away with a
system call where you put an \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR on the end of the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    system("cmd &")
.Ve
.PP
You can also try using \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR, as described in perlfunc (although
this is the same thing that many of the modules will do for you).
.IP "\s-1STDIN, STDOUT,\s0 and \s-1STDERR\s0 are shared" 4
.IX Item "STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are shared"
Both the main process and the backgrounded one (the \*(L"child\*(R" process)
share the same \s-1STDIN, STDOUT\s0 and \s-1STDERR\s0 filehandles. If both try to
access them at once, strange things can happen. You may want to close
or reopen these for the child. You can get around this with
\&\f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fRing a pipe (see \*(L"open\*(R" in perlfunc) but on some systems this
means that the child process cannot outlive the parent.
.IP "Signals" 4
.IX Item "Signals"
You'll have to catch the \s-1SIGCHLD\s0 signal, and possibly \s-1SIGPIPE\s0 too.
\&\s-1SIGCHLD\s0 is sent when the backgrounded process finishes. \s-1SIGPIPE\s0 is
sent when you write to a filehandle whose child process has closed (an
untrapped \s-1SIGPIPE\s0 can cause your program to silently die). This is
not an issue with \f(CW\*(C`system("cmd&")\*(C'\fR.
.IP "Zombies" 4
.IX Item "Zombies"
You have to be prepared to \*(L"reap\*(R" the child process when it finishes.
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Sp
You can also use a double fork. You immediately \f(CW\*(C`wait()\*(C'\fR for your
first child, and the init daemon will \f(CW\*(C`wait()\*(C'\fR for your grandchild once
it exits.
.Sp

Zombies are not an issue with \f(CW\*(C`system("prog &")\*(C'\fR.
.SS "How do I trap control characters/signals?"
.IX Subsection "How do I trap control characters/signals?"
You don't actually \*(L"trap\*(R" a control character. Instead, that character
generates a signal which is sent to your terminal's currently
foregrounded process group, which you then trap in your process.
Signals are documented in \*(L"Signals\*(R" in perlipc and the
section on \*(L"Signals\*(R" in the Camel.
.PP
You can set the values of the \f(CW%SIG\fR hash to be the functions you want
to handle the signal. After perl catches the signal, it looks in \f(CW%SIG\fR
for a key with the same name as the signal, then calls the subroutine
value for that key.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    # as an anonymous subroutine
\&
\&    $SIG{INT} = sub { syswrite(STDERR, "ouch\en", 5 ) };
\&
\&    # or a reference to a function
\&
\&    $SIG{INT} = \e&ouch;
\&
\&    # or the name of the function as a string
\&
\&    $SIG{INT} = "ouch";
.Ve
.PP
Perl versions before 5.8 had in its C source code signal handlers which
would catch the signal and possibly run a Perl function that you had set
in \f(CW%SIG\fR. This violated the rules of signal handling at that level
causing perl to dump core. Since version 5.8.0, perl looks at \f(CW%SIG\fR
\&\fBafter\fR the signal has been caught, rather than while it is being caught.
Previous versions of this answer were incorrect.
.SS "How do I modify the shadow password file on a Unix system?"
.IX Subsection "How do I modify the shadow password file on a Unix system?"
If perl was installed correctly and your shadow library was written
properly, the \f(CW\*(C`getpw*()\*(C'\fR functions described in perlfunc should in
theory provide (read-only) access to entries in the shadow password
file. To change the file, make a new shadow password file (the format
varies from system to system\*(--see \fIpasswd\fR\|(1) for specifics) and use
\&\f(CWpwd_mkdb(8)\fR to install it (see \fIpwd_mkdb\fR\|(8) for more details).
.SS "How do I set the time and date?"
.IX Subsection "How do I set the time and date?"
Assuming you're running under sufficient permissions, you should be
able to set the system-wide date and time by running the \f(CWdate(1)\fR
program. (There is no way to set the time and date on a per-process
basis.)  This mechanism will work for Unix, MS-DOS, Windows, and \s-1NT\s0;
the \s-1VMS\s0 equivalent is \f(CW\*(C`set time\*(C'\fR.
.PP
However, if all you want to do is change your time zone, you can
probably get away with setting an environment variable:
.PP
.Vb 3

If you want finer granularity than the 1 second that the \f(CW\*(C`sleep()\*(C'\fR
function provides, the easiest way is to use the \f(CW\*(C`select()\*(C'\fR function as
documented in \*(L"select\*(R" in perlfunc. Try the Time::HiRes and
the BSD::Itimer modules (available from \s-1CPAN,\s0 and starting from
Perl 5.8 Time::HiRes is part of the standard distribution).
.SS "How can I measure time under a second?"
.IX Xref "Time::HiRes BSD::Itimer sleep select"
.IX Subsection "How can I measure time under a second?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
The Time::HiRes module (part of the standard distribution as of
Perl 5.8) measures time with the \f(CW\*(C`gettimeofday()\*(C'\fR system call, which
returns the time in microseconds since the epoch. If you can't install
Time::HiRes for older Perls and you are on a Unixish system, you
may be able to call \f(CWgettimeofday(2)\fR directly. See
\&\*(L"syscall\*(R" in perlfunc.
.SS "How can I do an \fIatexit()\fP or \fIsetjmp()\fP/\fIlongjmp()\fP? (Exception handling)"
.IX Subsection "How can I do an atexit() or setjmp()/longjmp()? (Exception handling)"
You can use the \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR block to simulate \f(CW\*(C`atexit()\*(C'\fR. Each package's
\&\f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR block is called when the program or thread ends. See the perlmod
manpage for more details about \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR blocks.
.PP
For example, you can use this to make sure your filter program managed
to finish its output without filling up the disk:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    END {
\&        close(STDOUT) || die "stdout close failed: $!";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR block isn't called when untrapped signals kill the program,
though, so if you use \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR blocks you should also use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use sigtrap qw(die normal\-signals);
.Ve
.PP
Perl's exception-handling mechanism is its \f(CW\*(C`eval()\*(C'\fR operator. You
can use \f(CW\*(C`eval()\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR. For
details of this, see the section on signals, especially the time-out
handler for a blocking \f(CW\*(C`flock()\*(C'\fR in \*(L"Signals\*(R" in perlipc or the
section on \*(L"Signals\*(R" in \fIProgramming Perl\fR.
.PP
If exception handling is all you're interested in, use one of the
many \s-1CPAN\s0 modules that handle exceptions, such as Try::Tiny.
.PP
If you want the \f(CW\*(C`atexit()\*(C'\fR syntax (and an \f(CW\*(C`rmexit()\*(C'\fR as well), try the

.IX Subsection "Why doesn't my sockets program work under System V (Solaris)? What does the error message Protocol not supported mean?"
Some Sys-V based systems, notably Solaris 2.X, redefined some of the
standard socket constants. Since these were constant across all

In most cases, you write an external module to do it\*(--see the answer
to \*(L"Where can I learn about linking C with Perl? [h2xs, xsubpp]\*(R".
However, if the function is a system call, and your system supports

perlfunc).
.PP
Remember to check the modules that came with your distribution, and
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 as well\*(--someone may already have written a module to do it. On

.SS "Where do I get the include files to do \fIioctl()\fP or \fIsyscall()\fP?"
.IX Subsection "Where do I get the include files to do ioctl() or syscall()?"
Historically, these would be generated by the h2ph tool, part of the
standard perl distribution. This program converts \f(CWcpp(1)\fR directives
in C header files to files containing subroutine definitions, like
\&\f(CW\*(C`SYS_getitimer()\*(C'\fR, which you can use as arguments to your functions.
It doesn't work perfectly, but it usually gets most of the job done.
Simple files like \fIerrno.h\fR, \fIsyscall.h\fR, and \fIsocket.h\fR were fine,
but the hard ones like \fIioctl.h\fR nearly always need to be hand-edited.
Here's how to install the *.ph files:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    1. Become the super\-user
\&    2. cd /usr/include
\&    3. h2ph *.h */*.h
.Ve
.PP
If your system supports dynamic loading, for reasons of portability and
sanity you probably ought to use h2xs (also part of the standard perl
distribution). This tool converts C header files to Perl extensions.
See perlxstut for how to get started with h2xs.
.PP
If your system doesn't support dynamic loading, you still probably
ought to use h2xs. See perlxstut and ExtUtils::MakeMaker for
more information (in brief, just use \fBmake perl\fR instead of a plain
\&\fBmake\fR to rebuild perl with a new static extension).

The IPC::Open2 module (part of the standard perl distribution) is

.SS "Why can't I get the output of a command with \fIsystem()\fP?"
.IX Subsection "Why can't I get the output of a command with system()?"
You're confusing the purpose of \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR and backticks (``). \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR
runs a command and returns exit status information (as a 16 bit value:
the low 7 bits are the signal the process died from, if any, and
the high 8 bits are the actual exit value). Backticks (``) run a
command and return what it sent to \s-1STDOUT.\s0
.PP
.Vb 2

.SS "How can I capture \s-1STDERR\s0 from an external command?"

There are three basic ways of running external commands:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    system $cmd;        # using system()
\&    my $output = \`$cmd\`;        # using backticks (\`\`)
\&    open (my $pipe_fh, "$cmd |");    # using open()
.Ve
.PP
With \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR, both \s-1STDOUT\s0 and \s-1STDERR\s0 will go the same place as the
script's \s-1STDOUT\s0 and \s-1STDERR,\s0 unless the \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR command redirects them.
Backticks and \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR read \fBonly\fR the \s-1STDOUT\s0 of your command.
.PP
You can also use the \f(CW\*(C`open3()\*(C'\fR function from IPC::Open3. Benjamin
Goldberg provides some sample code:
.PP
To capture a program's \s-1STDOUT,\s0 but discard its \s-1STDERR:\s0
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    use IPC::Open3;
\&    use File::Spec;

\&    open(NULL, ">", File::Spec\->devnull);

\&    my $pid = open3(gensym, ">&NULL", \e*PH, "cmd");
\&    while( <PH> ) { }
\&    waitpid($pid, 0);
.Ve
.PP
To capture a program's \s-1STDERR,\s0 and let its \s-1STDOUT\s0 go to our own \s-1STDERR:\s0
.PP

\&    my $pid = open3(gensym, ">&STDERR", \e*PH, "cmd");
\&    while( <PH> ) { }
\&    waitpid($pid, 0);
.Ve
.PP
To read both a command's \s-1STDOUT\s0 and its \s-1STDERR\s0 separately, you can
redirect them to temp files, let the command run, then read the temp
files:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    use IPC::Open3;
\&    use Symbol qw(gensym);
\&    use IO::File;
\&    local *CATCHOUT = IO::File\->new_tmpfile;
\&    local *CATCHERR = IO::File\->new_tmpfile;
\&    my $pid = open3(gensym, ">&CATCHOUT", ">&CATCHERR", "cmd");
\&    waitpid($pid, 0);
\&    seek $_, 0, 0 for \e*CATCHOUT, \e*CATCHERR;
\&    while( <CATCHOUT> ) {}
\&    while( <CATCHERR> ) {}
.Ve
.PP
But there's no real need for \fBboth\fR to be tempfiles... the following
should work just as well, without deadlocking:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    use IPC::Open3;
\&    use Symbol qw(gensym);
\&    use IO::File;
\&    local *CATCHERR = IO::File\->new_tmpfile;
\&    my $pid = open3(gensym, \e*CATCHOUT, ">&CATCHERR", "cmd");
\&    while( <CATCHOUT> ) {}
\&    waitpid($pid, 0);
\&    seek CATCHERR, 0, 0;
\&    while( <CATCHERR> ) {}
.Ve
.PP
And it'll be faster, too, since we can begin processing the program's
stdout immediately, rather than waiting for the program to finish.
.PP
With any of these, you can change file descriptors before the call:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    open(STDOUT, ">logfile");
\&    system("ls");
.Ve
.PP
or you can use Bourne shell file-descriptor redirection:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $output = \`$cmd 2>some_file\`;
\&    open (PIPE, "cmd 2>some_file |");
.Ve
.PP
You can also use file-descriptor redirection to make \s-1STDERR\s0 a
duplicate of \s-1STDOUT:\s0
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $output = \`$cmd 2>&1\`;
\&    open (PIPE, "cmd 2>&1 |");
.Ve
.PP
Note that you \fIcannot\fR simply open \s-1STDERR\s0 to be a dup of \s-1STDOUT\s0
in your Perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection.
This doesn't work:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    open(STDERR, ">&STDOUT");
\&    $alloutput = \`cmd args\`;  # stderr still escapes
.Ve
.PP
This fails because the \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR makes \s-1STDERR\s0 go to where \s-1STDOUT\s0 was
going at the time of the \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR. The backticks then make \s-1STDOUT\s0 go to
a string, but don't change \s-1STDERR \s0(which still goes to the old
\&\s-1STDOUT\s0).
.PP
Note that you \fImust\fR use Bourne shell (\f(CWsh(1)\fR) redirection syntax in
backticks, not \f(CWcsh(1)\fR!  Details on why Perl's \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR and backtick

If the second argument to a piped \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR contains shell
metacharacters, perl \f(CW\*(C`fork()\*(C'\fRs, then \f(CW\*(C`exec()\*(C'\fRs a shell to decode the
metacharacters and eventually run the desired program. If the program
couldn't be run, it's the shell that gets the message, not Perl. All
your Perl program can find out is whether the shell itself could be
successfully started. You can still capture the shell's \s-1STDERR\s0 and
check it for error messages. See \*(L"How can I capture \s-1STDERR\s0 from an

If there are no shell metacharacters in the argument of \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR, Perl

.SS "What's wrong with using backticks in a void context?"
.IX Subsection "What's wrong with using backticks in a void context?"
Strictly speaking, nothing. Stylistically speaking, it's not a good
way to write maintainable code. Perl has several operators for
running external commands. Backticks are one; they collect the output
from the command for use in your program. The \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR function is
another; it doesn't do this.
.PP
Writing backticks in your program sends a clear message to the readers
of your code that you wanted to collect the output of the command.
Why send a clear message that isn't true?
.PP
Consider this line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \`cat /etc/termcap\`;

You forgot to check \f(CW$?\fR to see whether the program even ran
correctly. Even if you wrote
.PP

this code could and probably should be written as
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    system("cat /etc/termcap") == 0
\&    or die "cat program failed!";
.Ve
.PP
which will echo the cat command's output as it is generated, instead
of waiting until the program has completed to print it out. It also
checks the return value.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR also provides direct control over whether shell wildcard
processing may take place, whereas backticks do not.

This happens only if your perl is compiled to use stdio instead of
perlio, which is the default. Some (maybe all?) stdios set error and
eof flags that you may need to clear. The \s-1POSIX\s0 module defines
\&\f(CW\*(C`clearerr()\*(C'\fR that you can use. That is the technically correct way to
do it. Here are some less reliable workarounds:

Try keeping around the seekpointer and go there, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $where = tell($log_fh);
\&    seek($log_fh, $where, 0);

.IP "2." 4
If that doesn't work, try seeking to a different part of the file and
then back.
.IP "3." 4

If that doesn't work, give up on your stdio package and use sysread.

.IX Subsection "How can I convert my shell script to perl?"
Learn Perl and rewrite it. Seriously, there's no simple converter.
Things that are awkward to do in the shell are easy to do in Perl, and
this very awkwardness is what would make a shell\->perl converter
nigh-on impossible to write. By rewriting it, you'll think about what
you're really trying to do, and hopefully will escape the shell's
pipeline datastream paradigm, which while convenient for some matters,
causes many inefficiencies.

First of all note that if you're doing this for security reasons (to

To actually alter the visible command line, you can assign to the

Assuming your system supports such things, just send an appropriate signal

This is a difficult question to answer, and the best answer is
only a guess.
.PP
What do you really want to know? If you merely want to know if one of
your filehandles is connected to a terminal, you can try the \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR
file test:
.PP
.Vb 3

.Ve
.PP
However, you might be out of luck if you expect that means there is a
real person on the other side. With the Expect module, another
program can pretend to be a person. The program might even come close
to passing the Turing test.
.PP
The IO::Interactive module does the best it can to give you an
answer. Its \f(CW\*(C`is_interactive\*(C'\fR function returns an output filehandle;
that filehandle points to standard output if the module thinks the
session is interactive. Otherwise, the filehandle is a null handle
that simply discards the output:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use IO::Interactive;

This still doesn't guarantee that a real person is answering your

When you run a Perl script, something else is running the script for you,
and that something else may output error messages. The script might
emit its own warnings and error messages. Most of the time you cannot
tell who said what.
.PP
You probably cannot fix the thing that runs perl, but you can change how
perl outputs its warnings by defining a custom warning and die functions.
.PP
Consider this script, which has an error you may not notice immediately.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/locl/bin/perl

.PP
I get an error when I run this from my shell (which happens to be
bash). That may look like perl forgot it has a \f(CW\*(C`print()\*(C'\fR function,
but my shebang line is not the path to perl, so the shell runs the
script, and I get the error.
.PP
.Vb 2

A quick and dirty fix involves a little bit of code, but this may be all
you need to figure out the problem.

The perl message comes out with \*(L"Perl\*(R" in front. The \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR block

all should be in the perldiag manpage. If you don't find the error in

See the documentation for either of those commands to see what else

Perl runs \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR statement at run-time. Once Perl loads, compiles,
and runs the file, it doesn't do anything else. The \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR statement
is the same as a \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR run at compile-time, but Perl also calls the
\&\f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR method for the loaded package. These two are the same:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use MODULE qw(import list);
\&
\&    BEGIN {
\&        require MODULE;
\&        MODULE\->import(import list);
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
However, you can suppress the \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR by using an explicit, empty
import list. Both of these still happen at compile-time:
.PP
.Vb 1

\&

Since \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR will also call the \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR method, the actual value
for \f(CW\*(C`MODULE\*(C'\fR must be a bareword. That is, \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR cannot load files
by name, although \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR can:
.PP

If you want to install modules for your own use, the easiest way might
be local::lib, which you can download from \s-1CPAN.\s0 It sets various
installation settings for you, and uses those same settings within
your programs.
.PP
If you want more flexibility, you need to configure your \s-1CPAN\s0 client
for your particular situation.
.PP
For \f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR\-based distributions, use the \s-1INSTALL_BASE\s0 option
when generating Makefiles:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/mydir/perl
.Ve
.PP
You can set this in your \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR configuration so modules
automatically install in your private library directory when you use
the \s-1CPAN\s0.pm shell:

You can configure \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR to automatically use this option too:

\&\s-1INSTALL_BASE\s0 tells these tools to put your modules into

There is one caveat with \s-1INSTALL_BASE,\s0 though, since it acts
differently from the \s-1PREFIX\s0 and \s-1LIB\s0 settings that older versions of
ExtUtils::MakeMaker advocated. \s-1INSTALL_BASE\s0 does not support
installing modules for multiple versions of Perl or different
architectures under the same directory. You should consider whether you
really want that and, if you do, use the older \s-1PREFIX\s0 and \s-1LIB\s0
settings. See the ExtUtils::Makemaker documentation for more details.

.Ve
.PP
The trick in this task is to find the directory. Before your script does
anything else (such as a \f(CW\*(C`chdir\*(C'\fR), you can get the current working

.PP
You can do a similar thing with the value of \f(CW$0\fR, which holds the
script name. That might hold a relative path, but \f(CW\*(C`rel2abs\*(C'\fR can turn
it into an absolute path. Once you have the
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    BEGIN {

you can then use to construct the right library path:

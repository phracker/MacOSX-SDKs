.TH creatbyproc.d 1m  "Jun 11, 2005" "version 1.00" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
creatbyproc.d \- snoop creat()s by process name. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B creatbyproc.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
creatbyproc.d is a DTrace OneLiner to print file creations as it 
occurs, including the name of the process calling the open.

This matches file creates from the creat() system call; not all 
file creation occurs in this way, sometimes it is through open()
with a O_CREAT flag, this script will not monitor that activity.

Docs/oneliners.txt and Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt
in the DTraceToolkit contain this as a oneliner that can be cut-n-paste
to run.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

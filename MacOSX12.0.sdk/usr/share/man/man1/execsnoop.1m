.TH execsnoop 1m  "Jul 02, 2005" "version 1.20" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
execsnoop \- snoop new process execution. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B execsnoop
[\-a|\-A|\-ejhsvZ] [\-c command]
.SH DESCRIPTION
execsnoop prints details of new processes as they are executed.
Details such as UID, PID and argument listing are printed out.

This program is very useful to examine short lived processes that would
not normally appear in a prstat or "ps -ef" listing. Sometimes 
applications will run hundreds of short lived processes in their 
normal startup cycle, a behaviour that is easily monitored with execsnoop.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

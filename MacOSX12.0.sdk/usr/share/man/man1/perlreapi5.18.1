.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
As of Perl 5.9.5 there is a new interface for plugging and using
regular expression engines other than the default one.
.PP
Each engine is supposed to provide access to a constant structure of the
following format:
.PP
.Vb 10

.Ve
.PP
When a regexp is compiled, its \f(CW\*(C`engine\*(C'\fR field is then set to point at
the appropriate structure, so that when it needs to be used Perl can find
the right routines to do so.
.PP
In order to install a new regexp handler, \f(CW$^H{regcomp}\fR is set
to an integer which (when casted appropriately) resolves to one of these
structures.  When compiling, the \f(CW\*(C`comp\*(C'\fR method is executed, and the
resulting \f(CW\*(C`regexp\*(C'\fR structure's engine field is expected to point back at
the same structure.
.PP
The pTHX_ symbol in the definition is a macro used by Perl under threading
to provide an extra argument to the routine holding a pointer back to
the interpreter that is executing the regexp. So under threading all
routines get an extra argument.
.SH "Callbacks"
.IX Header "Callbacks"
.SS "comp"
.IX Subsection "comp"
.Vb 1
\&    REGEXP* comp(pTHX_ const SV * const pattern, const U32 flags);
.Ve
.PP
Compile the pattern stored in \f(CW\*(C`pattern\*(C'\fR using the given \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR and
return a pointer to a prepared \f(CW\*(C`REGEXP\*(C'\fR structure that can perform
the match.  See \*(L"The \s-1REGEXP\s0 structure\*(R" below for an explanation of
the individual fields in the \s-1REGEXP\s0 struct.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`pattern\*(C'\fR parameter is the scalar that was used as the
pattern.  Previous versions of Perl would pass two \f(CW\*(C`char*\*(C'\fR indicating
the start and end of the stringified pattern; the following snippet can
be used to get the old parameters:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    STRLEN plen;
\&    char*  exp = SvPV(pattern, plen);
\&    char* xend = exp + plen;
.Ve
.PP
Since any scalar can be passed as a pattern, it's possible to implement
an engine that does something with an array (\f(CW\*(C`"ook" =~ [ qw/ eek
hlagh / ]\*(C'\fR) or with the non-stringified form of a compiled regular
expression (\f(CW\*(C`"ook" =~ qr/eek/\*(C'\fR).  Perl's own engine will always
stringify everything using the snippet above, but that doesn't mean
other engines have to.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR parameter is a bitfield which indicates which of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`msixp\*(C'\fR flags the regex was compiled with.  It also contains
additional info, such as if \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR is in effect.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`eogc\*(C'\fR flags are stripped out before being passed to the comp
routine.  The regex engine does not need to know if any of these
are set, as those flags should only affect what Perl does with the
pattern and its match variables, not how it gets compiled and
executed.
.PP
By the time the comp callback is called, some of these flags have
already had effect (noted below where applicable).  However most of
their effect occurs after the comp callback has run, in routines that
read the \f(CW\*(C`rx\->extflags\*(C'\fR field which it populates.
.PP
In general the flags should be preserved in \f(CW\*(C`rx\->extflags\*(C'\fR after
compilation, although the regex engine might want to add or delete
some of them to invoke or disable some special behavior in Perl.  The
flags along with any special behavior they cause are documented below:
.PP
The pattern modifiers:
.ie n .IP """/m"" \- RXf_PMf_MULTILINE" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/m\fR \- RXf_PMf_MULTILINE" 4
.IX Item "/m - RXf_PMf_MULTILINE"
If this is in \f(CW\*(C`rx\->extflags\*(C'\fR it will be passed to
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_fbm_instr\*(C'\fR by \f(CW\*(C`pp_split\*(C'\fR which will treat the subject string
as a multi-line string.
.ie n .IP """/s"" \- RXf_PMf_SINGLELINE" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/s\fR \- RXf_PMf_SINGLELINE" 4
.IX Item "/s - RXf_PMf_SINGLELINE"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP """/i"" \- RXf_PMf_FOLD" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/i\fR \- RXf_PMf_FOLD" 4
.IX Item "/i - RXf_PMf_FOLD"
.ie n .IP """/x"" \- RXf_PMf_EXTENDED" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/x\fR \- RXf_PMf_EXTENDED" 4
.IX Item "/x - RXf_PMf_EXTENDED"
.PD
If present on a regex, \f(CW"#"\fR comments will be handled differently by the
tokenizer in some cases.
.Sp
\&\s-1TODO:\s0 Document those cases.
.ie n .IP """/p"" \- RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/p\fR \- RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY" 4
.IX Item "/p - RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY"
\&\s-1TODO:\s0 Document this
.IP "Character set" 4
.IX Item "Character set"
The character set semantics are determined by an enum that is contained
in this field.  This is still experimental and subject to change, but
the current interface returns the rules by use of the in-line function
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_regex_charset(const U32 flags)\*(C'\fR.  The only currently documented
value returned from it is \s-1REGEX_LOCALE_CHARSET,\s0 which is set if
\&\f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR is in effect. If present in \f(CW\*(C`rx\->extflags\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR will use the locale dependent definition of whitespace
when RXf_SKIPWHITE or RXf_WHITE is in effect.  \s-1ASCII\s0 whitespace
is defined as per isSPACE, and by the internal
macros \f(CW\*(C`is_utf8_space\*(C'\fR under \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 and \f(CW\*(C`isSPACE_LC\*(C'\fR under \f(CW\*(C`use
locale\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Additional flags:
.IP "RXf_SPLIT" 4
.IX Item "RXf_SPLIT"
This flag was removed in perl 5.18.0.  \f(CW\*(C`split \*(Aq \*(Aq\*(C'\fR is now special-cased
solely in the parser.  RXf_SPLIT is still #defined, so you can test for it.
This is how it used to work:
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR is invoked as \f(CW\*(C`split \*(Aq \*(Aq\*(C'\fR or with no arguments (which
really means \f(CW\*(C`split(\*(Aq \*(Aq, $_)\*(C'\fR, see split), Perl will
set this flag.  The regex engine can then check for it and set the
\&\s-1SKIPWHITE\s0 and \s-1WHITE\s0 extflags.  To do this, the Perl engine does:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    if (flags & RXf_SPLIT && r\->prelen == 1 && r\->precomp[0] == \*(Aq \*(Aq)
\&        r\->extflags |= (RXf_SKIPWHITE|RXf_WHITE);
.Ve
.PP
These flags can be set during compilation to enable optimizations in
the \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR operator.
.IP "RXf_SKIPWHITE" 4
.IX Item "RXf_SKIPWHITE"
This flag was removed in perl 5.18.0.  It is still #defined, so you can
set it, but doing so will have no effect.  This is how it used to work:
.Sp
If the flag is present in \f(CW\*(C`rx\->extflags\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR will delete
whitespace from the start of the subject string before it's operated
on.  What is considered whitespace depends on if the subject is a
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 string and if the \f(CW\*(C`RXf_PMf_LOCALE\*(C'\fR flag is set.
.Sp
If RXf_WHITE is set in addition to this flag, \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR will behave like
\&\f(CW\*(C`split " "\*(C'\fR under the Perl engine.
.IP "RXf_START_ONLY" 4
.IX Item "RXf_START_ONLY"
Tells the split operator to split the target string on newlines
(\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR) without invoking the regex engine.
.Sp
Perl's engine sets this if the pattern is \f(CW\*(C`/^/\*(C'\fR (\f(CW\*(C`plen == 1 && *exp
== \*(Aq^\*(Aq\*(C'\fR), even under \f(CW\*(C`/^/s\*(C'\fR; see split.  Of course a
different regex engine might want to use the same optimizations
with a different syntax.
.IP "RXf_WHITE" 4
.IX Item "RXf_WHITE"
Tells the split operator to split the target string on whitespace
without invoking the regex engine.  The definition of whitespace varies
depending on if the target string is a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 string and on
if RXf_PMf_LOCALE is set.
.Sp
Perl's engine sets this flag if the pattern is \f(CW\*(C`\es+\*(C'\fR.
.IP "RXf_NULL" 4
.IX Item "RXf_NULL"
Tells the split operator to split the target string on
characters.  The definition of character varies depending on if
the target string is a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 string.
.Sp
Perl's engine sets this flag on empty patterns, this optimization
makes \f(CW\*(C`split //\*(C'\fR much faster than it would otherwise be.  It's even
faster than \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR.
.IP "RXf_NO_INPLACE_SUBST" 4
.IX Item "RXf_NO_INPLACE_SUBST"
Added in perl 5.18.0, this flag indicates that a regular expression might
perform an operation that would interfere with inplace substituion. For
instance it might contain lookbehind, or assign to non-magical variables
(such as \f(CW$REGMARK\fR and \f(CW$REGERROR\fR) during matching.  \f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR will skip
certain optimisations when this is set.

.IX Item "rx"
The regular expression to execute.
.IP "screamer" 4
.IX Item "screamer"
This strangely-named arg is the \s-1SV\s0 to be matched against.  Note that the
actual char array to be matched against is supplied by the arguments
described below; the \s-1SV\s0 is just used to determine UTF8ness, \f(CW\*(C`pos()\*(C'\fR etc.
.IP "strbeg" 4
.IX Item "strbeg"
Pointer to the physical start of the string.
.IP "strend" 4
.IX Item "strend"
Pointer to the character following the physical end of the string (i.e.
the \f(CW\*(C`\e0\*(C'\fR).
.IP "stringarg" 4
.IX Item "stringarg"
Pointer to the position in the string where matching should start; it might
not be equal to \f(CW\*(C`strbeg\*(C'\fR (for example in a later iteration of \f(CW\*(C`/.../g\*(C'\fR).
.IP "minend" 4
.IX Item "minend"
Minimum length of string (measured in bytes from \f(CW\*(C`stringarg\*(C'\fR) that must
match; if the engine reaches the end of the match but hasn't reached this
position in the string, it should fail.
.IP "data" 4

.PP
Find the start position where a regex match should be attempted,
or possibly if the regex engine should not be run because the
pattern can't match.  This is called, as appropriate, by the core,
depending on the values of the \f(CW\*(C`extflags\*(C'\fR member of the \f(CW\*(C`regexp\*(C'\fR
structure.
.SS "checkstr"

Return a \s-1SV\s0 containing a string that must appear in the pattern. Used
by \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR for optimising matches.
.SS "free"
.IX Subsection "free"
.Vb 1
\&    void free(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);
.Ve
.PP
Called by Perl when it is freeing a regexp pattern so that the engine
can release any resources pointed to by the \f(CW\*(C`pprivate\*(C'\fR member of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`regexp\*(C'\fR structure.  This is only responsible for freeing private data;
Perl will handle releasing anything else contained in the \f(CW\*(C`regexp\*(C'\fR structure.
.SS "Numbered capture callbacks"
.IX Subsection "Numbered capture callbacks"
Called to get/set the value of \f(CW\*(C`$\`\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`$\*(Aq\*(C'\fR, \f(CW$&\fR and their named
equivalents, ${^PREMATCH}, ${^POSTMATCH} and $^{\s-1MATCH\s0}, as well as the
numbered capture groups (\f(CW$1\fR, \f(CW$2\fR, ...).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`paren\*(C'\fR parameter will be \f(CW1\fR for \f(CW$1\fR, \f(CW2\fR for \f(CW$2\fR and so
forth, and have these symbolic values for the special variables:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    ${^PREMATCH}  RX_BUFF_IDX_CARET_PREMATCH
\&    ${^POSTMATCH} RX_BUFF_IDX_CARET_POSTMATCH
\&    ${^MATCH}     RX_BUFF_IDX_CARET_FULLMATCH

\&    $\*(Aq            RX_BUFF_IDX_POSTMATCH
\&    $&            RX_BUFF_IDX_FULLMATCH
.Ve
.PP
Note that in Perl 5.17.3 and earlier, the last three constants were also
used for the caret variants of the variables.

Fetch a specified numbered capture.  \f(CW\*(C`sv\*(C'\fR should be set to the scalar
to return, the scalar is passed as an argument rather than being
returned from the function because when it's called Perl already has a
scalar to store the value, creating another one would be
redundant.  The scalar can be set with \f(CW\*(C`sv_setsv\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sv_setpvn\*(C'\fR and
friends, see perlapi.
.PP
This callback is where Perl untaints its own capture variables under
taint mode (see perlsec).  See the \f(CW\*(C`Perl_reg_numbered_buff_fetch\*(C'\fR
function in \fIregcomp.c\fR for how to untaint capture variables if
that's something you'd like your engine to do as well.

Actually Perl will not \fIalways\fR croak in a statement that looks
like it would modify a numbered capture variable.  This is because the
\&\s-1STORE\s0 callback will not be called if Perl can determine that it
doesn't have to modify the value.  This is exactly how tied variables
behave in the same situation:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package CaptureVar;

.Ve
.PP
Because \f(CW$sv\fR is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR when the \f(CW\*(C`y///\*(C'\fR operator is applied to it,
the transliteration won't actually execute and the program won't
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.  This is different to how 5.8 and earlier versions behaved
since the capture variables were \s-1READONLY\s0 variables then; now they'll
just die when assigned to in the default engine.

the result, since the length is (in Perl's case) known from an offset
stored in \f(CW\*(C`rx\->offs\*(C'\fR, this is much more efficient:

The \s-1REGEXP\s0 structure contains all the data that Perl needs to be aware of

optimisations that Perl can use to determine if the regex engine should
really be used, and various other control info that is needed to properly
execute patterns in various contexts, such as if the pattern anchored in
some way, or what flags were used during the compile, or if the
program contains special constructs that Perl needs to be aware of.

In addition it contains two fields that are intended for the private
use of the regex engine that compiled the pattern.  These are the
\&\f(CW\*(C`intflags\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`pprivate\*(C'\fR members.  \f(CW\*(C`pprivate\*(C'\fR is a void pointer to

.ie n .SS """wrapped"" ""wraplen"""
.el .SS "\f(CWwrapped\fP \f(CWwraplen\fP"
.IX Subsection "wrapped wraplen"
Stores the string \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR stringifies to. The Perl engine for example
stores \f(CW\*(C`(?^:eek)\*(C'\fR in the case of \f(CW\*(C`qr/eek/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
When using a custom engine that doesn't support the \f(CW\*(C`(?:)\*(C'\fR construct
for inline modifiers, it's probably best to have \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR stringify to
the supplied pattern, note that this will create undesired patterns in
cases such as:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $x = qr/a|b/;  # "a|b"
\&    my $y = qr/c/i;   # "c"
\&    my $z = qr/$x$y/; # "a|bc"
.Ve
.PP
There's no solution for this problem other than making the custom
engine understand a construct like \f(CW\*(C`(?:)\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS """seen_evals"""
.el .SS "\f(CWseen_evals\fP"
.IX Subsection "seen_evals"
This stores the number of eval groups in
the pattern.  This is used for security
purposes when embedding compiled regexes into larger patterns with \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS """refcnt"""
.el .SS "\f(CWrefcnt\fP"
.IX Subsection "refcnt"
The number of times the structure is referenced.  When
this falls to 0, the regexp is automatically freed
by a call to pregfree.  This should be set to 1 in
each engine's \*(L"comp\*(R" routine.

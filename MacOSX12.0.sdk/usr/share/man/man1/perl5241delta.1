.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.24.0 release and the 5.24.1
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.0, first read
perl5240delta, which describes differences between 5.22.0 and 5.24.0.
.SH "Security"
.IX Header "Security"
.SS "\fB\-Di\fP switch is now required for PerlIO debugging output"
.IX Subsection "-Di switch is now required for PerlIO debugging output"
Previously PerlIO debugging output would be sent to the file specified by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_DEBUG\*(C'\fR environment variable if perl wasn't running setuid and the
\&\fB\-T\fR or \fB\-t\fR switches hadn't been parsed yet.
.PP
If perl performed output at a point where it hadn't yet parsed its switches
this could result in perl creating or overwriting the file named by
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_DEBUG\*(C'\fR even when the \fB\-T\fR switch had been supplied.
.PP
Perl now requires the \fB\-Di\fR switch to produce PerlIO debugging output.  By
default this is written to \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR, but can optionally be redirected to a
file by setting the \f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_DEBUG\*(C'\fR environment variable.
.PP
If perl is running setuid or the \fB\-T\fR switch was supplied \f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_DEBUG\*(C'\fR is
ignored and the debugging output is sent to \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR as for any other \fB\-D\fR
switch.
.ie n .SS "Core modules and tools no longer search \fI"".""\fP for optional modules"
.el .SS "Core modules and tools no longer search \fI``.''\fP for optional modules"
.IX Subsection "Core modules and tools no longer search . for optional modules"
The tools and many modules supplied in core no longer search the default
current directory entry in \f(CW@INC\fR for optional modules.  For
example, Storable will remove the final \fI\*(L".\*(R"\fR from \f(CW@INC\fR before trying to
load Log::Agent.
.PP
This prevents an attacker injecting an optional module into a process run by
another user where the current directory is writable by the attacker, e.g. the
\&\fI/tmp\fR directory.
.PP
In most cases this removal should not cause problems, but difficulties were
encountered with base, which treats every module name supplied as optional.
These difficulties have not yet been resolved, so for this release there are no
changes to base.  We hope to have a fix for base in Perl 5.24.2.
.PP
To protect your own code from this attack, either remove the default \fI\*(L".\*(R"\fR
entry from \f(CW@INC\fR at the start of your script, so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  #!/usr/bin/perl
\&  use strict;
\&  ...
.Ve
.PP
becomes:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  #!/usr/bin/perl
\&  BEGIN { pop @INC if $INC[\-1] eq \*(Aq.\*(Aq }
\&  use strict;
\&  ...
.Ve
.PP
or for modules, remove \fI\*(L".\*(R"\fR from a localized \f(CW@INC\fR, so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $can_foo = eval { require Foo; }
.Ve
.PP
becomes:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  my $can_foo = eval {
\&      local @INC = @INC;
\&      pop @INC if $INC[\-1] eq \*(Aq.\*(Aq;
\&      require Foo;
\&  };

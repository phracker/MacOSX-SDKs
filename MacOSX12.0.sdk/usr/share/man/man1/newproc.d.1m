.B newproc.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
newproc.d is a DTrace OneLiner to snoop new processes as they are run.
The argument listing is printed.

This is useful to identify short lived processes that are usually
difficult to spot using traditional tools.

Docs/oneliners.txt and Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt
in the DTraceToolkit contain this as a oneliner that can be cut-n-paste
to run.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

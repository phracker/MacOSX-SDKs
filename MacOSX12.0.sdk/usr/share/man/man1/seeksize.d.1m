.TH seeksize.d 1m  "May 14, 2005" "version 0.95" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
seeksize.d \- print disk event seek report. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B seeksize.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
seeksize.d is a simple DTrace program to print a report of disk
event seeks by process. 

This can be used to identify whether processes are accessing the
disks in a "random" or "sequential" manner. Sequential is often
desirable, indicated by mostly zero length seeks.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

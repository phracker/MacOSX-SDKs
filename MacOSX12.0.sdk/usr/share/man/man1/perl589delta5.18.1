.SH "NAME"
perl589delta \- what is new for perl v5.8.9
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.8.8 release and
the 5.8.9 release.
.SH "Notice"
.IX Header "Notice"
The 5.8.9 release will be the last significant release of the 5.8.x
series. Any future releases of 5.8.x will likely only be to deal with
security issues, and platform build failures. Hence you should look to
migrating to 5.10.x, if you have not started already.
See \*(L"Known Problems\*(R" for more information.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
A particular construction in the source code of extensions written in \*(C+
may need changing. See \*(L"Changed Internals\*(R" for more details. All
extensions written in C, most written in \*(C+, and all existing compiled
extensions are unaffected. This was necessary to improve \*(C+ support.
.PP
Other than this, there are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.8.8.
If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "Unicode Character Database 5.1.0."
.IX Subsection "Unicode Character Database 5.1.0."
The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has
been updated to 5.1.0 from 4.1.0. See
<http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/#NotableChanges> for the
notable changes.
.SS "stat and \-X on directory handles"
.IX Subsection "stat and -X on directory handles"
It is now possible to call \f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`\-X\*(C'\fR filestat operators on
directory handles. As both directory and file handles are barewords, there
can be ambiguities over which was intended. In these situations the file
handle semantics are preferred. Both also treat \f(CW*FILE{IO}\fR filehandles
like \f(CW*FILE\fR filehandles.
.ie n .SS "Source filters in @INC"
.el .SS "Source filters in \f(CW@INC\fP"
.IX Subsection "Source filters in @INC"
It's possible to enhance the mechanism of subroutine hooks in \f(CW@INC\fR by
adding a source filter on top of the filehandle opened and returned by the
hook. This feature was planned a long time ago, but wasn't quite working
until now. See \*(L"require\*(R" in perlfunc for details. (Nicholas Clark)
.SS "Exceptions in constant folding"
.IX Subsection "Exceptions in constant folding"
The constant folding routine is now wrapped in an exception handler, and
if folding throws an exception (such as attempting to evaluate 0/0), perl
now retains the current optree, rather than aborting the whole program.
Without this change, programs would not compile if they had expressions that
happened to generate exceptions, even though those expressions were in code
that could never be reached at runtime. (Nicholas Clark, Dave Mitchell)
.ie n .SS """no VERSION"""
.el .SS "\f(CWno VERSION\fP"
.IX Subsection "no VERSION"
You can now use \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR followed by a version number to specify that you
want to use a version of perl older than the specified one.
.SS "Improved internal \s-1UTF\-8\s0 caching code"
.IX Subsection "Improved internal UTF-8 caching code"
The code that caches calculated \s-1UTF\-8\s0 byte offsets for character offsets for
a string has been re-written. Several bugs have been located and eliminated,
and the code now makes better use of the information it has, so should be
faster. In particular, it doesn't scan to the end of a string before
calculating an offset within the string, which should speed up some operations
on long strings. It is now possible to disable the caching code at run time,
to verify that it is not the cause of suspected problems.
.SS "Runtime relocatable installations"
.IX Subsection "Runtime relocatable installations"
There is now \fIConfigure\fR support for creating a perl tree that is relocatable
at run time. see \*(L"Relocatable installations\*(R".
.SS "New internal variables"
.IX Subsection "New internal variables"
.ie n .IP """${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}\fR" 4
.IX Item "${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}"
This variable gives the native status returned by the last pipe close,
backtick command, successful call to \f(CW\*(C`wait\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`waitpid\*(C'\fR, or from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR operator. See perlvar for details. (Contributed by Gisle Aas.)
.ie n .IP """${^UTF8CACHE}""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW${^UTF8CACHE}\fR" 4
.IX Item "${^UTF8CACHE}"
This variable controls the state of the internal \s-1UTF\-8\s0 offset caching code.
1 for on (the default), 0 for off, \-1 to debug the caching code by checking
all its results against linear scans, and panicking on any discrepancy.
.ie n .SS """readpipe"" is now overridable"
.el .SS "\f(CWreadpipe\fP is now overridable"
.IX Subsection "readpipe is now overridable"
The built-in function \f(CW\*(C`readpipe\*(C'\fR is now overridable. Overriding it permits
also to override its operator counterpart, \f(CW\*(C`qx//\*(C'\fR (also known as \f(CW\*(C`\`\`\*(C'\fR).
.SS "simple exception handling macros"
.IX Subsection "simple exception handling macros"
Perl 5.8.9 (and 5.10.0 onwards) now provides a couple of macros to do very
basic exception handling in \s-1XS\s0 modules. You can use these macros if you call
code that may \f(CW\*(C`croak\*(C'\fR, but you need to do some cleanup before giving control
back to Perl. See \*(L"Exception Handling\*(R" in perlguts for more details.

.SS "XS-assisted \s-1SWASHGET\s0"
.IX Subsection "XS-assisted SWASHGET"
Some pure-perl code that the regexp engine was using to retrieve Unicode
properties and transliteration mappings has been reimplemented in \s-1XS\s0
for faster execution.
(\s-1SADAHIRO\s0 Tomoyuki)
.SS "Constant subroutines"
.IX Subsection "Constant subroutines"
The interpreter internals now support a far more memory efficient form of
inlineable constants. Storing a reference to a constant value in a symbol
table is equivalent to a full typeglob referencing a constant subroutine,
but using about 400 bytes less memory. This proxy constant subroutine is
automatically upgraded to a real typeglob with subroutine if necessary.
The approach taken is analogous to the existing space optimisation for
subroutine stub declarations, which are stored as plain scalars in place
of the full typeglob.
.PP
However, to aid backwards compatibility of existing code, which (wrongly)
does not expect anything other than typeglobs in symbol tables, nothing in
core uses this feature, other than the regression tests.
.PP
Stubs for prototyped subroutines have been stored in symbol tables as plain
strings, and stubs for unprototyped subroutines as the number \-1, since 5.005,
so code which assumes that the core only places typeglobs in symbol tables
has been making incorrect assumptions for over 10 years.

.IP "\(bu" 4
The default since perl 5.000 has been for perl to create an empty scalar
with every new typeglob. The increased use of lexical variables means that
most are now unused. Thanks to Nicholas Clark's efforts, Perl can now be
compiled with \f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV\*(C'\fR to avoid creating these empty scalars.
This will significantly decrease the number of scalars allocated for all
configurations, and the number of scalars that need to be copied for ithread
creation. Whilst this option is binary compatible with existing perl
installations, it does change a long-standing assumption about the
internals, hence it is not enabled by default, as some third party code may
rely on the old behaviour.
.Sp
We would recommend testing with this configuration on new deployments of
perl, particularly for multi-threaded servers, to see whether all third party
code is compatible with it, as this configuration may give useful performance
improvements. For existing installations we would not recommend changing to
this configuration unless thorough testing is performed before deployment.

Regular expressions classes of a single character are now treated the same as

.IP "\(bu" 4
Creating anonymous array and hash references (ie. \f(CW\*(C`[]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR) now incurs
no more overhead than creating an anonymous list or hash. Nicholas Clark
provided changes with a saving of two ops and one stack push, which was measured
as a slightly better than 5% improvement for these operations.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Many calls to \f(CW\*(C`strlen()\*(C'\fR have been eliminated, either because the length was
already known, or by adopting or enhancing APIs that pass lengths. This has
been aided by the adoption of a \f(CW\*(C`my_sprintf()\*(C'\fR wrapper, which returns the
correct C89 value \- the length of the formatted string. Previously we could
not rely on the return value of \f(CW\*(C`sprintf()\*(C'\fR, because on some ancient but

There is now \fIConfigure\fR support for creating a relocatable perl tree. If

At start time, if any paths in \f(CW@INC\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Config\*(C'\fR that \fIConfigure\fR marked
as relocatable (by starting them with \f(CW".../"\fR), then they are prefixed the

.SS "Reblessing overloaded objects now works"
.IX Subsection "Reblessing overloaded objects now works"
Internally, perl object-ness is on the referent, not the reference, even
though methods can only be called via a reference. However, the original
implementation of overloading stored flags related to overloading on the
reference, relying on the flags being copied when the reference was copied,
or set at the creation of a new reference. This manifests in a bug \- if you
rebless an object from a class that has overloading, into one that does not,
then any other existing references think that they (still) point to an
overloaded object, choose these C code paths, and then throw errors.
Analogously, blessing into an overloaded class when other references exist will
result in them not using overloading.
.PP
The implementation has been fixed for 5.10, but this fix changes the semantics
of flag bits, so is not binary compatible, so can't be applied to 5.8.9.
However, 5.8.9 has a work-around that implements the same bug fix. If the
referent has multiple references, then all the other references are located and
corrected. A full search is avoided whenever possible by scanning lexicals
outwards from the current subroutine, and the argument stack.
.PP
A certain well known Linux vendor applied incomplete versions of this bug fix
to their \fI/usr/bin/perl\fR and then prematurely closed bug reports about
performance issues without consulting back upstream. This not being enough,
they then proceeded to ignore the necessary fixes to these unreleased changes
for 11 months, until massive pressure was applied by their long-suffering
paying customers, catalysed by the failings being featured on a prominent blog
and Slashdot.

A \f(CW\*(C`Perl_signbit()\*(C'\fR function was added to test the sign of an \f(CW\*(C`NV\*(C'\fR. It 
maps to the system one when available.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_av_reify()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Perl_lex_end()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Perl_mod()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Perl_op_clear()\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_pop_return()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Perl_qerror()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Perl_setdefout()\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_vivify_defelem()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Perl_yylex()\*(C'\fR are now visible to extensions.
This was required to allow \f(CW\*(C`Data::Alias\*(C'\fR to work on Windows.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_find_runcv()\*(C'\fR is now visible to perl core extensions. This was required
to allow \f(CW\*(C`Sub::Current\*(C'\fR to work on Windows.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`ptr_table*\*(C'\fR functions are now available in unthreaded perl. \f(CW\*(C`Storable\*(C'\fR
takes advantage of this.
.PP
There have been many small cleanups made to the internals. In particular,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_sv_upgrade()\*(C'\fR has been simplified considerably, with a straight-through
code path that uses \f(CW\*(C`memset()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memcpy()\*(C'\fR to initialise the new body,
rather than assignment via multiple temporary variables. It has also
benefited from simplification and de-duplication of the arena management
code.
.PP
A lot of small improvements in the code base were made due to reports from
the Coverity static code analyzer.
.PP
Corrected use and documentation of \f(CW\*(C`Perl_gv_stashpv()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Perl_gv_stashpvn()\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_gv_stashsv()\*(C'\fR functions (last parameter is a bitmask, not boolean).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_SYS_INIT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PERL_SYS_INIT3\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PERL_SYS_TERM\*(C'\fR macros have been
changed into functions.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERLSYS_TERM\*(C'\fR no longer requires a context. \f(CW\*(C`PerlIO_teardown()\*(C'\fR
is now called without a context, and debugging output in this function has
been disabled because that required that an interpreter was present, an invalid
assumption at termination time.
.PP
All compile time options which affect binary compatibility have been grouped
together into a global variable (\f(CW\*(C`PL_bincompat_options\*(C'\fR).
.PP
The values of \f(CW\*(C`PERL_REVISION\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PERL_VERSION\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PERL_SUBVERSION\*(C'\fR are
now baked into global variables (and hence into any shared perl library).
Additionally under \f(CW\*(C`MULTIPLICITY\*(C'\fR, the perl executable now records the size of
the interpreter structure (total, and for this version). Coupled with
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_bincompat_options\*(C'\fR this will allow 5.8.10 (and later), when compiled with a
shared perl library, to perform sanity checks in \f(CW\*(C`main()\*(C'\fR to verify that the
shared library is indeed binary compatible.
.PP
Symbolic references can now have embedded NULs. The new public function
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_get_cvn_flags()\*(C'\fR can be used in extensions if you have to handle them.
.SS "Macro cleanups"
.IX Subsection "Macro cleanups"
The core code, and \s-1XS\s0 code in \fIext\fR that is not dual-lived on \s-1CPAN,\s0 no longer
uses the macros \f(CW\*(C`PL_na\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`NEWSV()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Null()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Nullav\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Nullcv\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Nullhv\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Nullhv\*(C'\fR \fIetc\fR. Their use is discouraged in new code,
particularly \f(CW\*(C`PL_na\*(C'\fR, which is a small performance hit.

.SH "Known Problems"
.IX Header "Known Problems"
There are no known new bugs.
.PP
However, programs that rely on bugs that have been fixed will have problems.
Also, many bug fixes present in 5.10.0 can't be back-ported to the 5.8.x
branch, because they require changes that are binary incompatible, or because
the code changes are too large and hence too risky to incorporate.
.PP
We have only limited volunteer labour, and the maintenance burden is
getting increasingly complex. Hence this will be the last significant
release of the 5.8.x series. Any future releases of 5.8.x will likely
only be to deal with security issues, and platform build
failures. Hence you should look to migrating to 5.10.x, if you have
not started already. Alternatively, if business requirements constrain
you to continue to use 5.8.x, you may wish to consider commercial
support from firms such as ActiveState.

Nick Ing-Simmons, long time Perl hacker, author of the \f(CW\*(C`Tk\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Encode\*(C'\fR

Some of the work in this release was funded by a \s-1TPF\s0 grant.
.PP
Steve Hay worked behind the scenes working out the causes of the differences
between core modules, their \s-1CPAN\s0 releases, and previous core releases, and
the best way to rectify them. He doesn't want to do it again. I know this
feeling, and I'm very glad he did it this time, instead of me.
.PP
Paul Fenwick assembled a team of 18 volunteers, who broke the back of writing
this document. In particular, Bradley Dean, Eddy Tan, and Vincent Pit
provided half the team's contribution.
.PP
Schwern verified the list of updated module versions, correcting quite a few
errors that I (and everyone else) had missed, both wrongly stated module
versions, and changed modules that had not been listed.
.PP
The crack Berlin-based \s-1QA\s0 team of Andreas Ko\*:nig and Slaven Rezic
tirelessly re-built snapshots, tested most everything \s-1CPAN\s0 against
them, and then identified the changes responsible for any module regressions,
ensuring that several show-stopper bugs were stomped before the first release
candidate was cut.
.PP
The other core committers contributed most of the changes, and applied most
of the patches sent in by the hundreds of contributors listed in \fI\s-1AUTHORS\s0\fR.
.PP
And obviously, Larry Wall, without whom we wouldn't have Perl.
.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://bugs.perl.org.  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the \fBperlbug\fR
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search
the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security
issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on \s-1CPAN.\s0

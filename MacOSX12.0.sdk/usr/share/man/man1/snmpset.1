.TH SNMPSET 1 "19 Jun 2003" V5.6.2.1 "Net-SNMP"
.SH NAME
snmpset - communicates with a network entity using SNMP SET requests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpset
[COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT OID TYPE VALUE [OID TYPE VALUE]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpset
is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP SET request to set
information on a network entity.  One or more object identifiers
(OIDs) must be given as arguments on the command line.  A type and a
value to be set must accompany each object identifier.  Each variable
name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables(5) .
.PP
The
.I TYPE
is a single character, one of:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 3
.B i
INTEGER
.TP 3
.B u
UNSIGNED
.TP 3
.B s
STRING
.TP 3
.B x
HEX STRING
.TP 3
.B d
DECIMAL STRING
.TP 3
.B n
NULLOBJ
.TP 3
.B o
OBJID
.TP 3
.B t
TIMETICKS
.TP 3
.B a
IPADDRESS
.TP 3
.B b
BITS
.PD
.RE
Most of these will use the obvious corresponding ASN.1 type.
\&'s', 'x', 'd' and 'b' are all different ways of specifying an OCTET STRING
value, and the 'u' unsigned type is also used for handling Gauge32 values.
.PP
If you have the proper MIB file loaded, you can, in most cases, replace the
type with an '=' sign. For an object of type OCTET STRING this will assume
a string like the 's' type notation. For other types it will do "The
Right Thing".
.PP
For example:
.PP
snmpset -c private -v 1 test-hub system.sysContact.0 s dpz@noc.rutgers.edu ip.ipforwarding.0 = 2
.PP
will set the variables sysContact.0 and ipForwarding.0:
.PP
system.sysContact.0 = STRING: "dpz@noc.rutgers.edu"
.br
ip.ipForwarding.0 = INTEGER: not-forwarding(2)
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
pinpoint in what way the request was malformed.
.SH OPTIONS
.B snmpset
takes the common options described in the
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page.
Note that
.B snmpset
REQUIRES  an argument specifying the agent to query
and at least one set of OID/type/value arguments, as described in there.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
snmpcmd(1), variables(5).

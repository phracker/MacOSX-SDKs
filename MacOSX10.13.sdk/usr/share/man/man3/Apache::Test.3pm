Apache::Test \- Test.pm wrapper with helpers for testing Apache
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&    use Apache::Test;
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBApache::Test\fR is a wrapper around the standard \f(CW\*(C`Test.pm\*(C'\fR with
helpers for testing an Apache server.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
.IP "plan" 4
.IX Item "plan"
This function is a wrapper around \f(CW\*(C`Test::plan\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    plan tests => 3;
.Ve
.Sp
just like using Test.pm, plan 3 tests.
.Sp
If the first argument is an object, such as an \f(CW\*(C`Apache::RequestRec\*(C'\fR
object, \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR will be tied to it. The \f(CW\*(C`Test.pm\*(C'\fR global state will
also be refreshed by calling \f(CW\*(C`Apache::Test::test_pm_refresh\*(C'\fR. For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    plan $r, tests => 7;
.Ve
.Sp
ties \s-1STDOUT\s0 to the request object \f(CW$r\fR.
.Sp
If there is a last argument that doesn't belong to \f(CW\*(C`Test::plan\*(C'\fR
(which expects a balanced hash), it's used to decide whether to
continue with the test or to skip it all-together. This last argument
can be:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
a \f(CW\*(C`SCALAR\*(C'\fR
.Sp
the test is skipped if the scalar has a false value. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  plan tests => 5, 0;
.Ve
.Sp
But this won't hint the reason for skipping therefore it's better to
use \fIneed()\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  plan tests => 5,
\&      need \*(AqLWP\*(Aq,
\&           { "not Win32" => sub { $^O eq \*(AqMSWin32\*(Aq} };
.Ve
.Sp
see \f(CW\*(C`need()\*(C'\fR for more info.
.IP "\(bu" 4
an \f(CW\*(C`ARRAY\*(C'\fR reference
.Sp
\&\fIneed_module()\fR is called for each value in this array. The test is
skipped if \fIneed_module()\fR returns false (which happens when at least
one C or Perl module from the list cannot be found).
.Sp
Watch out for case insensitive file systems or duplicate modules
with the same name.  I.E.  If you mean mod_env.c
   need_module('mod_env.c')
Not
   need_module('env')
.IP "\(bu" 4
a \f(CW\*(C`CODE\*(C'\fR reference
.Sp
the tests will be skipped if the function returns a false value. For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    plan tests => 5, need_lwp;
.Ve
.Sp
the test will be skipped if \s-1LWP\s0 is not available
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
All other arguments are passed through to \fITest::plan\fR as is.
.RE
.IP "ok" 4
.IX Item "ok"
Same as \fITest::ok\fR, see \fITest.pm\fR documentation.
.IP "sok" 4
.IX Item "sok"
Allows to skip a sub-test, controlled from the command line.  The
argument to \fIsok()\fR is a \s-1CODE\s0 reference or a \s-1BLOCK\s0 whose return value
will be passed to \fIok()\fR. By default behaves like \fIok()\fR. If all sub-tests
of the same test are written using \fIsok()\fR, and a test is executed as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  % ./t/TEST \-v skip_subtest 1 3
.Ve
.Sp
only sub-tests 1 and 3 will be run, the rest will be skipped.
.IP "skip" 4
.IX Item "skip"
Same as \fITest::skip\fR, see \fITest.pm\fR documentation.
.IP "test_pm_refresh" 4
.IX Item "test_pm_refresh"
Normally called by \fIApache::Test::plan\fR, this function will refresh
the global state maintained by \fITest.pm\fR, allowing \f(CW\*(C`plan\*(C'\fR and
friends to be called more than once per-process.  This function is not
exported.
.PP
Functions that can be used as a last argument to the extended \fIplan()\fR.
Note that for each \f(CW\*(C`need_*\*(C'\fR function there is a \f(CW\*(C`have_*\*(C'\fR equivalent
that performs the exact same function except that it is designed to
be used outside of \f(CW\*(C`plan()\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`need_*\*(C'\fR functions have the side effect
of generating skip messages, if the test is skipped.  \f(CW\*(C`have_*\*(C'\fR functions
don't have this side effect.  In other words, use \f(CW\*(C`need_apache()\*(C'\fR
with \f(CW\*(C`plan()\*(C'\fR to decide whether a test will run, but \f(CW\*(C`have_apache()\*(C'\fR
within test logic to adjust expectations based on older or newer
server versions.

.Sp
\&\fIneed()\fR is more generic function which can impose multiple requirements
at once. All requirements must be satisfied.
.Sp
\&\fIneed()\fR's argument is a list of things to test. The list can include
scalars, which are passed to \fIneed_module()\fR, and hash references. If
hash references are used, the keys, are strings, containing a reason
for a failure to satisfy this particular entry, the values are the
condition, which are satisfaction if they return true. If the value is
0 or 1, it used to decide whether the requirements very satisfied, so
you can mix special \f(CW\*(C`need_*()\*(C'\fR functions that return 0 or 1. For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  plan tests => 1, need \*(AqCompress::Zlib\*(Aq, \*(Aqdeflate\*(Aq,
\&      need_min_apache_version("2.0.49");
.Ve
.Sp
If the scalar value is a string, different from 0 or 1, it's passed to
\&\fI\fIneed_module()\fI\fR.  If the value is a code reference, it gets executed
at the time of check and its return value is used to check the
condition. If the condition check fails, the provided (in a key)
reason is used to tell user why the test was skipped.
.Sp
In the presented example, we require the presence of the \f(CW\*(C`LWP\*(C'\fR Perl
module, \f(CW\*(C`mod_cgid\*(C'\fR, that we run under perl >= 5.7.3 on Win32.
.Sp
It's possible to put more than one requirement into a single hash
reference, but be careful that the keys will be different.
.Sp
It's also important to mention to avoid using:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  plan tests => 1, requirement1 && requirement2;
.Ve
.Sp
technique. While test-wise that technique is equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  plan tests => 1, need requirement1, requirement2;
.Ve
.Sp
since the test will be skipped, unless all the rules are satisfied,
it's not equivalent for the end users. The second technique, deploying
\&\f(CW\*(C`need()\*(C'\fR and a list of requirements, always runs all the requirement
checks and reports all the missing requirements. In the case of the
first technique, if the first requirement fails, the second is not
run, and the missing requirement is not reported. So let's say all the
requirements are missing Apache modules, and a user wants to satisfy
all of these and run the test suite again. If all the unsatisfied
requirements are reported at once, she will need to rebuild Apache
once. If only one requirement is reported at a time, she will have to
rebuild Apache as many times as there are elements in the \f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR
statement.

.SH "Test::More Integration"
.IX Header "Test::More Integration"
There are a few caveats if you want to use \fIApache::Test\fR with
\&\fITest::More\fR instead of the default \fITest\fR backend.  The first is
that \fITest::More\fR requires you to use its own \f(CW\*(C`plan()\*(C'\fR function
and not the one that ships with \fIApache::Test\fR.  \fITest::More\fR also
defines \f(CW\*(C`ok()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`skip()\*(C'\fR functions that are different, and
simply \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fRing both modules in your test script will lead to redefined
warnings for these subroutines.
.PP
To assist \fITest::More\fR users we have created a special \fIApache::Test\fR
import tag, \f(CW\*(C`:withtestmore\*(C'\fR, which will export all of the standard
\&\fIApache::Test\fR symbols into your namespace except the ones that collide
with \fITest::More\fR.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Apache::Test qw(:withtestmore);
\&    use Test::More;
\&
\&    plan tests => 1;           # Test::More::plan()
\&
\&    ok (\*(Aqyes\*(Aq, \*(Aqtesting ok\*(Aq);  # Test::More::ok()
.Ve
.PP
Now, while this works fine for standard client-side tests
(such as \f(CW\*(C`t/basic.t\*(C'\fR), the more advanced features of \fIApache::Test\fR
require using \fITest::More\fR as the sole driver behind the scenes.
.PP
Should you choose to use \fITest::More\fR as the backend for
server-based tests (such as \f(CW\*(C`t/response/TestMe/basic.pm\*(C'\fR) you will
need to use the \f(CW\*(C`\-withtestmore\*(C'\fR action tag:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Apache::Test qw(\-withtestmore);
\&
\&    sub handler {
\&
\&        my $r = shift;
\&
\&        plan $r, tests => 1;           # Test::More::plan() with
\&                                       # Apache::Test features
\&
\&        ok (\*(Aqyes\*(Aq, \*(Aqtesting ok\*(Aq);      # Test::More::ok()
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-withtestmore\*(C'\fR tells \fIApache::Test\fR to use \fITest::More\fR
instead of \fITest.pm\fR behind the scenes.  Note that you are not
required to \f(CW\*(C`use Test::More\*(C'\fR yourself with the \f(CW\*(C`\-withtestmore\*(C'\fR
option and that the \f(CW\*(C`use Test::More tests => 1\*(C'\fR syntax
may have unexpected results.
.PP
Note that \fITest::More\fR version 0.49, available within the
\&\fITest::Simple\fR 0.49 distribution on \s-1CPAN,\s0 or greater is required
to use this feature.
.PP
Because \fIApache:Test\fR was initially developed using \fITest\fR as
the framework driver, complete \fITest::More\fR integration is
considered experimental at this time \- it is supported as best as
possible but is not guaranteed to be as stable as the default \fITest\fR
interface at this time.
.SH "Apache::TestToString Class"
.IX Header "Apache::TestToString Class"
The \fIApache::TestToString\fR class is used to capture \fITest.pm\fR output
into a string.  Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Apache::TestToString\->start;
\&
\&    plan tests => 4;
\&
\&    ok $data eq \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq;
\&
\&    ...
\&
\&    # $tests will contain the Test.pm output: 1..4\enok 1\en...
\&    my $tests = Apache::TestToString\->finish;

Apache::TestRequest subclasses LWP::UserAgent and
exports a number of useful functions for sending request to the Apache test
server. You can then test the results of those requests.

Use Apache::TestMM in your \fIMakefile.PL\fR to set up your
distribution for testing.

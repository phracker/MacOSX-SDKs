.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dmc(1) configures the Disk Mount Conditioner\. The Disk Mount Conditioner is a kernel provided service that can degrade the disk I/O being issued to specific mount points, providing the illusion that the I/O is executing on a slower device\. It can also cause the conditioned mount point to advertise itself as a different device type, e\.g\. the disk type of an SSD could be set to an HDD\. This behavior consequently changes various parameters such as read\-ahead settings, disk I/O throttling, etc\., which normally have different behavior depending on the underlying device type\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
Common command parameters:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fImount\fR \- the mount point to be used in the command
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIprofile\-name\fR \- the name of a profile as shown in \fBdmc list\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIprofile\-index\fR \- the index of a profile as shown in \fBdmc list\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fBdmc start\fR \fImount\fR [\fIprofile\-name\fR|\fIprofile\-index\fR]
.
.br
\~\~\~\~Start the Disk Mount Conditioner on the given mount point with the current settings (from \fBdmc status\fR) or the given profile, if provided\.
.
.P
\fBdmc stop\fR \fImount\fR
.
.br
\~\~\~\~Disable the Disk Mount Conditioner on the given mount point
.
.P
\fBdmc status\fR \fImount\fR [\-json]
.
.br
\~\~\~\~Display the current settings (including on/off state), optionally as JSON
.
.P
\fBdmc show\fR \fIprofile\-name\fR|\fIprofile\-index\fR
.
.br
\~\~\~\~Display the settings of the given profile
.
.P
\fBdmc list\fR
.
.br
\~\~\~\~Display all profile names and indices
.
.P
\fBdmc select\fR \fImount\fR \fIprofile\-name\fR|\fIprofile\-index\fR
.
.br
\~\~\~\~Choose a different profile for the given mount point without enabling or disabling the Disk Mount Conditioner
.
.P
\fBdmc configure\fR \fImount\fR \fItype\fR \fIaccess\-time\fR \fIread\-throughput\fR \fIwrite\-throughput\fR
.
.br
\~\~\~\~Select custom parameters for the given mount point rather than using the settings provided by a default profile\.
.
.P
\~\~\~\~See \fBdmc list\fR for example parameter settings for various disk presets\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fItype\fR \- \'SSD\' or \'HDD\'\. The type determines how various system behaviors like disk I/O throttling and read\-ahead algorithms affect the issued I/O\. Additionally, choosing \'HDD\' will attempt to simulate seek times, including drive spin\-up from idle\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIaccess\-time\fR \- latency in microseconds for a single I/O\. For SSD types this latency is applied exactly as specified to all I/O\. For HDD types, the latency scales based on a simulated seek time (thus making the access\-time the maximum latency or seek penalty)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIread\-throughput\fR \- integer specifying megabytes\-per\-second maximum throughput for disk reads
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIwrite\-throughput\fR \- integer specifying megabytes\-per\-second maxmimu throughput for disk writes
.
.IP "" 0

.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBdmc start / \'5400 HDD\'\fR
.
.P
\~\~\~\~Turn on the Disk Mount Conditioner for the boot volume, acting like a 5400 RPM hard drive\.
.
.P
\fBdmc configure /Volumes/ExtDisk SSD 100 100 50\fR
.
.P
\~\~\~\~Configure an external disk to use custom parameters to degrade performance as if it were a slow SSD with 100 microsecond latencies, 100MB/s read throughput, and 50MB/s write throughput\.
.
.SH "IMPORTANT"
The Disk Mount Conditioner is not a \'simulator\'\. It can only degrade (or \'condition\') the I/O such that a faster disk device behaves like a slower device, not vice\-versa\. For example, a 5400 RPM hard drive cannot be conditioned to act like a SSD that is capable of a higher throughput than the theoretical limitations of the hard disk\.
.
.P
In addition to running \fBdmc stop\fR, rebooting is also a sufficient way to clear any existing settings and disable Disk Mount Conditioner on all mount points\.

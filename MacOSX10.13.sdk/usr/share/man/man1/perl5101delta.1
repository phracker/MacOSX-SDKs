.SH "NAME"
perl5101delta \- what is new for perl v5.10.1
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.10.0 release and
the 5.10.1 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.8.8, first read
the perl5100delta, which describes differences between 5.8.8 and
5.10.0
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Switch statement changes"
.IX Subsection "Switch statement changes"
The handling of complex expressions by the \f(CW\*(C`given\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`when\*(C'\fR switch
statement has been enhanced. There are two new cases where \f(CW\*(C`when\*(C'\fR now
interprets its argument as a boolean, instead of an expression to be used
in a smart match:
.IP "flip-flop operators" 4
.IX Item "flip-flop operators"
The \f(CW\*(C`..\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`...\*(C'\fR flip-flop operators are now evaluated in boolean
context, following their usual semantics; see \*(L"Range Operators\*(R" in perlop.
.Sp
Note that, as in perl 5.10.0, \f(CW\*(C`when (1..10)\*(C'\fR will not work to test
whether a given value is an integer between 1 and 10; you should use
\&\f(CW\*(C`when ([1..10])\*(C'\fR instead (note the array reference).
.Sp
However, contrary to 5.10.0, evaluating the flip-flop operators in boolean
context ensures it can now be useful in a \f(CW\*(C`when()\*(C'\fR, notably for
implementing bistable conditions, like in:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) {
\&      # do something
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "defined-or operator" 4
.IX Item "defined-or operator"
A compound expression involving the defined-or operator, as in
\&\f(CW\*(C`when (expr1 // expr2)\*(C'\fR, will be treated as boolean if the first
expression is boolean. (This just extends the existing rule that applies
to the regular or operator, as in \f(CW\*(C`when (expr1 || expr2)\*(C'\fR.)
.PP
The next section details more changes brought to the semantics to
the smart match operator, that naturally also modify the behaviour
of the switch statements where smart matching is implicitly used.
.SS "Smart match changes"
.IX Subsection "Smart match changes"
\fIChanges to type-based dispatch\fR
.IX Subsection "Changes to type-based dispatch"
.PP
The smart match operator \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR is no longer commutative. The behaviour of
a smart match now depends primarily on the type of its right hand
argument. Moreover, its semantics have been adjusted for greater
consistency or usefulness in several cases. While the general backwards
compatibility is maintained, several changes must be noted:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Code references with an empty prototype are no longer treated specially.
They are passed an argument like the other code references (even if they
choose to ignore it).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`%hash ~~ sub {}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`@array ~~ sub {}\*(C'\fR now test that the subroutine
returns a true value for each key of the hash (or element of the
array), instead of passing the whole hash or array as a reference to
the subroutine.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Due to the commutativity breakage, code references are no longer
treated specially when appearing on the left of the \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR operator,
but like any vulgar scalar.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef ~~ %hash\*(C'\fR is always false (since \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR can't be a key in a
hash). No implicit conversion to \f(CW""\fR is done (as was the case in perl
5.10.0).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$scalar ~~ @array\*(C'\fR now always distributes the smart match across the
elements of the array. It's true if one element in \f(CW@array\fR verifies
\&\f(CW\*(C`$scalar ~~ $element\*(C'\fR. This is a generalization of the old behaviour
that tested whether the array contained the scalar.
.PP
The full dispatch table for the smart match operator is given in
\&\*(L"Smart matching in detail\*(R" in perlsyn.
.PP
\fISmart match and overloading\fR
.IX Subsection "Smart match and overloading"
.PP
According to the rule of dispatch based on the rightmost argument type,
when an object overloading \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR appears on the right side of the
operator, the overload routine will always be called (with a 3rd argument
set to a true value, see overload.) However, when the object will
appear on the left, the overload routine will be called only when the
rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way distributivity of smart match
across arrays is not broken, as well as the other behaviours with complex
types (coderefs, hashes, regexes). Thus, writers of overloading routines
for smart match mostly need to worry only with comparing against a scalar,
and possibly with stringification overloading; the other common cases
will be automatically handled consistently.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR will now refuse to work on objects that do not overload it (in order
to avoid relying on the object's underlying structure). (However, if the
object overloads the stringification or the numification operators, and
if overload fallback is active, it will be used instead, as usual.)
.SS "Other incompatible changes"
.IX Subsection "Other incompatible changes"
.IP "\(bu" 4
The semantics of \f(CW\*(C`use feature :5.10*\*(C'\fR have changed slightly.
See \*(L"Modules and Pragmata\*(R" for more information.
.IP "\(bu" 4
It is now a run-time error to use the smart match operator \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR
with an object that has no overload defined for it. (This way
\&\f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR will not break encapsulation by matching against the
object's internal representation as a reference.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
The version control system used for the development of the perl
interpreter has been switched from Perforce to git.  This is mainly an
internal issue that only affects people actively working on the perl core;
but it may have minor external visibility, for example in some of details
of the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR. See perlrepository for more information.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The internal structure of the \f(CW\*(C`ext/\*(C'\fR directory in the perl source has
been reorganised. In general, a module \f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar\*(C'\fR whose source was
stored under \fIext/Foo/Bar/\fR is now located under \fIext/Foo\-Bar/\fR. Also,
some modules have been moved from \fIlib/\fR to \fIext/\fR. This is purely a
source tarball change, and should make no difference to the compilation or
installation of perl, unless you have a very customised build process that
explicitly relies on this structure, or which hard-codes the \f(CW\*(C`nonxs_ext\*(C'\fR
\&\fIConfigure\fR parameter. Specifically, this change does not by default
alter the location of any files in the final installation.
.IP "\(bu" 4
As part of the \f(CW\*(C`Test::Harness\*(C'\fR 2.x to 3.x upgrade, the experimental
\&\f(CW\*(C`Test::Harness::Straps\*(C'\fR module has been removed.
See \*(L"Updated Modules\*(R" for more details.
.IP "\(bu" 4
As part of the \f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::MakeMaker\*(C'\fR upgrade, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::MakeMaker::bytes\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish\*(C'\fR modules
have been removed from this distribution.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`Module::CoreList\*(C'\fR no longer contains the \f(CW%:patchlevel\fR hash.
.IP "\(bu" 4
This one is actually a change introduced in 5.10.0, but it was missed
from that release's perldelta, so it is mentioned here instead.
.Sp
A bugfix related to the handling of the \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR modifier and \f(CW\*(C`qr\*(C'\fR resulted
in a change of behaviour between 5.8.x and 5.10.0:
.Sp
.Vb 2

\&    $re = qr/^bar/; "foo\enbar" =~ /$re/m;

been updated to 5.1.0 from 5.0.0. See
<http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/#Notable_Changes> for the
notable changes.
.SS "A proper interface for pluggable Method Resolution Orders"
.IX Subsection "A proper interface for pluggable Method Resolution Orders"
As of Perl 5.10.1 there is a new interface for plugging and using method
resolution orders other than the default (linear depth first search).
The C3 method resolution order added in 5.10.0 has been re-implemented as
a plugin, without changing its Perl-space interface. See perlmroapi for
more information.
.ie n .SS "The ""overloading"" pragma"
.el .SS "The \f(CWoverloading\fP pragma"
.IX Subsection "The overloading pragma"
This pragma allows you to lexically disable or enable overloading
for some or all operations. (Yuval Kogman)
.SS "Parallel tests"
.IX Subsection "Parallel tests"
The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on
Unix-like platforms. Instead of running \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR, set \f(CW\*(C`TEST_JOBS\*(C'\fR in
your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run
\&\f(CW\*(C`make test_harness\*(C'\fR. On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done as
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness  # Run 3 tests in parallel
.Ve
.PP
An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make itself, because
TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting test
scripts itself, and there is no standard interface to \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR utilities to
interact with their job schedulers.
.PP
Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run in parallel (most
notably \f(CW\*(C`ext/IO/t/io_dir.t\*(C'\fR). If necessary run just the failing scripts
again sequentially and see if the failures go away.
.SS "DTrace support"
.IX Subsection "DTrace support"
Some support for DTrace has been added. See \*(L"DTrace support\*(R" in \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR.

.IX Subsection "Support for configure_requires in CPAN module metadata"
Both \f(CW\*(C`CPAN\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`CPANPLUS\*(C'\fR now support the \f(CW\*(C`configure_requires\*(C'\fR keyword
in the \f(CW\*(C`META.yml\*(C'\fR metadata file included in most recent \s-1CPAN\s0 distributions.
This allows distribution authors to specify configuration prerequisites that
must be installed before running \fIMakefile.PL\fR or \fIBuild.PL\fR.
.PP
See the documentation for \f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::MakeMaker\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Module::Build\*(C'\fR for more

The layout of directories in \fIext\fR has been revised. Specifically, all
extensions are now flat, and at the top level, with \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR in pathnames
replaced by \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR, so that \fIext/Data/Dumper/\fR is now \fIext/Data\-Dumper/\fR,
etc.  The names of the extensions as specified to \fIConfigure\fR, and as
reported by \f(CW%Config::Config\fR under the keys \f(CW\*(C`dynamic_ext\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`known_extensions\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`nonxs_ext\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`static_ext\*(C'\fR have not changed, and
still use \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR. Hence this change will not have any affect once perl is
installed. However, \f(CW\*(C`Attribute::Handlers\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Safe\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`mro\*(C'\fR have now
become extensions in their own right, so if you run \fIConfigure\fR with
options to specify an exact list of extensions to build, you will need to
change it to account for this.
.PP
For 5.10.2, it is planned that many dual-life modules will have been moved
from \fIlib\fR to \fIext\fR; again this will have no effect on an installed
perl, but will matter if you invoke \fIConfigure\fR with a pre-canned list of
extensions to build.

.IP "\(bu" 4
Use of the private structure \f(CW\*(C`mro_meta\*(C'\fR has changed slightly. Nothing
outside the core should be accessing this directly anyway.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A new tool, \f(CW\*(C`Porting/expand\-macro.pl\*(C'\fR has been added, that allows you
to view how a C preprocessor macro would be expanded when compiled.
This is handy when trying to decode the macro hell that is the perl
guts.
.SH "New Tests"
.IX Header "New Tests"
Many modules updated from \s-1CPAN\s0 incorporate new tests.
.PP
Several tests that have the potential to hang forever if they fail now
incorporate a \*(L"watchdog\*(R" functionality that will kill them after a timeout,
which helps ensure that \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`make test_harness\*(C'\fR run to
completion automatically. (Jerry Hedden).
.PP
Some core-specific tests have been added:

.SH "Known Problems"
.IX Header "Known Problems"
This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions
from either 5.10.0 or 5.8.x.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`List::Util::first\*(C'\fR misbehaves in the presence of a lexical \f(CW$_\fR
(typically introduced by \f(CW\*(C`my $_\*(C'\fR or implicitly by \f(CW\*(C`given\*(C'\fR). The variable
which gets set for each iteration is the package variable \f(CW$_\fR, not the
lexical \f(CW$_\fR [\s-1RT\s0 #67694].
.Sp
A similar issue may occur in other modules that provide functions which
take a block as their first argument, like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    foo { ... $_ ...} list
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`charnames\*(C'\fR pragma may generate a run-time error when a regex is
interpolated [\s-1RT\s0 #56444]:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    use charnames \*(Aq:full\*(Aq;
\&    my $r1 = qr/\eN{THAI CHARACTER SARA I}/;
\&    "foo" =~ $r1;    # okay
\&    "foo" =~ /$r1+/; # runtime error
.Ve
.Sp
A workaround is to generate the character outside of the regex:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $a = "\eN{THAI CHARACTER SARA I}";
\&    my $r1 = qr/$a/;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Some regexes may run much more slowly when run in a child thread compared
with the thread the pattern was compiled into [\s-1RT\s0 #55600].
.SH "Deprecations"
.IX Header "Deprecations"
The following items are now deprecated.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`Switch\*(C'\fR is buggy and should be avoided. From perl 5.11.0 onwards, it is
intended that any use of the core version of this module will emit a
warning, and that the module will eventually be removed from the core
(probably in perl 5.14.0). See \*(L"Switch statements\*(R" in perlsyn for its
replacement.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`suidperl\*(C'\fR will be removed in 5.12.0. This provides a mechanism to
emulate setuid permission bits on systems that don't support it properly.
.SH "Acknowledgements"
.IX Header "Acknowledgements"
Some of the work in this release was funded by a \s-1TPF\s0 grant.
.PP
Nicholas Clark officially retired from maintenance pumpking duty at the
end of 2008; however in reality he has put much effort in since then to
help get 5.10.1 into a fit state to be released, including writing a
considerable chunk of this perldelta.
.PP
Steffen Mueller and David Golden in particular helped getting \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
polished and synchronised with their in-core equivalents.
.PP
Craig Berry was tireless in getting maint to run under \s-1VMS,\s0 no matter how
many times we broke it for him.
.PP
The other core committers contributed most of the changes, and applied most
of the patches sent in by the hundreds of contributors listed in \fI\s-1AUTHORS\s0\fR.
.PP
(Sorry to all the people I haven't mentioned by name).
.PP
Finally, thanks to Larry Wall, without whom none of this would be
necessary.
.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the \fBperlbug\fR
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on \s-1CPAN.\s0

 Class Overview
 ==============
 
 This class is intended to efficiently manage the results returned from a Core Data fetch request.
 
 You configure an instance of this class using a fetch request that specifies the entity, optionally a filter predicate, and an array containing at least one sort ordering. When you execute the fetch, the instance efficiently collects information about the results without the need to bring all the result objects into memory at the same time. As you access the results, objects are automatically faulted into memory in batches to match likely access patterns, and objects from previous accessed disposed of. This behavior further serves to keep memory requirements low, so even if you traverse a collection containing tens of thousands of objects, you should never have more than tens of them in memory at the same time.
 
 This class is tailored to work in conjunction with views that present collections of objects. These views typically expect their data source to present results as a list of sections made up of rows. NSFetchedResultsController can efficiently analyze the result of the fetch request and pre-compute all the information about sections in the result set. Moreover, the controller can cache the results of this computation so that if the same data is subsequently re-displayed, the work does not have to be repeated. In addition:
 * The controller monitors changes to objects in its associated managed object context, and updates the results accordingly. It reports changes in the results set to its delegate.
 * The controller automatically purges unneeded objects if it receives an application low memory notification.
 * The controller maintains a persistent cache of the section information across application launches if the cacheName is not nil.  If caching is enabled, you must not mutate the fetch request, its predicate, or its sort descriptor without first calling +deleteCacheWithName:
 
 Typical use
 ===========
 
	Developers create an instance of NSFetchedResultsController and configure it with a fetchRequest.  It is expected that the sort descriptor used in the request groups the results into sections. This allows for section information to be pre-computed.
	After creating an instance, the performFetch: method should be called to actually perform the fetching.
	Once started, convenience methods on the instance can be used for configuring the initial state of the view.

	The instance of NSFetchedResultsController also registers to receive change notifications on the managed object context that holds the fetched objects. Any change in the context that affects the result set or section information is properly processed. A delegate can be set on the class so that it's also notified when the result objects have changed. This would typically be used to update the display of the view.
	WARNING: The controller only performs change tracking if a delegate is set and responds to any of the change tracking notification methods.  See the NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate protocol for which delegate methods are change tracking.
 
 Handling of Invalidated Objects
 ===============================
	
 When a managed object context notifies the NSFetchedResultsController of individual objects being invalidated (NSInvalidatedObjectsKey), the controller treats these as deleted objects and sends the proper delegate calls.
 It's possible for all the objects in a managed object context to be invalidated simultaneously. This can happen as a result of calling -reset on NSManagedObjectContext, or if a store is removed from the the NSPersistentStoreCoordinator. When this happens, NSFetchedResultsController currently does not invalidate all objects, nor does it send individual notifications for object deletions. Instead, developers must call performFetch: again to reset the state of the controller if all the objects in a context have been invalidated. They should also reset the state of their view.

	Move is reported when an object changes in a manner that affects its position in the results.  An update of the object is assumed in this case, no separate update message is sent to the delegate.
	Update is reported when an object's state changes, and the changes do not affect the object's position in the results.

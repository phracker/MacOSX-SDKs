/*

 NSURLSession is a replacement API for NSURLConnection.  It provides
 options that affect the policy of, and various aspects of the
 mechanism by which NSURLRequest objects are retrieved from the
 network.

 An NSURLSession may be bound to a delegate object.  The delegate is
 invoked for certain events during the lifetime of a session, such as
 server authentication or determining whether a resource to be loaded
 should be converted into a download.
 
 NSURLSession instances are threadsafe.

 The default NSURLSession uses a system provided delegate and is
 appropriate to use in place of existing code that uses
 +[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:queue:completionHandler:]

 An NSURLSession creates NSURLSessionTask objects which represent the
 action of a resource being loaded.  These are analogous to
 NSURLConnection objects but provide for more control and a unified
 delegate model.
 
 NSURLSessionTask objects are always created in a suspended state and
 must be sent the -resume message before they will execute.

 Subclasses of NSURLSessionTask are used to syntactically
 differentiate between data and file downloads.

 An NSURLSessionDataTask receives the resource as a series of calls to
 the URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveData: delegate method.  This is type of
 task most commonly associated with retrieving objects for immediate parsing
 by the consumer.

 An NSURLSessionUploadTask differs from an NSURLSessionDataTask
 in how its instance is constructed.  Upload tasks are explicitly created
 by referencing a file or data object to upload, or by utilizing the
 -URLSession:task:needNewBodyStream: delegate message to supply an upload
 body.

 An NSURLSessionDownloadTask will directly write the response data to
 a temporary file.  When completed, the delegate is sent
 URLSession:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingToURL: and given an opportunity 
 to move this file to a permanent location in its sandboxed container, or to
 otherwise read the file. If canceled, an NSURLSessionDownloadTask can
 produce a data blob that can be used to resume a download at a later
 time.

 Beginning with iOS 9 and Mac OS X 10.11, NSURLSessionStream is
 available as a task type.  This allows for direct TCP/IP connection
 to a given host and port with optional secure handshaking and
 navigation of proxies.  Data tasks may also be upgraded to a
 NSURLSessionStream task via the HTTP Upgrade: header and appropriate
 use of the pipelining option of NSURLSessionConfiguration.  See RFC
 2817 and RFC 6455 for information about the Upgrade: header, and
 comments below on turning data tasks into stream tasks.

 An NSURLSessionWebSocketTask is a task that allows clients to connect to servers supporting
 WebSocket. The task will perform the HTTP handshake to upgrade the connection
 and once the WebSocket handshake is successful, the client can read and write
 messages that will be framed using the WebSocket protocol by the framework.

 @enum NSURLSessionMultipathServiceType
 
 @discussion The NSURLSessionMultipathServiceType enum defines constants that
 can be used to specify the multipath service type to associate an NSURLSession.  The
 multipath service type determines whether multipath TCP should be attempted and the conditions
 for creating and switching between subflows.  Using these service types requires the appropriate entitlement.  Any connection attempt will fail if the process does not have the required entitlement.
 A primary interface is a generally less expensive interface in terms of both cost and power (such as WiFi or ethernet).  A secondary interface is more expensive (such as 3G or LTE).
 
 @constant NSURLSessionMultipathServiceTypeNone Specifies that multipath tcp should not be used.  Connections will use a single flow.
 This is the default value.  No entitlement is required to set this value.
 
 @constant NSURLSessionMultipathServiceTypeHandover Specifies that a secondary subflow should only be used
 when the primary subflow is not performing adequately.   Requires the com.apple.developer.networking.multipath entilement.
 
 @constant NSURLSessionMultipathServiceTypeInteractive Specifies that a secodary subflow should be used if the
 primary subflow is not performing adequately (packet loss, high round trip times, bandwidth issues).  The secondary
 subflow will be created more aggressively than with NSURLSessionMultipathServiceTypeHandover.  Requires the com.apple.developer.networking.multipath entitlement.
 
 @constant NSURLSessionMultipathServiceTypeAggregate Specifies that multiple subflows across multiple interfaces should be
 used for better bandwidth.  This mode is only available for experimentation on devices configured for development use.
 It can be enabled in the Developer section of the Settings app.

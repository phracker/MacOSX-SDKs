 The NSBundleResourceRequest class is used to interact with the on demand resource loading system.
 
 The purpose of the system is to allow an application to download certain resources on demand, when they are required. This also means that the system can purge a resource from disk when it is no longer required, which will save disk space. This class describes which resources are required, makes the request and reports progress, allows the app to specify how long during its execution that they are required.
 
 Resources are downloaded into the application container, and are made available via the standard NSBundle resource lookup API.
 
 The request object itself is lightweight. You may create as many as you need, for example to request the same set of tags in different components of your application.

 Ask the system to fetch the resources that were part of the tag set in this request.

If an application has too many fetched resources and the system is unable to reserve enough space for newly requested tags, the request may return an error.
 
 When you are finished with the resources and they may be purged off the disk, invoke -endAccessingResources. If the request object is deallocated, it will also inform the system that the resources are no longer in use.
 
 The completion block will be invoked on a non-main serial queue when the resources are available or an error has occurred. An example of a possible error that may be reported is the lack of a network connection or a problem connecting to the on-demand servers.
 
 Fetch requests are reference counted across the application. So if you have two requests outstanding with the same set of tags, each may be used independently without having to know about any global state. However, each NSBundleResourceRequest object may only be used once.

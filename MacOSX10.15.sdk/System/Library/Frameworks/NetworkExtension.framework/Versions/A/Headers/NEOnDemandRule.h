/*!
 * @file NEOnDemandRule.h
 * @discussion This file declares the family of NEOnDemandRule classes. NEOnDemandRule objects are used to create VPN configurations that are started "On Demand", or automatically when certain conditions specified by the rules are satisfied.
 *
 * This API is part of NetworkExtension.framework.
 *
 * When the network state of the system changes, the active On Demand rules are evaluated. The matching rule's action is saved by the system as the "current" action. When applications running on the system open network connections, the current On Demand action is checked to determine if the network connection should cause the associated NetworkExtension session to be started (or stopped). If the On Demand action is "evaluate connection", then further evaluation of the network connection's properties is performed before making the decision about whether or not the NetworkExtension session should be started.

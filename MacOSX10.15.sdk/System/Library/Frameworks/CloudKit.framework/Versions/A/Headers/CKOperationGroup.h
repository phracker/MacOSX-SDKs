/*! @class CKOperationGroup
 *
 *  @abstract A mechanism for your app to group several operations at the granularity of a user action.
 *
 *  @discussion For example, when building a Calendar application, these things might warrant being their own operation groups:
 *  - an initial fetch of data from the server, consisting of many queries, fetchChanges, and fetch operations
 *  - doing an incremental fetch of data in response to a push notification
 *  - saving several records due to a user saving a calendar event
 *
 *  You associate CKOperationGroups with CKOperations by setting the CKOperation.group property.  Create a new CKOperationGroup instance for each distinct user action.

    @class          AVComposition

    @abstract       An AVComposition combines media data from multiple local file-based sources in a custom temporal arrangement, in order to present or process media data from multiple sources together. All local file-based audiovisual assets are eligible to be combined, regardless of container type.

    @discussion
      At its top-level, AVComposition is a collection of tracks, each presenting media of a specific media type, e.g. audio or video, according to a timeline. Each track is represented by an instance of AVCompositionTrack.

      Each track is comprised of an array of track segments, each of which present a portion of the media data stored in a source container, specified by URL, a track identifier, and a time mapping, as represented by an instance of AVCompositionTrackSegment.

      The URL specifies the source container, and the track identifier indicates the track of the source container to be presented.

      The time mapping specifies the temporal range of the source track that's to be presented and also specifies the temporal range of its presentation in the composition track. If the durations of the source and destination ranges of the time mapping are the same, the media data for the segment will be presented at its natural rate. Otherwise, the segment will be presented at a rate equal to the ratio source.duration / target.duration.

      The track segments of a track are available via AVCompositionTrack's trackSegment property, an array of AVCompositionTrackSegment. The collection of tracks with media type information for each, and each with its array of track segments (URL, track identifier, and time mapping), form a complete low-level representation of a composition.

      This representation can be written out by clients in any convenient form, and subsequently the composition can be reconstituted by instantiating a new AVMutableComposition with AVMutableCompositionTracks of the appropriate media type, each with its trackSegment property set according to the stored array of URL, track identifier, and time mapping.

      A higher-level interface for constructing compositions is also presented by AVMutableComposition and AVMutableCompositionTrack, offering insertion, removal, and scaling operations without direct manipulation of the trackSegment arrays of composition tracks. This interface makes use of higher-level constructs such as AVAsset and AVAssetTrack, allowing the client to make use of the same references to candidate sources that it would have created in order to inspect or preview them prior to inclusion in a composition.

      Immutable Snapshots

        To make an immutable snapshot of a mutable composition for playback or inspection:

            // myMutableComposition is a mutable composition; the client wants to inspect and play it in its current state
            AVComposition *immutableSnapshotOfMyComposition = [myMutableComposition copy];

            // inspect and play at will, e.g.
            AVPlayerItem *playerItemForSnapshottedComposition = [[AVPlayerItem alloc] initWithAsset:immutableSnapshotOfMyComposition];

      Compositing Of Video Tracks

        During playback or other processing, such as export, without the use of an AVVideoComposition only the first enabled video track will be processed. Other video tracks are effectively ignored. To control the compositing of multiple enabled video tracks, you must create and configure an instance of AVVideoComposition and set it as the value of the videoComposition property of the AVFoundation object you're using to control processing, such as an AVPlayerItem or AVAssetExportSession.

      Mixing Of Audio Tracks

        During playback or other processing, without the use of an AVAudioMix all of the asset's enabled audio tracks are mixed together at equal levels. To control the mixing of enabled audio tracks, you must create and configure an instance of AVAudioMix and set it as the value of the audioMix property of the AVFoundation object you're using to control processing, such as an AVPlayerItem or AVAssetExportSession.

	@abstract	Property ID's and accompanying structs used by Apple audio units.

	@discussion

	Properties form the basis of much of the audio unit API. You use them with
	these AudioUnit.framework API functions declared in AUComponent.h:
	
		AudioUnitGetPropertyInfo
		AudioUnitGetProperty
		AudioUnitSetProperty

	This file first lists generic audio unit properties (those that are potentially applicable to 
	any audio unit), followed by properties specific to Apple audio units.

	Apple reserves property IDs from 0 -> 63999. Developers are free to use property IDs above this 
	range.

	All property values are passed by reference. When a property's value type is listed below,
	that value type is always passed by reference. For example, CFStringRef is passed as 
	&myCFString.

	Properties are described below using a general form:
		Scope:				The audio unit scope that the property applies to. For example, Global, 
							Input, Output, etc. For an explanation of audio unit scopes, see the 
							Audio Unit Programming Guide in the ADC Reference Library.
		Value Type:			The data type used to hold the value associated with the property. For 
							example, CFStringRef or UInt32
		Access:				How a host application can access the property in a hosted audio unit: 
							read only, write only, or read/write.
		Description:		A description of the property's role.

	The descriptions in this file apply to typical or recommended usage. Audio unit developers can
	vary the way each property is used. For example, a property may be described as applying to both
	input and output scopes, but a given audio unit may implement the property on the input scope
	only. As another example, a property may be described here as having read/write access, but an
	audio unit may implement the property as read only.

	The properties are divided into two primary sections:
		(1) Core/Embedded Implementation
			- these properties are available on all platforms where audio units are available
		
		(2) OS X 
			- these properties are available on only available on OS X

    @enum           Audio Unit scope types
    @abstract       The scope IDs for audio units define basic roles and contexts for an audio unit's state.
    @discussion		Each scope is a discrete context. Apple reserves scope IDs from 0 through 1024.

	@constant		kAudioUnitScope_Global	The context for audio unit characteristics that apply to the audio unit as a 
											whole
	@constant		kAudioUnitScope_Input	The context for audio data coming into an audio unit
	@constant		kAudioUnitScope_Output	The context for audio data leaving an audio unit
	@constant		kAudioUnitScope_Group	A context specific to the control scope of parameters (for instance, 
											MIDI Channels is an example of this scope)
	@constant		kAudioUnitScope_Part	A distinct rendering context. For instance a single timbre in a multi-timbral 
											instrument, a single loop in a multi looping capable looper unit, etc.
	@constant		kAudioUnitScope_Note	A scope that can be used to apply changes to an individual note. The 
											elementID used with this scope is the unique note ID returned from
											a started note (see MusicDeviceStartNote)
	@constant		kAudioUnitScope_Layer	A context which functions as a layer within a part and allows
											grouped control of LayerItem-scope parameters.
											An example is the percussive attack layer for an electric organ instrument
	@constant		kAudioUnitScope_LayerItem	A scope which represents an individual element within a particular Layer scope.
											The individual sample zones, envelope generators, and filters within a synth are
											examples of this.

/*!
    @enum           Generic Property IDs
    @abstract       Properties that can apply to any audio unit.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ClassInfo
						Scope:			Global (or Part for a part scope preset)
						Value Type:		CFDictionaryRef
						Access:			Read / Write
						
						The complete state of an audio unit if on global scope. An audio unit that supports part scope, may also support presets on the part scope
						that apply to individual parts.
						
						After a host sets this property it needs to notify the parameter listeners that the values of the parameters of an AU may have changed (so
						views, etc, can update their state). Something like the following code should be used:
						
						<code>
						#include <AudioToolbox/AudioUnitUtilities.h>
						
						AudioUnitParameter changedUnit;
						changedUnit.mAudioUnit = theChangedAU;
						changedUnit.mParameterID = kAUParameterListener_AnyParameter;
						AUParameterListenerNotify (NULL, NULL, &changedUnit);
						</code>

						
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_MakeConnection
						Scope:			Input
						Value Type:		AudioUnitConnection
						Access:			Write
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_SampleRate
						Scope:			Input / Output
						Value Type:		Float64
						Access:			Read / Write
						
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterList
						Scope:			Any
						Value Type:		AudioUnitParameterID
						Access:			Read
						
						The list of parameter IDs on the specified scope
						
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterInfo
						Scope:			Any
						Element:		AudioUnitParameterID of the parameter being queried
						Value Type:		AudioUnitParameterInfo
						Access:			Read
						
						The info struct describes the general characteristics of an individual parameterID
						
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_FastDispatch
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		void* (function pointer)
						Access:			Read
						
						The caller provides the selector for a given audio unit API, and retrieves a function pointer for that selector. For instance,
						this enables the caller to retrieve the function pointer for the AudioUnitRender call, so that call can be made directly
						through to the audio unit to avoid the overhead of the ComponentMgr's dispatch.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_CPULoad
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		Float64
						Access:			Read
						
						Can be used to retrieve the duty cycle (as a value from 0 to 1) of the render time that an audio unit is spending in its render call.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_StreamFormat
						Scope:			Input / Output
						Value Type:		AudioStreamBasicDescription
						Access:			Read / Write
						
						An AudioStreamBasicDescription is used to specify the basic format for an audio data path. For instance, 2 channels, 44.1KHz, Float32 linear pcm.
						The value can be both set and retrieve from an I/O element (bus)
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ElementCount
						Scope:			Any (though Global scope will always have an element count of 1)
						Value Type:		UInt32
						Access:			Read / Write
						
						Most audio units will only implement the read version of this call, thus they would have a fixed bus topology (number of input and output elements/buses).
						Some audio units possess the capability to add or remove elements, so in that case this property will be writable.
						
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_Latency
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		Float64
						Access:			Read
						
						The processing latency (the time it takes an audio unit to represent an input in its audio output) specified in seconds
						
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_SupportedNumChannels
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		AUChannelInfo array
						Access:			Read
						
						The size of this property will represent the number of AUChannelInfo structs that an audio unit provides. Each entry describes a particular number of 
						channels on any input, matched to a particular number of channels on any output. Thus an entry {2, 2} says the audio unit will support a channel configuration
						of 2 channels on an input and 2 channels on an output.
						
						Negative numbers (-1, -2) are used to indicate *any* number of channels. So {-1, -1} means any number of channels on input and output as long as they are the same.
						{-1, -2} means any number of channels on input or output buses
						
						A negative number less than -2 is used to indicate a total number of channels across every bus on that scope, regardless of how many channels are set on any
						particular bus.
						
						Zero on any side (typically only input) means that the audio unit doesn't have any input elements, and is expressing the capability of configuring its output channels.
						
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_MaximumFramesPerSlice
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		UInt32
						Access:			Read / Write
						
						This property is used to describe to an audio unit the maximum number of samples it will be asked to produce on any single given call to audio unit render. 
						
						If an audio unit can require more or less input data than its output request, then it should limit any given request for input to this number of frames (that is,
						it should "break up" its input pulls).
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_SetExternalBuffer
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		AudioUnitExternalBuffer
						Access:			Write
						
						This is used to provide to an audio unit a buffer that it can use with its input render callback's audio buffer list
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterValueStrings
						Scope:			Any
						Element:		AudioUnitParameterID of the parameter being queried 
						Value Type:		CFArrayRef
						Access:			Read
						
						Some audio unit parameters that are of an index type, can also provide names for each value of the parameter. This property returns an array containing CFStrings, where
						each element in the array is the name that should be used for that parameter value. The size of the array should be the same as the range between the parameters min and max values.
						The array's strings can then be used to build a menu for that parameter.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_GetUIComponentList
						Scope:			Any
						Value Type:		AudioComponentDescription array
						Access:			Read
						
						Presents an array of AudioComponentDescription that are of type 'auvw' (AudioUnitCarbonView). These are the carbon based custom views for that audio unit. 
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_AudioChannelLayout
						Scope:			Input/Output
						Value Type:		struct AudioChannelLayout
						Access:			read/write

						Description:
						Describes for a given scope/element the order of channels within a given stream. 
						The number of channels it describes must match the number of channels set for that 
						scope/element. Each input and output bus in an audio unit can have one instance of 
						this property. 
						
						Some audio units require this property. For example, the 3DMixer unit must 
						implement this property on its output bus. If a host application attempts to 
						clear the value of this property on a bus that requires a valid value, the
						audio unit will return a kAudioUnitErr_InvalidPropertyValue error.
						
						Input and output buses can be in one of three states in regard to Audio 
						channel layout:
						
						1. implemented and set
						2. implemented but not set 
						3. unimplemented 
						
						Requesting the value of this property when it is implemented but not set
						results in a kAudioUnitErr_PropertyNotInUse error.
						
						Use the kAudioUnitProperty_AudioChannelLayout property whenever channel
						layout is relevant. By comparison, the kAudioUnitProperty_StreamFormat 
						property cannot specify channel layout or purpose.
						
						See also: kAudioUnitProperty_SupportedChannelLayoutTags, 
						kAudioUnitProperty_StreamFormat.
	 
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_TailTime
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		Float64
						Access:			Read
						
						The time in seconds that will remain after the last valid input of any audio unit has been processed before the output is silent. For example, this could be the total
						decay time of a reverb or a delay. In general this will be a conservative estimate.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_BypassEffect
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		UInt32
						Access:			Read / Write
						
						A boolean value that can be used to bypass the processing in an effect unit, so that the input is passed unchanged through to the output
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_LastRenderError
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		OSStatus
						Access:			Read
						
						This property is set if there is an error in AudioUnitRender. The AU will then fire a property changed notification to any listeners on this property and 
						those listeners can then use this property ID to retrieve that error.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_SetRenderCallback
						Scope:			Input
						Value Type:		AURenderCallbackStruct
						Access:			Write
						
						This is used to provide the audio unit with input on the specified element (input bus) with audio data from the provided callback. The callback is delivered a buffer list
						which it must fill in with audio data. If no data is available, it should set the audio data to 0 (silence). In the normal case, f an error is returned, the audio is not processed 
						and the audio unit will return an error from AudioUnitRender.

	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_FactoryPresets
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		CFArray of AUPreset structures
						Access:			Read
						
						An array of preset structures that provide a name and number for each preset. A factory preset is then chosen using the PresentPreset property. 
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ContextName
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		CFString
						Access:			Read / Write
						
						The host can set this as information to the audio unit to describe something about the context within which the audio unit is instantiated. For instance, "track 3" could
						be set as the context, so that the audio unit's view could then display "My audio unit on track 3" as information to the user of the particular context for any audio unit.
						
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_RenderQuality
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		UInt32
						Access:			Read / Write
						
						A value (0 - 127) that can be used to control the quality (complexity) of the rendering operation. A typical usage is to set render quality to maximum for best quality, but
						if CPU usage is a concern a lesser quality can be set to trade off render quality.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_HostCallbacks
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		HostCallbackInfo
 						Access:			Write
						
						The audio unit should only call the host callbacks while it is in its render function. The audio unit must provide the client info when calling the callbacks as provided
						by the host. They are provided as a means for an audio unit to gain information from the host about parameters that may affect its rendering operation. 
						For example, what is the current beat of the host, is the transport running, and so forth.
						
						Any of the parameters of the callback function, when called by the audio unit, can be NULL. This indicates that the unit doesn't want to know that particular information. 
						The exception is that the unit must always specify the HostUserData which was be supplied to the unit when the property was set.

						If the host is unable to provide the requested information then it can return the kAudioUnitErr_CannotDoInCurrentContext error code

	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_InPlaceProcessing
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		UInt32
						Access:			Read / Write
						
						A property that can be used to determine if the audio unit can process input data on the same data as is provided to it, and if so this can be turned off if the host
						has a particular buffer management strategy and such an operation would defeat that.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ElementName
						Scope:				any
						Value Type:			CFStringRef
						Access:				read/write
						Description:
						The name of the specified element. The Host owns a reference to this property value 
						(as with all other CF properties), and should release the string retrieved or used when setting.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_CocoaUI
						Scope:				Global
						Value Type:			struct AudioUnitCocoaViewInfo
						Access:				read

						Publishes the audio unit's custom Cocoa NSViews. The Host can determine how big this structure is by 
						querying the size of the property (i.e., How many alternate UI classes there are for the unit)
						Typically, most audio units will provide 1 UI class per unit
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_SupportedChannelLayoutTags
						Scope:				Input/Output
						Value Type:			AudioChannelLayoutTags[ variable number of elements ]
						Access:				read only

						Used with GetProperty to ascertain what an audio unit understands about
						laying out of channel orders. This will normally return one or more of the specified layout tags.
						
						When a specific set of layouts are returned, the client then uses the 
						kAudioUnitProperty_AudioChannelLayout property (with one of those layout tags specified) to set 
						the unit to use that layout. In this case the client (and the audio unit when reporting its 
						AudioChannelLayout) is only expected to have set an AudioChannelLayout which only sets the 
						layout tag as the valid field.
						
						Custom Channel Maps:
						Some audio units may return the tag:
							kAudioChannelLayoutTag_UseChannelDescriptions
						
						In this case, the host then can look at supported number of channels on that scope
						(using the kAudioUnitProperty_SupportedNumChannels), and supply an AudioChannelLayout with the 
						kAudioUnitProperty_AudioChannelLayout property to specify the layout, number of channels
						and location of each of those channels. This custom channel map MUST have a channel valence
						that is supported by the Audio Unit.
						
						The UseChannelBitmap field is NOT used within the context of the AudioUnit.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterIDName
						Scope:				any
						Element:			AudioUnitParameterID of the parameter being queried
						Value Type:			AudioUnitParameterIDName
						Access:				read

						An audio unit returns the full parameter name in the GetParameterInfo struct/property.
						In some display situations however, there may only be room for a few characters, and
						truncating this full name may give a less than optimal name for the user. Thus, 
						this property can be used to ask the audio unit whether it can supply a truncated name, with
						the host suggesting a length (number of characters). If the unit returns a longer
						name than the host requests, that name may be truncated to the requested characters in display.
						The unit could return a shorter name than requested as well. The unit returns a CFString
						that should be released by the host. When using this property, the host asks for
						the name in the same scope and element as the unit publishes the parameter.

	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterClumpName
						Scope:				any
						Value Type:			AudioUnitParameterIDName
						Access:				read

						This works in a similar manner to the ParameterIDName property, except that the inID
						value is one of the clumpID's that are returned with the audio unit's ParameterInfo 
						structure.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_PresentPreset
						Scope:				Global/Part
						Value Type:			AUPreset
						Access:				read/write

						This property replaces the deprecated CurrentPreset property, due to the ambiguity of
						ownership of the CFString of the preset name in the older CurrentPreset property. 
						With PresentPreset the client of the audio unit owns the CFString when it retrieves the
						preset with PresentPreset and is expected to release this (as with ALL properties 
						that retrieve a CF object from an audio unit).
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_OfflineRender
						Scope:				Global
						Value Type:			UInt32
						Access:				Read / Write
						
						This is used by the host to indicate when an audio unit (that normally operates within a general real-time calling model) is 
						rendering in an offline context. A typical usage of this is to set this to true when the rendering operation an audio unit is being used within is 
						going to write out the results to a file. The value defaults to false, as the common usage of audio units is for real-time processing
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterStringFromValue
						Scope:				any
						Value Type:			AudioUnitParameterStringFromValue
						Access:				read

						This property is used with parameters that are marked with the
						kAudioUnitParameterFlag_HasName parameter info flag. This indicates that some
						(or all) of the values represented by the parameter can and should be
						represented by a special display string.
						
						This is NOT to be confused with kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterValueStrings. That property
						is used with parameters that are indexed and is typically used for instance to build
						a menu item of choices for one of several parameter values.
						
						kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterStringFromValue can have a continuous range, and merely states
						to the host that if it is displaying those parameter's values, they should request
						a name any time any value of the parameter is set when displaying that parameter.
						
						For instance (a trivial example), a unit may present a gain parameter in a dB scale,
						and wish to display its minimum value as "negative infinity". In this case, the audio unit
						will not return names for any parameter value greater than its minimum value - so the host
						will then just display the parameter value as is. For values less than or equal to the 
						minimum value, the audio unit will return a string for "negative infinity" which the host can
						use to display appropriately.
						
						A less trivial example might be a parameter that presents its values as seconds. However,
						in some situations this value should be better displayed in a SMPTE style of display:
							HH:MM:SS:FF
						In this case, the audio unit would return a name for any value of the parameter.
						
						The GetProperty call is used in the same scope and element as the inParamID 
						that is declared in the struct passed in to this property.
						
						If the *inValue member is NULL, then the audio unit should take the current value
						of the specified parameter. If the *inValue member is NOT NULL, then the audio unit should
						return the name used for the specified value.
						
						On exit, the outName may point to a CFStringRef (which if so must be released by the caller).
						If the parameter has no special name that should be applied to that parameter value,
						then outName will be NULL, and the host should display the parameter value as
						appropriate.
					
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterValueFromString
						Scope:				any
						Value Type:			AudioUnitParameterValueFromString
						Access:				read
	
						This property returns the value of a parameter from its string representation. See kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterStringFromValue.
						
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_IconLocation	
						Scope:				Global
						Value Type:			CFURLRef
						Access:				Read
						
						A URL that will specify the location of an icon file that can be used when presenting UI for this audio unit.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_PresentationLatency
						Scope:				Input/Output
						Value Type:			Float64
						Access:				write

						This property is set by a host to describe to the audio unit the presentation latency of both
						any of its input and/or output audio data. 
						It describes this latency in seconds. A value of zero means either no latency
						or an unknown latency.
						
						This is a write only property because the host is telling the audio unit the latency of both the 
						data it provides it for input and the latency from getting the data from the unit until it is 
						presented.
						
						The property is should be set on each active input and output bus (Scope/Element pair). 
						For example, an audio unit with multiple outputs will have the output data it produces processed 
						by different audio units, etc before it is mixed and presented. Thus, in this case, each output 
						element could have a different presentation latency.
						
						This should not be confused with the Latency property, where the audio unit describes to the host 
						any processing latency it introduces between its input and its output.
						
						For input:
							Describes how long ago the audio given to an audio unit was acquired. For instance, when 
							reading from a file to the first audio unit, then its input presentation latency will be zero. 
							When processing audio input from a  device, then this initial input latency will be the 
							presentation latency of the device itself, the device's safety offset and latency.
							
							The next audio unit's (connected to that first unit) input presentation latency will be the 
							input presentation latency of the first unit, plus the processing latency (as expressed by 
							kAudioUnitProperty_Latency) of the first unit.
							
						For output:
							Describes how long before the output audio of an audio unit is to be presented. For instance, 
							when writing to a file, then the last audio unit's output presentation latency will be zero. 
							When the audio from that audio unit is to be played to an AudioDevice, then that initial 
							presentation latency will be the latency of the device itself - which is the I/O buffer size, 
							and the device's safety offset and latency
							
							The previous audio unit's (connected to this last unit) output presentation latency will be that 
							initial presentation latency plus the processing latency (as expressed by 
							kAudioUnitProperty_Latency) of the last unit.
							
						So, for a given audio unit anywhere within a mixing graph, the input and output presentation 
						latencies describe to that unit how long from the moment of generation it will take for its 
						input to arrive, and how long it will take for its output to be presented. 
						
						You can use this property, for example, to provide metering for an audio unit that
						is generating output to be presented to the user at a future time.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_DependentParameters
						Scope:				any
						Value Type:			array of AUDependentParameter
						Access:				read
		
						This property is used for parameters with the kAudioUnitParameterFlag_IsGlobalMeta 
						or kAudioUnitParameterFlag_IsElementMeta flags set. Hosts applications (and the 
						AudioUnitParameterListener mechanism) can interrogate this property to determine which parameters 
						are dependent on a
						meta-parameter.
						
						For parameters marked with kAudioUnitParameterFlag_IsGlobalMeta, any non-global
						dependent parameters are assumed to be dependent in every element of their scope.
						
						For parameters marked with kAudioUnitParameterFlag_IsElementMeta, then its dependent
						parameters must all be the same scope, and are assumed to apply only within a single element,
						not to other instances of the same parameter in other elements.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_AUHostIdentifier
						Scope:				Global
						Value Type:			AUHostVersionIdentifier
						Access:				write

						Determine which application (and which version) an audio unit is being hosted by. 
						This is made more complex through the intervention of audio units such as Kore, that are hosting 
						other audio units (in this case of course, the real host of the audio unit is the hosting unit, 
						not the host application, so the previous mechanism of getting the main bundle ID is no longer 
						correct). 
						
						There are also inconsistencies in the way that bundle identifiers are applied (with apps changing 
						these from version to version), and we'd prefer to see a more consistent identifier used with 
						this property. This is in spirit similar to the string returned by CFBundle API, except that we 
						require this host string be consistent and reliable through different revisions of the host.

						The audio unit is responsible for retaining the hostName string if it needs to use it past the 
						duration of the actual call. The host should set this property as early as possible within the 
						lifetime of the unit in a session.
						
						This API used to take a NumVersion struct. It is redefined to take an AUHostVersionIdentifier struct
						which is binary compatible with the existing usage, but not source compatible.
						
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_MIDIOutputCallbackInfo
						Scope:				Global
						Value Type:			CFArrayRef
						Access:				read

						Used to determine how many MIDI output streams the audio unit can generate  (and the name for 
						each of these outputs). Each MIDI output is a complete MIDI data stream, such as embodied by a 
						MIDIEndpointRef in CoreMIDI.
						
						The host can retrieve an array of CFStringRefs published by the audio unit, where :
							- the size of the array is the number of MIDI Outputs the audio unit supports
							- each item in the array is the name for that output at that index
						
						The host should release the array when it is finished with it.
						
						Once the host has determined that the audio unit supports this feature, it can then provide a 
						callback, through which the audio unit can send the MIDI data.
						See the documentation for the kAudioUnitProperty_MIDIOutputCallback property.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_MIDIOutputCallback
						Scope:				Global
						Value Type:			AUMIDIOutputCallbackStruct
						Access:				write

						The host sets this property on the audio unit with the callback (and its user data) set 
						appropriately.
						
						Operational Parameters:
							In the render call, just as is the expected usage of the AUHostCallbacks, the audio unit can 
							call the provided callback to provide MIDI data to the host that it will associate with the 
							current AudioUnitRender call in process.

						The audio unit in the callback provides:
							- the user data provided by the host when the callback was established
							- the AudioTimeStamp that was provided to the audio unit for this particular call of 
								AudioUnitRender
							- the output number to associate this MIDI data with
							- a MIDI Packet List containing MIDI data. The time stamp values contained within the 
							MIDIPackets in this list are **sample offsets*** from the AudioTimeStamp provided. 
							This allows MIDI data to be time-stamped with a sample offset that is directly associated 
							with the audio data it is generating in the current call to the AudioUnitRender function

						There is no implied or expected association between the number (or position) of an audio unit's 
						audio or MIDI outputs.

	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_InputSamplesInOutput
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		struct AUInputSamplesInOutputCallbackStruct
						Access: 		read/write
 
						An audio unit calls this callback at the end of its render call. The audio unit supplies the 
						following information:

						outputTime      - The timestamp passed in to the audio unit's render call. This timestamp 
											represents the time of the first output sample.
						inputSample     - The sample number of the first input sample that is present in the output 
											audio.
						numInputSamples - The number of input samples that were used and are present in the output 
											audio.

						This property allows a host application to determine which input samples correspond to a sample 
						in the output buffer. It is useful only for audio units that do time-stretching, such as the 
						AUVarispeed and AUTimePitch units, where the relationship between input and output samples is 
						non-trivial. For these units, the range of input samples that correspond to an output buffer 
						typically differs from the range of input samples that were pulled for that render call. 
						This difference arises because of internal buffering, processing latency, and other factors.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ClassInfoFromDocument
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		CFDictionary
						Access: 		read/write
 
						If the audio unit implements this property then it is going to do different actions establishing
						its state from a document rather than from a user preset. Thus, a host app should use this property
						first (instead of kAudioUnitProperty_ClassInfo) when restoring the state of an audio unit when 
						opening a document. If the audio unit returns an error (or doesn't implement this property) then
						the host should use the same preset with the kAudioUnitProperty_ClassInfo. 
 

	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ShouldAllocateBuffer
						Scope:			input/output elements (settable per element)
						Value Type:		UInt32
						Access: 		read/write
 
						By default this value is true. This affects the allocations of the buffers for I/O (the mData field
						of the AudioBufferList used with AudioUnitRender, callbacks and connections)
						
						If true, the element will create a buffer for rendering into.
						
						If false, the element will not create a buffer for rendering.
						
						For example, if the audio unit is only ever going to have a connection as its input and never a callback, then
						it should not need to create a buffer (the API contract expects an audio unit to provide a buffer for
						callbacks, but no buffer for connections).
						
						If the audio unit is always going to be pulled for audio with the client providing audio data buffers to 
						the AudioUnitRender call, then it will never need to create an audio buffer on the output side.
						
						So, this property can be used to control the default allocation strategy of an audio unit. If the audio unit
						needs a buffer, but one hasn't been allocated, then an error will be thrown from that call to AudioUnitRender.
						
						This property cannot be set on Initialised audio units as it may end up reallocating memory.


	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_FrequencyResponse
						Scope:			input/output elements (settable per element)
						Value Type:		AudioUnitFrequencyResponseBin
						Access: 		read
						
						The property provides a way for a user interface view to get points for drawing a graph of the frequency
						response of the AU. 
						
						An array of AudioUnitFrequencyResponseBin are passed in to kAudioUnitProperty_FrequencyResponse
						with the mFrequency field filled in. The array is returned with the mMagnitude fields filled in.
						If fewer than kNumberOfResponseFrequencies are needed, then the first unused bin should be marked with 
						a negative frequency.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterHistoryInfo
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		AudioUnitParameterHistoryInfo
						Access: 		read
						
						For parameters which have kAudioUnitParameterFlag_PlotHistory set, getting this property fills out the 
						AudioUnitParameterHistoryInfo struct containing the recommended update rate and history duration.

	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_NickName
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		CFStringRef
						Access:			read/write
						 
						Provides a way for a host to set a custom name on an AU. 
 
						An example of when this is useful is when a host is managing a processing chain that contains multiple AU
						instances of the same subtype (and type and manufacturer). The host uses this property to assign a 
						unique name to each AU instance indicating what that particular instance's function is in the processing
						chain and can later query the property to distinguish between AU instances with the same type/subtype/manu
						tuple. It is the host's responsibility to keep the names unique if uniqueness is required. 
 
						When getting this property, ownership follows Core Foundation's 'Copy Rule'. This property may return NULL 
						which indicates that no name has been set on the AU.

	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_RequestViewController
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		block: void (^)(AUViewControllerBase *)
						Access:			write
						
						If the audio unit is implemented using the version 3 API, it may provide a
						view controller, returned via this property. As with any other CoreFoundation
						or Foundation object returned by AudioUnitGetProperty, the caller must
						release the returned reference (i.e. the Copy rule is used).

	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_ParametersForOverview
						Scope:			Global
						Value Type:		variably-sized array of struct AudioUnitParameter
						Access:			read
						
						A host may query an audio unit for a list of its N most important
						parameters, via this property. The size of the array passed to
						AudioUnitGetProperty controls the number of AudioUnitParameter values
						returned.
    @constant       kAudioUnitProperty_SupportsMPE
                        Scope:          Global
                        Value Type:     UInt32
                        Access:         read
                        
                        Indicates whether an audio unit supports Multi-dimensional Polyphonic Expression.

		These properties are used to:
			Describe a current set of mappings between MIDI messages and Parameter value setting
			Create a mapping between a parameter and a MIDI message through either:
				- explicitly adding (or removing) the mapping
				- telling the audio unit to hot-map the next MIDI message to a specified Parameter
			The same MIDI Message can map to one or more parameters
			
		These properties normally apply only to the two types of audio units that implement 
		the MIDI API, instrument units ('aumu') and music effects ('aumf').

		These properties are used in the Global scope. The scope and element members of the structure describe
		the scope and element of the parameter. In all usages, mScope, mElement and mParameterID must be
		correctly specified.

		
		* The AUParameterMIDIMapping Structure

		Command				mStatus			mData1			
		Note Off			0x8n			Note Num		
		Note On				0x9n			Note Num		
		Key Pressure		0xAn			Note Num		
		Control Change		0xBn			ControllerID	
		Patch Change		0xCn			Patch Num		
		Channel Pressure	DxDn			0 (Unused)		
		Pitch Bend			0xEn			0 (Unused)		
		
		(where n is 0-0xF to correspond to MIDI channels 1-16)
		
		Details:

		In general MIDI Commands can be mapped to either a specific channel as specified in the mStatus bit.
		If the kAUParameterMIDIMapping_AnyChannelFlag bit is set mStatus is a MIDI channel message, then the 
		MIDI channel number in the status byte is ignored; the mapping is from the specified MIDI message on ANY channel.
		
		For note commands (note on, note off, key pressure), the MIDI message can trigger either with just a specific
		note number, or any note number if the kAUParameterMIDIMapping_AnyNoteFlag bit is set. In these instances, the
		note number is used as the trigger value (for instance, a note message could be used to set the 
		cut off frequency of a filter).
		
		When the parameter mapping list changes through addition/replace, removal, the implementation should
		fire a notification on the kAudioUnitProperty_AllParameterMIDIMappings property. The host can then
		retrieve the full set of mappings for the audio unit.
		
		When a hot mapping is made, the notification should just be delivered for the HotMap property. The host can
		retrieve the last current hot mapping made through getting the value of that property.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_AllParameterMIDIMappings
	@discussion			Scope:				any
						Value Type:			array of AUParameterMIDIMapping
						Access:				read/write

						This property allows setting and retrieving the current mapping state between 
						(some/many/all of) an audio unit's parameters and MIDI messages. When set, it should replace 
						any previous mapped settings the audio unit had.
					
						If this property is implemented by a non-MIDI capable audio unit (such as an 'aufx' type), 
						then the property is read only and should recommend a suggested set of mappings for the host 
						to perform. In this case, it is the host's responsibility to map MIDI message to the audio 
						unit parameters.
						
						This property's size varies depending on the number of mappings currently in effect. A host 
						application should always get the size of this property before retrieving it. The audio
						unit should return an error if the host doesn't provide enough space to return all of the 
						current mappings.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_AddParameterMIDIMapping
	@discussion			Scope:				any
						Value Type:			array of AUParameterMIDIMapping
						Access:				write
						
						Use this property to add parameter-to-MIDI mappings to an audio unit's existing set of 
						mappings. There can be only one mapping per parameter. When you set a mapping for a parameter, 
						it replaces the previous mapping.
	
	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_RemoveParameterMIDIMapping
	@discussion			Scope:				any
						Value Type:			array of AUParameterMIDIMapping
						Access:				write

						Use this property to remove mappings from an audio unit. If a mapping is specified that
						does not currently exist in an audio unit, then the audio unit should ignore the request. 
						The Scope/Element/ParameterID is used to find the mapping to remove.

	@constant		kAudioUnitProperty_HotMapParameterMIDIMapping
	@discussion			Scope:				any
						Value Type:			AUParameterMIDIMapping
						Access:				read/write

						This property can be used in two ways, determined by the value supplied by the host 
						application.
						
						(1) If a mapping structure is provided, then that structure provides all the information 
						that the audio unit should use to map the parameter, except for the MIDI message. The audio 
						unit should then listen for the next MIDI message and associate that MIDI message with the 
						supplied parameter mapping. When this MIDI message is received and the mapping made, the 
						audio unit should also issue a notification on this property to indicate to the host that 
						the mapping has been made. The host can then retrieve the mapping that was made by getting the 
						value of this property.
						
						To avoid possible confusion, it is recommended that once the host has retrieved this mapping 
						(if it is presenting a user interface to describe the mappings, for example), that the host
						should then clear the mapping state, as described in (2).
						
						The only time this property will return a valid value is when an audio unit has implemented the 
						requested mapping. If the audio unit's mapping state has been cleared (or if it has not been 
						asked to make a mapping), then the audio unit should return a kAudioUnitErr_InvalidPropertyValue 
						error when the host tries to read this property's value.
						
						(2) If the value passed in this property is NULL, and if the audio unit had a parameter that 
						it was in the process of mapping, the audio unit should disregard the parameter mapping request 
						and discard the partially mapped structure. If the value is NULL and the audio unit is not in 
						the process of mapping, the audio unit can just ignore the request.
						
						At all times, the _AllMappings property will completely describe the current known state of an 
						audio unit's mappings of MIDI messages to parameters.

						where the element ID is the part that is being queried (or assigned).
						
						This property may be implemented in an audio unit as read only, as writeable only if the

	@constant		kMusicDeviceProperty_DualSchedulingMode

						Some instrument units need to distinguish realtime note and control events (such as from

							MusicDeviceStartNote
							MusicDeviceStopNote
							AudioUnitSetParameter

						Once the host sets this property to 1 and the instrument unit returns noErr, the

    @enum           Apple AUScheduledSoundPlayer Property IDs
    @abstract       The collection of property IDs for the Apple AUScheduledSoundPlayer audio unit.

    @discussion     The AUScheduledSoundPlayer audio unit lets a client schedule audio buffers for
                    future playback, with sample-accurate timing.
                    
                    
                    Elements and Formats
                    
                    This unit has one output element and no input elements. The output's format
                    should be a canonical audio unit stream format (native Float32, deinterleaved).


                    Scheduling

                    To schedule slices of audio for future playback, set the
                    kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduleAudioSlice property, with a ScheduledAudioSlice
                    structure as the property value. The slice's mTimeStamp.mSampleTime field
                    determines when the slice will be played. This sample number is relative to
                    the unit's start time, which you must set using the
                    kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduleStartTimeStamp property before playback will
                    begin.

                    You must retain, unmodified, the ScheduledAudioSlice structure, including
                    its mBufferList and the buffers to which it points, until the slice has been
                    completely played, or until you stop playback by uninitializing or resetting
                    the unit. The format of the slice's buffer list must match the unit's output
                    stream format.
                    
                    As of OS X 10.10 and iOS 8.0, you can use an invalid time stamp (no flags set
                    in mFlags) to indicate that the slice should be played immediately following the
                    previous slice (or immediately, if there are no slices playing).
                    
                    (The fields other than mSampleTime and mFlags in the mTimestamp structure are
                    currently ignored.)
                    
                    
                    Completion
                    
                    To receive a callback when the slice has been played, store a pointer to a
                    callback function in the mCompletionProc field. This function will be called 
                    (from the audio unit's rendering thread) when the slice has been completely 
                    played -- or when the slice is determined to be unplayable due to an error. 
                    As an alternative, you may also poll the slice's 
                    (mFlags & kScheduledAudioSliceFlag_Complete).

                    Upon completion, you can test (mFlags & kScheduledAudioSliceFlag_BeganToRenderLate) 
                    to determine whether some portion of the slice was not played due to its having 
                    been scheduled too late relative to the current playback time.
                    
                    
                    Start Time
                    
                    The audio unit will not play any slices following initialization or reset, until
                    its start time has been set. The start time establishes the beginning of a
                    timeline: the timestamps of all slices in the schedule are relative to the
                    start time.

                    Set a start time by setting the kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduleStartTimeStamp 
                    property with an AudioTimeStamp structure. If the timestamp contains a valid 
                    sample time (timestamp.mFlags & kAudioTimeStampSampleTimeValid), then playback 
                    begins when the timestamp passed to the AudioUnitRender function reaches the 
                    specified sample time. If the specified sample time is -1, playback begins on 
                    the next render cycle.
                    
                    If the start timestamp does not contain a valid sample time, but does contain a
                    valid host time (timestamp.mFlags & kAudioTimeStampHostTimeValid), then the
                    specified host time is translated to the sample time at which playback will
                    begin. A host time of 0 means "start on the next render cycle."
                    
                    The kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduleStartTimeStamp property may be queried to obtain 
                    the time at which playback began. If the start time has not yet been reached,
                    the timestamp returned will be whatever the host application last set.
                    
                    
                    Current play time
                    
                    The kAudioUnitProperty_CurrentPlayTime property may be queried to determine the 
                    audio unit's current time offset from its start time. This is useful, for 
                    example, to monitor playback progress.
                    
                    
                    Unscheduling events
                    
                    To clear an audio unit's play schedule, call the AudioUnitReset function. The 
                    completion proc (if any) for each slice in the schedule will called. Playback 
                    will not resume until a new start time has been set. This also happens when 
                    the audio unit is uninitialized.

    @enum           Apple AUAudioFilePlayer Property IDs
    @abstract       The collection of property IDs for Apple AUAudioFilePlayer
	@discussion		This audio unit lets you schedule regions of audio files for future playback,
					with sample-accurate timing.

					The unit is a subclass of AUScheduledSoundPlayer and inherits all of its
					behavior. In particular, this unit implements the kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduleStartTimeStamp 
					and kAudioUnitProperty_CurrentPlayTime properties. Instead of scheduling 
					slices (buffers) of audio to be played (via kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduleAudioSlice), 
					however, you schedule regions of audio files to be played. The unit reads and
					converts audio file data into its own internal buffers. It performs disk I/O
					on a high-priority thread shared among all instances of this unit within a
					process. Upon completion of a disk read, the unit internally schedules
					buffers for playback.


					Elements and Formats
					
					This unit has one output element and no input elements. The output's format
					should be a canonical audio unit stream format (native Float32,
					deinterleaved). This format should have at least as many channels are in the
					audio file(s) to be played (otherwise channels will be dropped). During
					playback, all audio file data is converted to the unit's output format.
					

					Audio Files

					Before starting playback, you must first open all audio files to be played
					using the AudioFile API's (see AudioToolbox/AudioFile.h), and pass their
					AudioFileIDs to the unit by setting the kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduledFileIDs
					property. This property must not be set during playback. The audio files must
					be kept open for the duration of playback.


					Scheduling Regions
					
					To schedule the playback of a region of an audio file, set the
					kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduledFileRegion property. This is a
					ScheduledAudioFileRegion structure. mTimeStamp.mSampleTime must be valid and
					is interpreted relative to the unit's start time -- the start time semantics
					(using kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduleStartTimeStamp) are identical to those of
					AUScheduledSoundPlayer. Unlike the ScheduledAudioSlice structures, the unit
					makes copies of ScheduledAudioFileRegions, so you may create them on the
					stack or otherwise reuse/dispose of them immediately after scheduling them.
					
					
					Priming
					
					You should set kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduledFilePrime after scheduling
					initial file regions to be played and before starting playback. This SetProperty call
					will begin reading the audio files and not return until the number of frames
					specified by the property value have been read.
					
					
					Completion Callbacks
					
					A region's completion callback (mCompletionProc) is called when it has been
					completely scheduled for reading from disk. This callback is issued on the disk 
					read thread. If the region is not read from disk in time to play at its
					scheduled time, mCompletionProc is called a second time with an error code,
					also from the read thread. Note that the region passed to the callback will not
					be the same memory object as was passed by the client (since the unit copies the region).
					
					
					Start Time and Current Time
					
					These properties work identically as in AUScheduledSoundPlayer.
					
					
					Unscheduling regions
					
					To clear the unit's play schedule, call the AudioUnitReset function. The completion proc
					(if any) for each file region in the schedule will be called. Playback will
					not resume until a new start time has been set. This also happens when the
					unit is uninitialized.
					
					
					Customization
					
					The size and number of the player's disk read buffers default to "sensible"
					values, but may be configured with the properties:
						kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduledFileBufferSizeFrames
						kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduledFileNumberBuffers
					

					Bugs
					
					kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduledFileBufferSizeFrames
					kAudioUnitProperty_ScheduledFileNumberBuffers
						are currently unimplemented

					An option to make the unit not perform conversion from the audio file sample
					rate to the unit's output rate may be desirable.

	@enum			AUDeferredRenderer
	@discussion		This audio unit has one input element and one output element. They must both have
					the same format, which must be canonical (Float32 deinterleaved) and must have 
					the same number of channels.

					The AUDeferredRenderer unit creates a high-priority producer thread, on which 
					calls by this AU for input are performed at a constant buffer size. This buffer size may be
					set with the kAudioUnitProperty_DeferredRendererPullSize property. The deferred 
					renderer may be asked to render at different buffer sizes by a downstream unit or
					host application, but it always pulls upstream at its constant buffer size.
					The upstream pull size MUST be greater than or equal to the downstream pull
					size.

					The upstream producer thread runs in advance of calls to its Render
					function, with respect to the timestamps being passed to Render and
					PullInput. The difference between these timestamps is the unit's "latency",
					which is always at least one upstream pull buffer. The client may specify
					additional latency with the property
					kAudioUnitProperty_DeferredRendererExtraLatency, which is a number of sample
					frames.

					It is possible, at Render time, for the producer thread to have not yet
					finished rendering the necessary data. This generates an error. In order to
					give the producer a small amount of extra time to finish rendering, the
					client may set the unit's property
					kAudioUnitProperty_DeferredRendererWaitFrames. If this property is non-zero,
					then when Render finds that insufficient data has been produced, it will
					sleep for the amount of realtime corresponding to the number of wait frames.
					It will then check again to see if the required amount of data has been
					produced, and fail if it hasn't.

	@abstract	API's for Music sequencing and playing services
	
	@discussion
		The objects in this API set include:

			- Music Sequence: a container of music tracks
			- Music Track: a time ordered list of events
			- Music Track Iterator: an object to iterate over events in a track
			- Music Player: an object used to play a sequence
		
		A MusicSequence contains an arbitrary number of tracks (MusicTrack) each of which contains
		time-stamped (in units of beats) events in time-increasing order. There are various types of
		events, defined below, including the expected MIDI events, tempo, and extended events.
		
		A MusicTrack has properties which may be inspected and assigned, including support for
		looping, muting/soloing, and time-stamp interpretation. APIs exist for iterating through the
		events in a MusicTrack, and for performing editing operations on them.
		
		A MusicPlayer is used to play a sequence and provides control of playback rate and setting
		to a particular time.
		
		Each MusicSequence may have an associated AUGraph object, which represents a set of
		AudioUnits and the connections between them.  Then, each MusicTrack of the MusicSequence may
		address its events to a specific AudioUnit within the AUGraph. In such a manner, it's
		possible to automate arbitrary parameters of AudioUnits, and schedule notes to be played to
		MusicDevices (AudioUnit software synthesizers) within an arbitrary audio processing network
		(AUGraph). A MusicSequence or its tracks can also address a CoreMIDI endpoint directly.

	@constant	kSequenceTrackProperty_LoopInfo
		read/write	- MusicTrackLoopInfo
		The default looping behaviour is off (track plays once)
		Looping is set by specifying the length of the loop. It loops from
			(TrackLength - loop length) to Track Length
			If numLoops is set to zero, it will loop forever.
		To turn looping off, you set this with loop length equal to zero.

	@constant	kSequenceTrackProperty_OffsetTime
		read/write	- MusicTimeStamp
		offset's the track's start time to the specified beat. By default this value is zero.
		
	@constant	kSequenceTrackProperty_MuteStatus
		read/write	- Boolean
		mute state of a track. By default this value is false (not muted)
		
	@constant	kSequenceTrackProperty_SoloStatus
		read/write	- Boolean
		solo state of a track. By default this value is false (not soloed)

	@constant	kSequenceTrackProperty_AutomatedParameters
		read/write	- UInt32
		Determines whether a track is used for automating parameters.
		If set to != 0 the track is used to automate parameter events to an AUNode.
		The track can only contain parameter events and these events are interpreted 
		as points in the automation curve
		
    @constant	kSequenceTrackProperty_TrackLength
		read/write	- MusicTimeStamp
		The time of the last event in the track plus any additional time that is allowed for fading out of ending notes
		or round a loop point to musical bar, etc.
		
		If this is not set, the track length will always be adjusted to the end of the last active event in a track and 
		is adjusted dynamically as events are added or removed.
		
		The property will return the max of the user set track length, or the calculated length
	 	
    @constant	kSequenceTrackProperty_TimeResolution
		read only	- SInt16 (only valid on the Tempo track)
		
		This retrieves the time resolution value for a sequence. This time resolution can be the resolution that
		was contained within the midi file used to construct a sequence. If you want to keep a time resolution
		when writing a new file, you can retrieve this value and then specify it when creating a new file from a sequence.
		
		It has no direct baring on the rendering or notion of time of the sequence itself (just its representation in file
		formats such as MIDI files). By default this is set to either:
			480 if the sequence is created manually
			some_value based on what was in a MIDI file if the sequence was created from a MIDI file

				Only MIDI based events are used when creating the MIDI file. MIDI files are normally beat based, but
				can also have a SMPTE (or real-time rather than beat time) representation.
				
				inResolution is relationship between "tick" and quarter note for saving to Standard MIDI File
					- pass in zero to use default - this will be the value that is currently set on the tempo track
					- see the comments for the set track property's time resolution
				
				The different Sequence types determine the kinds of files that can be created:

				Beats
					When saving a MIDI file, it saves a beats (PPQ) based axis

				Seconds
					When saving a MIDI file, it will save it as a SMPTE resolution - so you should specify this resolution
					when creating the MIDI file. 
					If zero is specified, 25 fps and 40 ticks/frame is used (a time scale of a millisecond)
			
				Samples
					You cannot save to a MIDI file with this sequence type

				The complete meaning of the 16-bit "division" field in a MIDI File's MThd chunk.

				If it is positive, then a tick represents 1/D quarter notes.

				If it negative:

				bits 14-8 are a signed 7-bit number representing the SMPTE format:
					-24, -25, -29 (drop), -30
				bits 7-0 represents the number of ticks per SMPTE frame
					typical values: 4, 10, 80, 100

				You can obtain millisecond resolution by specifying 25 frames/sec and 40 divisions/frame.

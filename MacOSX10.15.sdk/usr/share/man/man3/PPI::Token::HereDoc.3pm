.\" way too many mistakes in technical documents.

.SH "NAME"
PPI::Token::HereDoc \- Token class for the here\-doc

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Here-docs are incredibly handy when writing Perl, but incredibly tricky
when parsing it, primarily because they don't follow the general flow of
input.
.PP
They jump ahead and nab lines directly off the input buffer. Whitespace
and newlines may not matter in most Perl code, but they matter in here-docs.
.PP
They are also tricky to store as an object. They look sort of like an
operator and a string, but they don't act like it. And they have a second
section that should be something like a separate token, but isn't because a
strong can span from above the here-doc content to below it.
.PP
So when parsing, this is what we do.
.PP
Firstly, the PPI::Token::HereDoc object, does not represent the \f(CW\*(C`<<\*(C'\fR
operator, or the \*(L"\s-1END_FLAG\*(R",\s0 or the content, or even the terminator.
.PP
It represents all of them at once.
.PP
The token itself has only the declaration part as its \*(L"content\*(R".
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  # This is what the content of a HereDoc token is
\&  <<FOO
\&  
\&  # Or this
\&  <<"FOO"
\&  
\&  # Or even this
\&  <<      \*(AqFOO\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
That is, the \*(L"operator\*(R", any whitespace separator, and the quoted or bare
terminator. So when you call the \f(CW\*(C`content\*(C'\fR method on a HereDoc token, you
get '<< \*(L"\s-1FOO\*(R"\s0'.
.PP
As for the content and the terminator, when treated purely in \*(L"content\*(R" terms
they do not exist.
.PP
The content is made available with the \f(CW\*(C`heredoc\*(C'\fR method, and the name of
the terminator with the \f(CW\*(C`terminator\*(C'\fR method.
.PP
To make things work in the way you expect, \s-1PPI\s0 has to play some games
when doing line/column location calculation for tokens, and also during
the content parsing and generation processes.
.PP
Documents cannot simply by recreated by stitching together the token
contents, and involve a somewhat more expensive procedure, but the extra
expense should be relatively negligible unless you are doing huge
quantities of them.
.PP
Please note that due to the immature nature of \s-1PPI\s0 in general, we expect
\&\f(CW\*(C`HereDocs\*(C'\fR to be a rich (bad) source of corner-case bugs for quite a while,
but for the most part they should more or less \s-1DWYM.\s0
.SS "Comparison to other string types"
.IX Subsection "Comparison to other string types"
Although technically it can be considered a quote, for the time being
\&\f(CW\*(C`HereDocs\*(C'\fR are being treated as a completely separate \f(CW\*(C`Token\*(C'\fR subclass,
and will not be found in a search for PPI::Token::Quote or
\&\*(L"PPI::Token::QuoteLike objects\*(R".
.PP
This may change in the future, with it most likely to end up under
QuoteLike.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
Although it has the standard set of \f(CW\*(C`Token\*(C'\fR methods, \f(CW\*(C`HereDoc\*(C'\fR objects
have a relatively large number of unique methods all of their own.
.SS "heredoc"
.IX Subsection "heredoc"
The \f(CW\*(C`heredoc\*(C'\fR method is the authoritative method for accessing the contents
of the \f(CW\*(C`HereDoc\*(C'\fR object.
.PP
It returns the contents of the here-doc as a list of newline-terminated
strings. If called in scalar context, it returns the number of lines in
the here-doc, \fBexcluding\fR the terminator line.
.SS "terminator"
.IX Subsection "terminator"
The \f(CW\*(C`terminator\*(C'\fR method returns the name of the terminating string for the
here-doc.
.PP
Returns the terminating string as an unescaped string (in the rare case
the terminator has an escaped quote in it).

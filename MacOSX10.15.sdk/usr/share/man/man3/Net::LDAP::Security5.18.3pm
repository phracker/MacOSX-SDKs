.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document discusses various security issues relating to using \s-1LDAP\s0
and connecting to \s-1LDAP\s0 servers, notably how to manage these potential
vulnerabilities:
.IP "\(bu" 4
do you know that you are connected to the right server
.IP "\(bu" 4
can someone sniff your passwords/userids from the directory connection
.IP "\(bu" 4
can someone sniff other confidential information from the directory
connection
.PP
\&\fBNet::LDAP\fR provides ways to address these vulnerabilities: through the
use of \s-1LDAPS,\s0 or LDAPv3 and \s-1TLS,\s0 and/or the use of \s-1SASL.\s0 Each of these
will be explained below.
.SS "How does an \s-1LDAP\s0 connection work"
.IX Subsection "How does an LDAP connection work"
A normal LDAPv2 or LDAPv3 connection works by the client connecting
directly to port 389 (by default), and then issuing various \s-1LDAP\s0
requests like search, add, etc.
.PP
There is no way to guarantee that an \s-1LDAP\s0 client is connected to the
right \s-1LDAP\s0 server. Hackers could have poisoned your \s-1DNS,\s0 so
\&'ldap.example.com' could be made to point to 'ldap.hacker.com'. Or
they could have installed their own server on the correct machine.
.PP
It is in the nature of the \s-1LDAP\s0 protocol that all information goes
between the client and the server in 'plain text'. This is a term used
by cryptographers to describe unencrypted and recoverable data, so
even though \s-1LDAP\s0 can transfer binary values like \s-1JPEG\s0 photographs,
audio clips and X.509 certificates, everything is still considered
\&'plain text'.
.PP
If these vulnerabilities are an issue to, then you should consider the
other possibilities described below, namely \s-1LDAPS,\s0 LDAPv3 and \s-1TLS,\s0 and
\&\s-1SASL.\s0
.SS "How does an \s-1LDAPS\s0 connection work"
.IX Subsection "How does an LDAPS connection work"
\&\s-1LDAPS\s0 is an unofficial protocol. It is to \s-1LDAP\s0 what \s-1HTTPS\s0 is to \s-1HTTP,\s0
namely the exact same protocol (but in this case LDAPv2 or LDAPv3)
running over a \fIsecured\fR \s-1SSL \s0(\*(L"Secure Socket Layer\*(R") connection to
port 636 (by default).
.PP
Not all servers will be configured to listen for \s-1LDAPS\s0 connections,
but if they do, it will commonly be on a different port from the normal
plain text \s-1LDAP\s0 port.
.PP
Using \s-1LDAPS\s0 can \fIpotentially\fR solve the vulnerabilities described
above, but you should be aware that simply \*(L"using\*(R" \s-1SSL\s0 is not a magic
bullet that automatically makes your system \*(L"secure\*(R".
.PP
First of all, \s-1LDAPS\s0 can solve the problem of verifying that you are
connected to the correct server. When the client and server connect,
they perform a special \s-1SSL \s0'handshake', part of which involves the
server and client exchanging cryptographic keys, which are described
using X.509 certificates. If the client wishes to confirm that it is
connected to the correct server, all it needs to do is verify the
server's certificate which is sent in the handshake. This is done in
two ways:
.IP "1." 4
check that the certificate is signed (trusted) by someone that you
trust, and that the certificate hasn't been revoked. For instance, the
server's certificate may have been signed by Verisign
(www.verisign.com), and you decide that you want to trust Verisign to
sign legitimate certificates.
.IP "2." 4
check that the least-significant cn \s-1RDN\s0 in the server's certificate's
\&\s-1DN\s0 is the fully-qualified hostname of the hostname that you connected
to when creating the \s-1LDAPS\s0 object. For example if the server is
<cn=ldap.example.com,ou=My department,o=My company>, then the
\&\s-1RDN\s0 to check is cn=ldap.example.com.
.PP
You can do this by using the cafile and capath options when creating a
\&\fBNet::LDAPS\fR object, \fIand\fR by setting the verify option to 'require'.
.PP
To prevent hackers 'sniffing' passwords and other information on your
connection, you also have to make sure the encryption algorithm used
by the \s-1SSL\s0 connection is good enough. This is also something that gets
decided by the \s-1SSL\s0 handshake \- if the client and server cannot agree
on an acceptable algorithm the connection is not made.
.PP
\&\fBNet::LDAPS\fR will by default use all the algorithms built into your copy
of OpenSSL, except for ones considered to use \*(L"low\*(R" strength
encryption, and those using export strength encryption. You can
override this when you create the \fBNet::LDAPS\fR object using the
\&'ciphers' option.
.PP
Once you've made the secure connection, you should also check that the
encryption algorithm that is actually being used is one that you find
acceptable. Broken servers have been observed in the field which 'fail
over' and give you an unencrypted connection, so you ought to check
for that.
.SS "How does \s-1LDAP\s0 and \s-1TLS\s0 work"
.IX Subsection "How does LDAP and TLS work"
\&\s-1SSL\s0 is a good solution to many network security problems, but it is
not a standard. The \s-1IETF\s0 corrected some defects in the \s-1SSL\s0 mechanism
and published a standard called \s-1RFC 2246\s0 which describes \s-1TLS
\&\s0(\*(L"Transport Layer Security\*(R"), which is simply a cleaned up and
standardized version of \s-1SSL.\s0
.PP
You can only use \s-1TLS\s0 with an LDAPv3 server. That is because the
standard (\s-1RFC 4511\s0) for \s-1LDAP\s0 and \s-1TLS\s0 requires that the \fInormal\fR \s-1LDAP\s0
connection (ie., on port 389) can be switched on demand from plain text
into a \s-1TLS\s0 connection. The switching mechanism uses a special extended
\&\s-1LDAP\s0 operation, and since these are not legal in LDAPv2, you can only
switch to \s-1TLS\s0 on an LDAPv3 connection.
.PP
So the way you use \s-1TLS\s0 with LDAPv3 is that you create your normal
LDAPv3 connection using \f(CW\*(C`Net::LDAP::new()\*(C'\fR, and then you perform the
switch using \f(CW\*(C`Net::LDAP::start_tls()\*(C'\fR. The \f(CW\*(C`start_tls()\*(C'\fR method takes
pretty much the same arguments as \f(CW\*(C`Net::LDAPS::new()\*(C'\fR, so check above for
details.
.SS "How does \s-1SASL\s0 work"
.IX Subsection "How does SASL work"
\&\s-1SASL\s0 is an authentication framework that can be used by a number of
different Internet services, including LDAPv3. Because it is only a
framework, it doesn't provide any way to authenticate by itself; to
actually authenticate to a service you need to use a specific \s-1SASL
\&\s0\fImechanism\fR. A number of mechanisms are defined, such as \s-1CRAM\-MD5.\s0
.PP
The use of a mechanism like \s-1CRAM\-MD5\s0 provides a solution to the
password sniffing vulnerability, because these mechanisms typically do
not require the user to send across a secret (eg., a password) in the
clear across the network. Instead, authentication is carried out in a
clever way which avoids this, and so prevents passwords from being
sniffed.
.PP
\&\fBNet::LDAP\fR supports \s-1SASL\s0 using the \fBAuthen::SASL\fR class. Currently the
only \fBAuthen::SASL\fR subclasses (ie., \s-1SASL\s0 mechanism) available are
\&\s-1CRAM\-MD5\s0 and \s-1EXTERNAL.\s0
.PP
Some \s-1SASL\s0 mechanisms provide a general solution to the sniffing of all
data on the network vulnerability, as they can negotiate confidential
(ie., encrypted) network connections. Note that this is over and above
any \s-1SSL\s0 or \s-1TLS\s0 encryption! Unfortunately, perl's \fBAuthen::SASL\fR code
cannot negotiate this.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR is an extensible, generic Perl server engine.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR attempts to be a generic server as in \f(CW\*(C`Net::Daemon\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`NetServer::Generic\*(C'\fR.  It includes with it the ability to run as
an inetd process (\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server::INET\*(C'\fR), a single connection server
(\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Net::Server::Single\*(C'\fR), a forking server
(\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server::Fork\*(C'\fR), a preforking server which maintains a constant
number of preforked children (\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server::PreForkSimple\*(C'\fR), or as a
managed preforking server which maintains the number of children based
on server load (\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server::PreFork\*(C'\fR).  In all but the inetd type,
the server provides the ability to connect to one or to multiple
server ports.
.PP
The additional server types are made possible via \*(L"personalities\*(R" or
sub classes of the \f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR.  By moving the multiple types of
servers out of the main \f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR class, the \f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR
concept is easily extended to other types (in the near future, we
would like to add a \*(L"Thread\*(R" personality).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR borrows several concepts from the Apache Webserver.
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR uses \*(L"hooks\*(R" to allow custom servers such as \s-1SMTP,
HTTP, POP3,\s0 etc. to be layered over the base \f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR class.  In
addition the \f(CW\*(C`Net::Server::PreFork\*(C'\fR class borrows concepts of
min_start_servers, max_servers, and min_waiting servers.
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server::PreFork\*(C'\fR also uses the concept of an flock serialized
accept when accepting on multiple ports (PreFork can choose between
flock, IPC::Semaphore, and pipe to control serialization).
.SH "PERSONALITIES"
.IX Header "PERSONALITIES"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR is built around a common class (Net::Server) and is
extended using sub classes, or \f(CW\*(C`personalities\*(C'\fR.  Each personality
inherits, overrides, or enhances the base methods of the base class.
.PP
Included with the Net::Server package are several basic personalities,
each of which has their own use.
.IP "Fork" 4
.IX Item "Fork"
Found in the module Net/Server/Fork.pm (see Net::Server::Fork).
This server binds to one or more ports and then waits for a
connection.  When a client request is received, the parent forks a
child, which then handles the client and exits.  This is good for
moderately hit services.
.IP "\s-1INET\s0" 4
.IX Item "INET"
Found in the module Net/Server/INET.pm (see Net::Server::INET).
This server is designed to be used with inetd.  The \f(CW\*(C`pre_bind\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`bind\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`accept\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`post_accept\*(C'\fR are all overridden as these
services are taken care of by the \s-1INET\s0 daemon.
.IP "MultiType" 4
.IX Item "MultiType"
Found in the module Net/Server/MultiType.pm (see
Net::Server::MultiType).  This server has no server functionality
of its own.  It is designed for servers which need a simple way to
easily switch between different personalities.  Multiple
\&\f(CW\*(C`server_type\*(C'\fR parameters may be given and Net::Server::MultiType will
cycle through until it finds a class that it can use.
.IP "Multiplex" 4
.IX Item "Multiplex"
Found in the module Net/Server/Multiplex.pm (see
Net::Server::Multiplex).  This server binds to one or more ports.
It uses IO::Multiplex to multiplex between waiting for new connections
and waiting for input on currently established connections.  This
personality is designed to run as one process without forking.  The
\&\f(CW\*(C`process_request\*(C'\fR method is never used but the \f(CW\*(C`mux_input\*(C'\fR callback
is used instead (see also IO::Multiplex).  See
examples/samplechat.pl for an example using most of the features of
Net::Server::Multiplex.
.IP "PreForkSimple" 4
.IX Item "PreForkSimple"
Found in the module Net/Server/PreFork.pm (see
Net::Server::PreFork).  This server binds to one or more ports and
then forks \f(CW\*(C`max_servers\*(C'\fR child process.  The server will make sure
that at any given time there are always \f(CW\*(C`max_servers\*(C'\fR available to
receive a client request.  Each of these children will process up to
\&\f(CW\*(C`max_requests\*(C'\fR client connections.  This type is good for a heavily
hit site that can dedicate max_server processes no matter what the
load.  It should scale well for most applications.  Multi port accept
is accomplished using either flock, IPC::Semaphore, or pipe to
serialize the children.  Serialization may also be switched on for
single port in order to get around an \s-1OS\s0 that does not allow multiple
children to accept at the same time.  For a further discussion of
serialization see Net::Server::PreFork.
.IP "PreFork" 4
.IX Item "PreFork"
Found in the module Net/Server/PreFork.pm (see
Net::Server::PreFork).  This server binds to one or more ports and
then forks \f(CW\*(C`min_servers\*(C'\fR child process.  The server will make sure
that at any given time there are at least \f(CW\*(C`min_spare_servers\*(C'\fR but not
more than \f(CW\*(C`max_spare_servers\*(C'\fR available to receive a client request,
up to \f(CW\*(C`max_servers\*(C'\fR.  Each of these children will process up to
\&\f(CW\*(C`max_requests\*(C'\fR client connections.  This type is good for a heavily
hit site, and should scale well for most applications.  Multi port
accept is accomplished using either flock, IPC::Semaphore, or pipe to
serialize the children.  Serialization may also be switched on for
single port in order to get around an \s-1OS\s0 that does not allow multiple
children to accept at the same time.  For a further discussion of
serialization see Net::Server::PreFork.
.IP "Single" 4
.IX Item "Single"
All methods fall back to Net::Server.  This personality is provided
only as parallelism for Net::Server::MultiType.
.IP "\s-1HTTP\s0" 4
.IX Item "HTTP"
Not a distinct personality.  Provides a basic \s-1HTTP\s0 daemon.  This can
be combined with the \s-1SSL\s0 or \s-1SSLEAY\s0 proto to provide an \s-1HTTPS\s0 Daemon.
See Net::Server::HTTP.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR was partially written to make it easy to add new
personalities.  Using separate modules built upon an open architecture
allows for easy addition of new features, a separate development
process, and reduced code bloat in the core module.
.SH "SOCKET ACCESS"
.IX Header "SOCKET ACCESS"
Once started, the Net::Server will take care of binding to port and
waiting for connections.  Once a connection is received, the
Net::Server will accept on the socket and will store the result (the
client connection) in \f(CW$self\fR\->{server}\->{client}.  This
property is a Socket blessed into the the IO::Socket classes.  \s-1UDP\s0
servers are slightly different in that they will perform a \fBrecv\fR
instead of an \fBaccept\fR.
.PP
To make programming easier, during the post_accept phase, \s-1STDIN\s0 and
\&\s-1STDOUT\s0 are opened to the client connection.  This allows for programs
to be written using <\s-1STDIN\s0> and print \*(L"out\en\*(R" to print to the
client connection.  \s-1UDP\s0 will require using a \->send call.
.SH "SAMPLE CODE"
.IX Header "SAMPLE CODE"
The following is a very simple server.  The main functionality occurs
in the process_request method call as shown below.  Notice the use of
timeouts to prevent Denial of Service while reading.  (Other examples
of using \f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR can, or will, be included with this
distribution).

Playing this file from the command line will invoke a Net::Server
using the PreFork personality.  When building a server layer over the
Net::Server, it is important to use features such as timeouts to
prevent Denial Of Service attacks.
.PP
Net::Server comes with a built in echo server by default.  You can test it
out by simply running the following from the commandline:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    net\-server
.Ve
.PP
If you wanted to try another flavor you could try
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    net\-server PreFork
.Ve
.PP
If you wanted to try out a basic \s-1HTTP\s0 server you could use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    net\-server HTTP
.Ve
.PP
Or if you wanted to test out a \s-1CGI\s0 you are writing you could use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    net\-server HTTP \-\-app ../../mycgi.cgi
.Ve
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.IX Header "ARGUMENTS"
There are at least five possible ways to pass arguments to
Net::Server.  They are \fIpassing to the new method\fR, \fIpassing on
command line\fR, \fIpassing parameters to run\fR, \fIusing a conf file\fR,
\&\fIreturning values in the default_values method\fR, or \fIconfiguring the
values in post_configure_hook\fR.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`options\*(C'\fR method is used to determine which arguments the server
will search for and can be used to extend the parsed parameters.  Any
arguments found from the command line, parameters passed to run, and
arguments found in the conf_file will be matched against the keys of
the options template.  Any commandline parameters that do not match
will be left in place and can be further processed by the server in
the various hooks (by looking at \f(CW@ARGV\fR).  Arguments passed to new will
automatically win over any other options (this can be used if you
would like to disallow a user passing in other arguments).
.PP
Arguments consist of key value pairs.  On the commandline these pairs
follow the \s-1POSIX\s0 fashion of \f(CW\*(C`\-\-key value\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-key=value\*(C'\fR, and also
\&\f(CW\*(C`key=value\*(C'\fR.  In the conf file the parameter passing can best be
shown by the following regular expression:
($key,$val)=~/^(\ew+)\es+(\eS+?)\es+$/.  Passing arguments to the run
method is done as follows: \f(CW\*(C`<Net::Server\->run(key1 =\*(C'\fR 'val1')>>.
Passing arguments via a prebuilt object can best be shown in the
following code:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl \-w \-T
\&
\&    package MyPackage;
\&    use strict;
\&    use base qw(Net::Server);
\&
\&    my $server = MyPackage\->new({
\&        key1 => \*(Aqval1\*(Aq,
\&    });
\&
\&    $server\->run;
.Ve
.PP
All five methods for passing arguments may be used at the same time.
Once an argument has been set, it is not over written if another
method passes the same argument.  \f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR will look for
arguments in the following order:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    1) Arguments passed to the C<new> method.
\&    2) Arguments passed on command line.
\&    3) Arguments passed to the C<run> method.
\&    4) Arguments passed via a conf file.
\&    5) Arguments set in the C<default_values> method.
.Ve
.PP
Additionally the following hooks are available:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    1) Arguments set in the configure_hook (occurs after new
\&       but before any of the other areas are checked).
\&    2) Arguments set and validated in the post_configure_hook
\&       (occurs after all of the other areas are checked).
.Ve
.PP
Each of these levels will override parameters of the same name
specified in subsequent levels.  For example, specifying \-\-setsid=0 on
the command line will override a value of \*(L"setsid 1\*(R" in the conf file.
.PP
Note that the configure_hook method doesn't return values to set, but
is there to allow for setting up configured values before the
configure method is called.
.PP
Key/value pairs used by the server are removed by the configuration
process so that server layers on top of \f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR can pass and
read their own parameters.
.SH "ADDING CUSTOM ARGUMENTS"
.IX Header "ADDING CUSTOM ARGUMENTS"
It is possible to add in your own custom parameters to those parsed by
Net::Server.  The following code shows how this is done:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub options {
\&        my $self     = shift;
\&        my $prop     = $self\->{\*(Aqserver\*(Aq};
\&        my $template = shift;
\&
\&        # setup options in the parent classes
\&        $self\->SUPER::options($template);
\&
\&        # add a single value option
\&        $prop\->{\*(Aqmy_option\*(Aq} ||= undef;
\&        $template\->{\*(Aqmy_option\*(Aq} = \e $prop\->{\*(Aqmy_option\*(Aq};
\&
\&        # add a multi value option
\&        $prop\->{\*(Aqan_arrayref_item\*(Aq} ||= [];
\&        $template\->{\*(Aqan_arrayref_item\*(Aq} = $prop\->{\*(Aqan_arrayref_item\*(Aq};
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Overriding the \f(CW\*(C`options\*(C'\fR method allows for adding your own custom
fields.  A template hashref is passed in, that should then be modified
to contain an of your custom fields.  Fields which are intended to
receive a single scalar value should have a reference to the
destination scalar given.  Fields which are intended to receive
multiple values should reference the corresponding destination
arrayref.
.PP
You are responsible for validating your custom options once they have
been parsed.  The post_configure_hook is a good place to do your
validation.
.PP
Some emails have asked why we use this \*(L"template\*(R" method.  The idea is
that you are creating the the data structure to store the values in,
and you are also creating a way to get the values into the data
structure.  The template is the way to get the values to the servers
data structure.  One of the possibilities (that probably isn't used
that much) is that by letting you specify the mapping, you could build
a nested data structure \- even though the passed in arguments are
flat.  It also allows you to setup aliases to your names.
.PP
For example, a basic structure might look like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $prop = $self\->{\*(Aqserver\*(Aq}
\&
\&   $prop\->{\*(Aqmy_custom_option\*(Aq} ||= undef;

.IP "conf_file" 4
.IX Item "conf_file"
Filename from which to read additional key value pair arguments for
starting the server.  Default is undef.
.Sp
There are two ways that you can specify a default location for a
conf_file.  The first is to pass the default value to the run method
as in:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    MyServer\->run({
\&       conf_file => \*(Aq/etc/my_server.conf\*(Aq,
\&    });
.Ve
.Sp
If the end user passes in \-\-conf_file=/etc/their_server.conf then the
value will be overridden.
.Sp
The second way to do this was added in the 0.96 version.  It uses the
default_values method as in:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    sub default_values {
\&        return {
\&            conf_file => \*(Aq/etc/my_server.conf\*(Aq,
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
This method has the advantage of also being able to be overridden in
the run method.
.Sp
If you do not want the user to be able to specify a conf_file at all,
you can pass conf_file to the new method when creating your object:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    MyServer\->new({
\&       conf_file => \*(Aq/etc/my_server.conf\*(Aq,
\&    })\->run;
.Ve
.Sp
If passed this way, the value passed to new will \*(L"win\*(R" over any of the
other passed in values.
.IP "log_level" 4
.IX Item "log_level"
Ranges from 0 to 4 in level.  Specifies what level of error will be
logged.  \*(L"O\*(R" means logging is off.  \*(L"4\*(R" means very verbose.  These
levels should be able to correlate to syslog levels.  Default is 2.
These levels correlate to syslog levels as defined by the following
key/value pairs: 0=>'err', 1=>'warning', 2=>'notice', 3=>'info',
4=>'debug'.
.IP "log_file" 4
.IX Item "log_file"
Name of log file or log subsystem to be written to.  If no name is given and the
write_to_log_hook is not overridden, log goes to \s-1STDERR. \s0 Default is
undef.
.Sp
The log_file may also be the name of a Net::Server pluggable logging
class.  Net::Server is packaged with Sys::Syslog and Log::Log4perl.
If the log_file looks like a module name, it will have
\&\*(L"Net::Server::Log::\*(R" added to the front and it will then be required.
The package should provide an \f(CW\*(C`initialize\*(C'\fR class method that returns
a single function which will be used for logging.  This returned
function will be passed log_level, and message.
.Sp
If the magic name \*(L"Sys::Syslog\*(R" is used, all logging will take place
via the Net::Server::Log::Sys::Syslog module.  If syslog is used the
parameters \f(CW\*(C`syslog_logsock\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`syslog_ident\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`syslog_logopt\*(C'\fR,and \f(CW\*(C`syslog_facility\*(C'\fR may also be defined.  See
Net::Server::Log::Sys::Syslog.
.Sp
If the magic name \*(L"Log::Log4perl\*(R" is used, all logging will be
directed to the Log4perl system.  If used, the \f(CW\*(C`log4perl_conf\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`log4perl_poll\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`log4perl_logger\*(C'\fR may also be defined. See
Net::Server::Log::Log::Log4per.
.Sp
If a \f(CW\*(C`log_file\*(C'\fR is given or if \f(CW\*(C`setsid\*(C'\fR is set, \s-1STDIN\s0 and \s-1STDOUT\s0
will automatically be opened to /dev/null and \s-1STDERR\s0 will be opened to
\&\s-1STDOUT. \s0 This will prevent any output from ending up at the terminal.
.IP "pid_file" 4
.IX Item "pid_file"
Filename to store pid of parent process.  Generally applies only to
forking servers.  Default is none (undef).
.IP "port" 4
.IX Item "port"
See Net::Server::Proto for further examples of configuration.
.Sp
Local port/socket on which to bind.  If it is a low port, the process
must start as root.  If multiple ports are given, all will be bound at
server startup.  May be of the form \f(CW\*(C`host:port/proto\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`host:port/proto/ipv\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`host:port\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`port/proto\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`port\*(C'\fR, where
\&\fIhost\fR represents a hostname residing on the local box, where \fIport\fR
represents either the number of the port (eg. \*(L"80\*(R") or the service
designation (eg. \*(L"http\*(R"), where \fIipv\fR represents the \s-1IP\s0 protocol version
(IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv*) and where \fIproto\fR represents the protocol to be
used. See Net::Server::Proto.  The following are some valid port
strings:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    20203                            # port only
\&    localhost:20203                  # host and port
\&    localhost:http                   # localhost bound to port 80
\&    localhost:20203/tcp              # host, port, protocol
\&    localhost:20203/tcp/IPv*         # host, port, protocol and family
\&    localhost, 20203, tcp, IPv*      # same
\&    localhost | 20203 | tcp | IPv*   # same
\&    localhost:20203/IPv*             # bind any configured interfaces for IPv4 or 6 (default)
\&    localhost:20203/IPv4/IPv6        # bind localhost on IPv4 and 6 (fails if it cannot do both)
\&
\&    *:20203                          # bind all local interfaces
.Ve
.Sp
Additionally, when passed in the code (non-commandline, and non-config),
the port may be passed as a hashref or array hashrefs of information:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    port => {
\&        host  => \*(Aqlocalhost\*(Aq,
\&        port  => \*(Aq20203\*(Aq,
\&        ipv   => 6,     # IPv6 only
\&        proto => \*(Aqudp\*(Aq, # UDP protocol
\&    }
\&
\&    port => [{
\&        host  => \*(Aq*\*(Aq,
\&        port  => \*(Aq20203\*(Aq,
\&        ipv   => 4,     # IPv4 only
\&        proto => \*(Aqtcp\*(Aq, # (default)
\&    }, {
\&        host  => \*(Aqlocalhost\*(Aq,
\&        port  => \*(Aq20204\*(Aq,
\&        ipv   => \*(Aq*\*(Aq,      # default \- all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces tied to localhost
\&        proto => \*(Aqssleay\*(Aq, # or ssl \- Using SSL
\&    }],
.Ve
.Sp
An explicit \fIhost\fR given in a port specification overrides a default
binding address (a \f(CW\*(C`host\*(C'\fR setting, see below).  The \fIhost\fR part may
be enclosed in square brackets, but when it is a numerical IPv6
address it \fBshould\fR be enclosed in square brackets to avoid ambiguity
in parsing a port number, e.g.: \*(L"[::1]:80\*(R".  However you could also
use pipes, white space, or commas to separate these.  Note that host
and port number must come first.
.Sp
If the protocol is not specified, \fIproto\fR will default to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`proto\*(C'\fR specified in the arguments.  If \f(CW\*(C`proto\*(C'\fR is not specified
there it will default to \*(L"tcp\*(R".  If \fIhost\fR is not specified, \fIhost\fR
will default to \f(CW\*(C`host\*(C'\fR specified in the arguments.  If \f(CW\*(C`host\*(C'\fR is not
specified there it will default to \*(L"*\*(R".  Default port is 20203.
Configuration passed to new or run may be either a scalar containing a
single port number or an arrayref of ports.  If \f(CW\*(C`ipv\*(C'\fR is not specified
it will default to \*(L"*\*(R" (Any resolved addresses under IPv4 or IPv6).
.Sp
If you are working with unix sockets, you may also specify
\&\f(CW\*(C`socket_file|unix\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`socket_file|type|unix\*(C'\fR where type is \s-1SOCK_DGRAM\s0
or \s-1SOCK_STREAM.\s0
.Sp
On systems that support it, a port value of 0 may be used to ask
the \s-1OS\s0 to auto-assign a port.  The value of the auto-assigned port
will be stored in the NS_port property of the Net::Server::Proto::TCP
object and is also available in the sockport method.  When the server
is processing a request, the \f(CW$self\fR\->{server}\->{sockport} property
contains the port that was connected through.
.IP "host" 4
.IX Item "host"
Local host or addr upon which to bind port.  If a value of '*' is
given, the server will bind that port on all available addresses on
the box.  The \f(CW\*(C`host\*(C'\fR argument provides a default local host address
if the \f(CW\*(C`port\*(C'\fR argument omits a host specification.  See
Net::Server::Proto. See IO::Socket.  Configuration passed to new
or run may be either a scalar containing a single host or an arrayref
of hosts \- if the hosts array is shorter than the ports array, the
last host entry will be used to augment the hosts arrary to the size
of the ports array.
.Sp
If an IPv4 address is passed, an IPv4 socket will be created.  If an
IPv6 address is passed, an IPv6 socket will be created.  If a hostname
is given, Net::Server will look at the value of ipv (default IPv4) to
determine which type of socket to create.  Optionally the ipv
specification can be passed as part of the hostname.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    host => "127.0.0.1",  # an IPv4 address
\&
\&    host => "::1",        # an IPv6 address
\&
\&    host => \*(Aqlocalhost\*(Aq,  # addresses matched by localhost (default any IPv4 and/or IPv6)

.Ve
.IP "proto" 4
.IX Item "proto"
See Net::Server::Proto.
Protocol to use when binding ports.  See IO::Socket.  As of release
2.0, Net::Server supports tcp, udp, and unix, unixdgram, ssl, and
ssleay.  Other types will need to be added later (or custom modules
extending the Net::Server::Proto class may be used).  Configuration
passed to new or run may be either a scalar containing a single proto
or an arrayref of protos \- if the protos array is shorter than the
ports array, the last proto entry will be used to augment the protos
arrary to the size of the ports array.
.Sp
Additionally the proto may also contain the ipv specification.
.IP "ipv (IPv4 and IPv6)" 4
.IX Item "ipv (IPv4 and IPv6)"
See Net::Server::Proto.
.Sp
IPv6 is now available under Net::Server.  It will be used
automatically if an IPv6 address is passed, or if the ipv is set
explicitly to IPv6, or if ipv is left as the default value of IPv*.
This is a significant change from version 2.004 and earlier where the
default value was IPv4.  However, the previous behavior led to
confusion on IPv6 only hosts, and on hosts that only had IPv6 entries
for a local hostname.  Trying to pass an IPv4 address when ipv is set
to 6 (only 6 \- not * or 4) will result in an error.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    localhost:20203 # will use IPv6 if there is a corresponding entry for localhost

In many proposed Net::Server solutions, IPv* was enabled by default.
For versions 2.000 through 2.004, the previous default of IPv4 was
used.  We have attempted to make it easy to set IPv4, IPv6, or IPv*.
If you do not want or need IPv6, simply set ipv to 4, pass IPv4 along
in the port specification, set \f(CW$ENV\fR{'\s-1IPV\s0'}=4; before running the
server, or uninstall IO::Socket::INET6.
.Sp
On my local box the following command results in the following output:
.Sp
.Vb 1

\&    Binding to TCP port 20203 on host ::1 with IPv6
\&    Binding to TCP port 20203 on host 127.0.0.1 with IPv4
.Ve
.Sp
My local box has IPv6 enabled and there are entries for localhost on
both IPv6 ::1 and IPv4 127.0.0.1.  I could also choose to explicitly
bind ports rather than depending upon ipv => \*(L"*\*(R" to resolve them for
me as in the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-e \*(Aquse base qw(Net::Server); main\->run(port => [20203,20203], host => "localhost", ipv => [4,6])\*(Aq
\&
\&    Binding to TCP port 20203 on host localhost with IPv4
\&    Binding to TCP port 20203 on host localhost with IPv6
.Ve
.Sp
There is a special case of using host => \*(L"*\*(R" as well as ipv => \*(L"*\*(R".
The Net::Server::Proto::_bindv6only method is used to check the system
setting for \f(CW\*(C`sysctl \-n net.ipv6.bindv6only\*(C'\fR (or
net.inet6.ip6.v6only).  If this setting is false, then an IPv6 socket
will listen for the corresponding IPv4 address.  For example the
address [::] (IPv6 equivalent of \s-1INADDR_ANY\s0) will also listen for
0.0.0.0.  The address ::FFFF:127.0.0.1 (IPv6) would also listen to
127.0.0.1 (IPv4).  In this case, only one socket will be created
because it will handle both cases (an error is returned if an attempt
is made to listen to both addresses when bindv6only is false).
.Sp
However, if net.ipv6.bindv6only (or equivalent) is true, then a
hostname (such as *) resolving to both a IPv4 entry as well as an IPv6
will result in both an IPv4 socket as well as an IPv6 socket.
.Sp
On my linux box which defaults to net.ipv6.bindv6only=0, the following is output.

.Sp
\&\s-1BSD\s0 differs from linux and generally defaults to
net.inet6.ip6.v6only=0.  If it cannot be determined on your \s-1OS,\s0 it
will default to false and the log message will change from \*(L"it will be
handled\*(R" to \*(L"it should be handled\*(R" (if you have a non-resource
intensive way to check on your platform, feel free to email me).  Be
sure to check the logs as you test your server to make sure you have
bound the ports you desire.  You can always pass in individual
explicit IPv4 and IPv6 port specifications if you need.  For example,
if your system has both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces but you'd only like
to bind to IPv6 entries, then you should use a hostname of [::]
instead of [*].
.Sp
If bindv6only (or equivalent) is false, and you receive an IPv4
connection on a bound IPv6 port, the textual representation of the
peer's IPv4 address will typically be in a form of an IPv4\-mapped IPv6
addresses, e.g. \*(L"::FFFF:127.0.0.1\*(R" .
.Sp
The ipv parameter was chosen because it does not conflict with any
other existing usage, it is very similar to ipv4 or ipv6, it allows
for user code to not need to know about Socket::AF_INET or
Socket6::AF_INET6 or Socket::AF_UNSPEC, and it is short.

incoming peeraddr.  If cidr_allow or cidr_deny options are given, the
incoming client must match a cidr_allow and not match a cidr_deny or
the client connection will be closed.  Defaults to empty array refs.
.IP "chroot" 4
.IX Item "chroot"
Directory to chroot to after bind process has taken place and the
server is still running as root.  Defaults to undef.
.IP "user" 4
.IX Item "user"
Userid or username to become after the bind process has occured.
Defaults to \*(L"nobody.\*(R"  If you would like the server to run as root,
you will have to specify \f(CW\*(C`user\*(C'\fR equal to \*(L"root\*(R".
.IP "group" 4
.IX Item "group"
Groupid or groupname to become after the bind process has occured.
Defaults to \*(L"nobody.\*(R"  If you would like the server to run as root,
you will have to specify \f(CW\*(C`group\*(C'\fR equal to \*(L"root\*(R".
.IP "background" 4
.IX Item "background"
Specifies whether or not the server should fork after the bind method
to release itself from the command line.  Defaults to undef.  Process
will also background if \f(CW\*(C`setsid\*(C'\fR is set.
.IP "setsid" 4
.IX Item "setsid"
Specifies whether or not the server should fork after the bind method
to release itself from the command line and then run the
\&\f(CW\*(C`POSIX::setsid()\*(C'\fR command to truly daemonize.  Defaults to undef.  If
a \f(CW\*(C`log_file\*(C'\fR is given or if \f(CW\*(C`setsid\*(C'\fR is set, \s-1STDIN\s0 and \s-1STDOUT\s0 will
automatically be opened to /dev/null and \s-1STDERR\s0 will be opened to
\&\s-1STDOUT. \s0 This will prevent any output from ending up at the terminal.
.IP "no_close_by_child" 4
.IX Item "no_close_by_child"
Boolean.  Specifies whether or not a forked child process has
permission or not to shutdown the entire server process.  If set to 1,
the child may \s-1NOT\s0 signal the parent to shutdown all children.  Default
is undef (not set).
.IP "no_client_stdout" 4
.IX Item "no_client_stdout"
Boolean.  Default undef (not set).  Specifies that \s-1STDIN\s0 and \s-1STDOUT\s0
should not be opened on the client handle once a connection has been
accepted.  By default the Net::Server will open \s-1STDIN\s0 and \s-1STDOUT\s0 on
the client socket making it easier for many types of scripts to read
directly from and write directly to the socket using normal print and
read methods.  Disabling this is useful on clients that may be opening
their own connections to \s-1STDIN\s0 and \s-1STDOUT.\s0
.Sp
This option has no affect on \s-1STDIN\s0 and \s-1STDOUT\s0 which has a magic client
property that is tied to the already open \s-1STDIN\s0 and \s-1STDOUT.\s0
.IP "leave_children_open_on_hup" 4
.IX Item "leave_children_open_on_hup"
Boolean.  Default undef (not set).  If set, the parent will not
attempt to close child processes if the parent receives a \s-1SIG HUP.\s0
The parent will rebind the the open port and begin tracking a fresh
set of children.
.Sp
Children of a Fork server will exit after their current request.
Children of a Prefork type server will finish the current request and
then exit.
.Sp
Note \- the newly restarted parent will start up a fresh set of servers
on fork servers.  The new parent will attempt to keep track of the
children from the former parent but custom communication channels
(open pipes from the child to the old parent) will no longer be
available to the old child processes.  New child processes will still
connect properly to the new parent.
.IP "sig_passthrough" 4
.IX Item "sig_passthrough"
Default none.  Allow for passing requested signals through to
children.  Takes a single signal name, a comma separated list of
names, or an arrayref of signal names.  It first sends the signals to
the children before calling any currently registered signal by that
name.
.IP "tie_client_stdout" 4
.IX Item "tie_client_stdout"
Default undef.  If set will use Net::Server::TiedHandle tied interface
for \s-1STDIN\s0 and \s-1STDOUT. \s0 This interface allows \s-1SSL\s0 and \s-1SSLEAY\s0 to work.
It also allows for intercepting read and write via the
tied_stdin_callback and tied_stdout_callback.
.IP "tied_stdin_callback" 4
.IX Item "tied_stdin_callback"
Default undef.  Called during a read of \s-1STDIN\s0 data if
tie_client_stdout has been set, or if the client handle's tie_stdout
method returns true.  It is passed the client connection, the name of
the method that would be called, and the arguments that are being
passed.  The callback is then responsible for calling that method on
the handle or for performing some other input operation.
.IP "tied_stdout_callback" 4
.IX Item "tied_stdout_callback"
Default undef.  Called during a write of data to \s-1STDOUT\s0 if
tie_client_stdout has been set, or if the client handle's tie_stdout
method returns true.  It is passed the client connection, the name of
the method that would be called, and the arguments that are being
passed.  The callback is then responsible for calling that method on
the handle or for performing some other output operation.
.SH "PROPERTIES"
.IX Header "PROPERTIES"
All of the \f(CW\*(C`ARGUMENTS\*(C'\fR listed above become properties of the server
object under the same name.  These properties, as well as other
internal properties, are available during hooks and other method
calls.
.PP
The structure of a Net::Server object is shown below:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    $self = bless({
\&        server => {
\&            key1 => \*(Aqval1\*(Aq,
\&            # more key/vals
\&        },
\&    }, \*(AqNet::Server\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
This structure was chosen so that all server related properties are
grouped under a single key of the object hashref.  This is so that
other objects could layer on top of the Net::Server object class and
still have a fairly clean namespace in the hashref.
.PP
You may get and set properties in two ways.  The suggested way is to
access properties directly via
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $val = $self\->{server}\->{key1};
.Ve
.PP
Accessing the properties directly will speed the server process \-
though some would deem this as bad style.  A second way has been
provided for object oriented types who believe in methods.  The second
way consists of the following methods:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $val = $self\->get_property( \*(Aqkey1\*(Aq );
\&    my $self\->set_property( key1 => \*(Aqval1\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
Properties are allowed to be changed at any time with caution (please
do not undef the sock property or you will close the client
connection).
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"

.IX Item "$self->configure"
This method attempts to read configurations from the commandline, from
the run method call, or from a specified conf_file (the conf_file may
be specified by passed in parameters, or in the default_values).  All
of the configured parameters are then stored in the {\*(L"server\*(R"}
property of the Server object.
.ie n .IP """$self\->post_configure""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->post_configure\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->post_configure"
The post_configure hook begins the startup of the server.  During this
method running server instances are checked for, pid_files are
created, log_files are created, Sys::Syslog is initialized (as
needed), process backgrounding occurs and the server closes \s-1STDIN\s0 and
\&\s-1STDOUT \s0(as needed).
.ie n .IP """$self\->pre_bind""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->pre_bind\fR" 4

the server.
.ie n .IP """$self\->bind""" 4

During this phase, the server accepts incoming connections.  The
behavior of how the accepting occurs and if a child process handles
the connection is controlled by what type of Net::Server personality
the server is using.
.Sp
Net::Server and Net::Server single accept only one connection at a
time.
.Sp
Net::Server::INET runs one connection and then exits (for use by inetd
or xinetd daemons).
.Sp
Net::Server::MultiPlex allows for one process to simultaneously handle
multiple connections (but requires rewriting the process_request code
to operate in a more \*(L"packet-like\*(R" manner).
.Sp
Net::Server::Fork forks off a new child process for each incoming
connection.
.Sp
Net::Server::PreForkSimple starts up a fixed number of processes that
all accept on incoming connections.
.Sp
Net::Server::PreFork starts up a base number of child processes which
all accept on incoming connections.  The server throttles the number
of processes running depending upon the number of requests coming in
(similar to concept to how Apache controls its child processes in a
PreFork server).

This method takes care of cleaning up any remaining child processes,
setting appropriate flags on sockets (for HUPing), closing up logging,

.SH "HOOKS"
.IX Header "HOOKS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR provides a number of \*(L"hooks\*(R" allowing for servers
layered on top of \f(CW\*(C`Net::Server\*(C'\fR to respond at different levels of
execution without having to \*(L"\s-1SUPER\*(R"\s0 class the main built-in methods.
The placement of the hooks can be seen in the \s-1PROCESS FLOW\s0 section.
.PP
Almost all of the default hook methods do nothing.  To use a hook you
simply need to override the method in your subclass.  For example to
add your own post_configure_hook you could do something like the
following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package MyServer;
\&
\&    sub post_configure_hook {
\&        my $self = shift;
\&        my $prop = $self\->{\*(Aqserver\*(Aq};
\&
\&        # do some validation here
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The following describes the hooks available in the plain Net::Server
class (other flavors such as Fork or PreFork have additional hooks).
.ie n .IP """$self\->configure_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->configure_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->configure_hook()"
This hook takes place immediately after the \f(CW\*(C`\->run()\*(C'\fR method is
called.  This hook allows for setting up the object before any built
in configuration takes place.  This allows for custom configurability.
.ie n .IP """$self\->post_configure_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->post_configure_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->post_configure_hook()"
This hook occurs just after the reading of configuration parameters
and initiation of logging and pid_file creation.  It also occurs
before the \f(CW\*(C`\->pre_bind()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\->bind()\*(C'\fR methods are called.
This hook allows for verifying configuration parameters.
.ie n .IP """$self\->post_bind_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->post_bind_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->post_bind_hook()"
This hook occurs just after the bind process and just before any
chrooting, change of user, or change of group occurs.  At this point
the process will still be running as the user who started the server.
.ie n .IP """$self\->pre_loop_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->pre_loop_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->pre_loop_hook()"
This hook occurs after chroot, change of user, and change of group has
occured.  It allows for preparation before looping begins.
.ie n .IP """$self\->can_read_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->can_read_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->can_read_hook()"
This hook occurs after a socket becomes readible on an
accept_multi_port request (accept_multi_port is used if there are
multiple bound ports to accept on, or if the \*(L"multi_port\*(R"
configuration parameter is set to true).  This hook is intended to
allow for processing of arbitrary handles added to the IO::Select used
for the accept_multi_port.  These handles could be added during the
post_bind_hook.  No internal support is added for processing these
handles or adding them to the IO::Socket.  Care must be used in how
much occurs during the can_read_hook as a long response time will
result in the server being susceptible to \s-1DOS\s0 attacks.  A return value
of true indicates that the Server should not pass the readible handle
on to the post_accept and process_request phases.
.Sp
It is generally suggested that other avenues be pursued for sending
messages via sockets not created by the Net::Server.
.ie n .IP """$self\->post_accept_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->post_accept_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->post_accept_hook()"
This hook occurs after a client has connected to the server.  At this
point \s-1STDIN\s0 and \s-1STDOUT\s0 are mapped to the client socket.  This hook
occurs before the processing of the request.
.ie n .IP """$self\->allow_deny_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->allow_deny_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->allow_deny_hook()"
This hook allows for the checking of ip and host information beyond
the \f(CW\*(C`$self\->allow_deny()\*(C'\fR routine.  If this hook returns 1, the
client request will be processed, otherwise, the request will be
denied processing.
.Sp
As of version 2.000, the client connection is passed as an argument.
.ie n .IP """$self\->request_denied_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->request_denied_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->request_denied_hook()"
This hook occurs if either the \f(CW\*(C`$self\->allow_deny()\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`$self\->allow_deny_hook()\*(C'\fR have taken place.
.ie n .IP """$self\->post_process_request_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->post_process_request_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->post_process_request_hook()"
This hook occurs after the processing of the request, but before the
client connection has been closed.
.ie n .IP """$self\->post_client_connection_hook""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->post_client_connection_hook\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->post_client_connection_hook"
This is one final hook that occurs at the very end of the
run_client_connection method.  At this point all other methods and
hooks that will run during the run_client_connection have finished and
the client connection has already been closed.
.Sp
item \f(CW\*(C`$self\->other_child_died_hook($pid)\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Net::Server takes control of signal handling and child process
cleanup; this makes it difficult to tell when a child process
terminates if that child process was not started by Net::Server
itself.  If Net::Server notices another child process dying that it
did not start, it will fire this hook with the \s-1PID\s0 of the terminated
process.
.ie n .IP """$self\->pre_server_close_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->pre_server_close_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->pre_server_close_hook()"

.ie n .IP """$self\->write_to_log_hook""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->write_to_log_hook\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->write_to_log_hook"
This hook handles writing to log files.  The default hook is to write
to \s-1STDERR,\s0 or to the filename contained in the parameter \f(CW\*(C`log_file\*(C'\fR.
The arguments passed are a log level of 0 to 4 (4 being very verbose),
and a log line.  If log_file is equal to \*(L"Sys::Syslog\*(R", then logging
will go to Sys::Syslog and will bypass the write_to_log_hook.
.ie n .IP """$self\->fatal_hook""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->fatal_hook\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->fatal_hook"
This hook occurs when the server has encountered an unrecoverable
error.  Arguments passed are the error message, the package, file, and
line number.  The hook may close the server, but it is suggested that
it simply return and use the built in shut down features.
.ie n .IP """$self\->post_child_cleanup_hook""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->post_child_cleanup_hook\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->post_child_cleanup_hook"
This hook occurs in the parent server process after all children have
been shut down and just before the server either restarts or exits.
It is intended for additional cleanup of information.  At this point
pid_files and lockfiles still exist.
.ie n .IP """$self\->restart_open_hook""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->restart_open_hook\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->restart_open_hook"
This hook occurs if a server has been HUPed (restarted via the \s-1HUP\s0
signal.  It occurs just before reopening to the filenos of the sockets
that were already opened.
.ie n .IP """$self\->restart_close_hook""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->restart_close_hook\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->restart_close_hook"
This hook occurs if a server has been HUPed (restarted via the \s-1HUP\s0
signal.  It occurs just before restarting the server via exec.
.ie n .IP """$self\->child_init_hook()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->child_init_hook()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->child_init_hook()"
This hook is called during the forking servers.  It is also called
during run_dequeue.  It runs just after the fork and after signals
have been cleaned up.  If it is a dequeue process, the string
\&'dequeue' will be passed as an argument.
.Sp
If your child processes will be needing random numbers, this
hook is a good location to initialize srand (forked processes
maintain the same random seed unless changed).
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    sub child_init_hook {
\&        # from perldoc \-f srand
\&        srand(time ^ $$ ^ unpack "%L*", \`ps axww | gzip \-f\`);

Should return a hashref.
.Sp

.ie n .IP """$self\->handle_syslog_error""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->handle_syslog_error\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->handle_syslog_error"
Called when log_file is set to 'Sys::Syslog' and an error occurs while
writing to the syslog.  It is passed two arguments, the value of $@,
and an arrayref containing the arguments that were passed to the log
method when the error occured.
.ie n .IP """$self\->log""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->log\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->log"
Parameters are a log_level and a message.
.Sp
If log_level is set to 'Sys::Syslog', the parameters may alternately
be a log_level, a format string, and format string parameters.  (The
second parameter is assumed to be a format string if additional
arguments are passed along).  Passing arbitrary format strings to
Sys::Syslog will allow the server to be vulnerable to exploit.  The
server maintainer should make sure that any string treated as a format
string is controlled.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    # assuming log_file = \*(AqSys::Syslog\*(Aq
\&
\&    $self\->log(1, "My Message with %s in it");
\&    # sends "%s", "My Message with %s in it" to syslog
\&
\&    $self\->log(1, "My Message with %s in it", "Foo");
\&    # sends "My Message with %s in it", "Foo" to syslog
.Ve
.Sp
If log_file is set to a file (other than Sys::Syslog), the message
will be appended to the log file by calling the write_to_log_hook.
.Sp
If the log_file is Sys::Syslog and an error occurs during write, the
handle_syslog_error method will be called and passed the error
exception.  The default option of handle_syslog_error is to die \- but
could easily be told to do nothing by using the following code in your
subclassed server:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub handle_syslog_error {}
.Ve
.Sp
It the log had been closed, you could attempt to reopen it in the
error handler with the following code:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    sub handle_syslog_error {
\&        my $self = shift;
\&        $self\->open_syslog;
\&    }
.Ve
.ie n .IP """$self\->new""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->new\fR" 4

As of Net::Server 0.91 there is finally a \*(L"new\*(R" method.  This method
takes a class name and an argument hashref as parameters.  The
argument hashref becomes the \*(L"server\*(R" property of the object.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    package MyPackage;
\&    use base qw(Net::Server);
\&
\&    my $obj = MyPackage\->new({port => 20201});

.Ve
.ie n .IP """$self\->open_syslog""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->open_syslog\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->open_syslog"
Called during post_configure when the log_file option is set to
\&'Sys::Syslog'.  By default it use the parsed configuration options
listed in this document.  If more custom behavior is desired, the
method could be overridden and Sys::Syslog::openlog should be called
with the custom parameters.
.ie n .IP """$self\->shutdown_sockets""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$self\->shutdown_sockets\fR" 4
.IX Item "$self->shutdown_sockets"
This method will close any remaining open sockets.  This is called at
the end of the server_close method.
.SH "RESTARTING"
.IX Header "RESTARTING"
Each of the server personalities (except for \s-1INET\s0), support restarting
via a \s-1HUP\s0 signal (see \*(L"kill \-l\*(R").  When a \s-1HUP\s0 is received, the server
will close children (if any), make sure that sockets are left open,
and re-exec using the same commandline parameters that initially
started the server.  (Note: for this reason it is important that \f(CW@ARGV\fR
is not modified until \f(CW\*(C`\->run\*(C'\fR is called).
.PP
The Net::Server will attempt to find out the commandline used for
starting the program.  The attempt is made before any configuration
files or other arguments are processed.  The outcome of this attempt
is stored using the method \f(CW\*(C`\->commandline\*(C'\fR.  The stored
commandline may also be retrieved using the same method name.  The
stored contents will undoubtedly contain Tainted items that will cause
the server to die during a restart when using the \-T flag (Taint
mode).  As it is impossible to arbitrarily decide what is taint safe
and what is not, the individual program must clean up the tainted
items before doing a restart.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    sub configure_hook{
\&        my $self = shift;
\&
\&        ### see the contents
\&        my $ref  = $self\->commandline;

.Ve
.SH "SHUTDOWN"
.IX Header "SHUTDOWN"
Each of the Fork and PreFork personalities support graceful shutdowns
via the \s-1QUIT\s0 signal.  When a \s-1QUIT\s0 is received, the parent will signal
the children and then wait for them to exit.
.PP
All server personalities support the normal \s-1TERM\s0 and \s-1INT\s0 signal
shutdowns.
.SH "HOT DEPLOY"
.IX Header "HOT DEPLOY"
Since version 2.000, the Fork and PreFork personalities have accepted
the \s-1TTIN\s0 and \s-1TTOU\s0 signals.  When a \s-1TTIN\s0 is received, the max_servers
is increased by 1.  If a \s-1TTOU\s0 signal is received the max_servers is
decreased by 1.  This allows for adjusting the number of handling
processes without having to restart the server.
.PP
If the log_level is set to at 3, then the new value is displayed in
the logs.

Thanks to Rob Brown (bbb at cpan.org) for help with miscellaneous
concepts such as tracking down the serialized select via flock ala
Apache and the reference to IO::Select making multiport servers
possible.  And for researching into allowing sockets to remain open
upon exec (making \s-1HUP\s0 possible).
.PP
Thanks to Jonathan J. Miner <miner at doit.wisc.edu> for patching a
blatant problem in the reverse lookups.
.PP
Thanks to Bennett Todd <bet at rahul.net> for pointing out a problem
in Solaris 2.5.1 which does not allow multiple children to accept on
the same port at the same time.  Also for showing some sample code
from Viktor Duchovni which now represents the semaphore option of the
serialize argument in the PreFork server.
.PP
Thanks to \fItraveler\fR and \fImerlyn\fR from http://perlmonks.org for
pointing me in the right direction for determining the protocol used
on a socket connection.

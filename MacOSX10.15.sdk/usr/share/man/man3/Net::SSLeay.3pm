.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Net::SSLeay module contains perl bindings to openssl (<http://www.openssl.org>) library.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1COMPATIBILITY NOTE:\s0\fR Net::SSLeay cannot be built with pre\-0.9.3 openssl. It is strongly recommended
to use at least 0.9.7 (as older versions are not tested during development). Some low level \s-1API\s0 functions
may be available with certain openssl versions.
.PP
Net::SSLeay module basically comprise of:
.IP "\(bu" 4
High level functions for accessing web servers (by using \s-1HTTP/HTTPS\s0)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Low level \s-1API \s0(mostly mapped 1:1 to openssl's C functions)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Convenience functions (related to low level \s-1API\s0 but with more perl friendly interface)
.PP
There is also a related module called Net::SSLeay::Handle included in this
distribution that you might want to use instead. It has its own pod
documentation.
.SS "High level functions for accessing web servers"
.IX Subsection "High level functions for accessing web servers"
This module offers some high level convenience functions for accessing
web pages on \s-1SSL\s0 servers (for symmetry, the same \s-1API\s0 is offered for
accessing http servers, too), an \f(CW\*(C`sslcat()\*(C'\fR function for writing your own
clients, and finally access to the \s-1SSL\s0 api of the SSLeay/OpenSSL package
so you can write servers or clients for more complicated applications.
.PP
For high level functions it is most convenient to import them into your
main namespace as indicated in the synopsis.

\&\fBCase 1 (in \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0)\fR demonstrates the typical invocation of \fIget_https()\fR to fetch an \s-1HTML\s0
page from secure server. The first argument provides the hostname or \s-1IP\s0
in dotted decimal notation of the remote server to contact. The second
argument is the \s-1TCP\s0 port at the remote end (your own port is picked
arbitrarily from high numbered ports as usual for \s-1TCP\s0). The third
argument is the \s-1URL\s0 of the page without the host name part. If in
doubt consult the \s-1HTTP\s0 specifications at <http://www.w3c.org>.
.PP
\&\fBCase 2 (in \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0)\fR demonstrates full fledged use of \f(CW\*(C`get_https()\*(C'\fR. As can be seen,
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_https()\*(C'\fR parses the response and response headers and returns them as
a list, which can be captured in a hash for later reference. Also a
fourth argument to \f(CW\*(C`get_https()\*(C'\fR is used to insert some additional headers
in the request. \f(CW\*(C`make_headers()\*(C'\fR is a function that will convert a list or
hash to such headers. By default \f(CW\*(C`get_https()\*(C'\fR supplies \f(CW\*(C`Host\*(C'\fR (to make
virtual hosting easy) and \f(CW\*(C`Accept\*(C'\fR (reportedly needed by \s-1IIS\s0) headers.
.PP
\&\fBCase 2b (in \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0)\fR demonstrates how to get a password protected page. Refer to
the \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol specifications for further details (e.g. \s-1RFC\-2617\s0).
.PP
\&\fBCase 3 (in \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0)\fR invokes \f(CW\*(C`post_https()\*(C'\fR to submit a \s-1HTML/CGI\s0 form to a secure
server. The first four arguments are equal to \f(CW\*(C`get_https()\*(C'\fR (note that
the empty string (\f(CW\*(Aq\*(Aq\fR) is passed as header argument).
The fifth argument is the
contents of the form formatted according to \s-1CGI\s0 specification. 
Do not post \s-1UTF\-8\s0 data as content: use utf8::downgrade first. In this
case the helper function \f(CW\*(C`make_https()\*(C'\fR is used to do the formatting,
but you could pass any string. \f(CW\*(C`post_https()\*(C'\fR automatically adds
\&\f(CW\*(C`Content\-Type\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Length\*(C'\fR headers to the request.
.PP
\&\fBCase 4 (in \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0)\fR shows the fundamental \f(CW\*(C`sslcat()\*(C'\fR function (inspired in spirit by
the \f(CW\*(C`netcat\*(C'\fR utility :\-). It's your swiss army knife that allows you to
easily contact servers, send some data, and then get the response. You
are responsible for formatting the data and parsing the response \-
\&\f(CW\*(C`sslcat()\*(C'\fR is just a transport.
.PP
\&\fBCase 5 (in \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0)\fR is a full invocation of \f(CW\*(C`sslcat()\*(C'\fR which allows the return of errors
as well as the server (peer) certificate.
.PP
The \f(CW$trace\fR global variable can be used to control the verbosity of the
high level functions. Level 0 guarantees silence, level 1 (the default)
only emits error messages.

The above mentioned functions actually return the response headers as
a list, which only gets converted to hash upon assignment (this
assignment looses information if the same header occurs twice, as may
be the case with cookies). There are also other variants of the
functions that return unprocessed headers and that return a reference
to a hash.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  ($page, $response, @headers) = get_https(\*(Aqwww.bacus.pt\*(Aq, 443, \*(Aq/\*(Aq);

\&      print "$headers[$i] = " . $headers[$i+1] . "\en";
\&  }
\&
\&  ($page, $response, $headers, $server_cert)
\&    = get_https3(\*(Aqwww.bacus.pt\*(Aq, 443, \*(Aq/\*(Aq);

\&      for $v (@{$$headers_ref{$k}}) {
\&          print "$k = $v\en";
\&      }
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
All of the above code fragments accomplish the same thing: display all
values of all headers. The \s-1API\s0 functions ending in \*(L"3\*(R" return the
headers simply as a scalar string and it is up to the application to
split them up. The functions ending in \*(L"4\*(R" return a reference to
a hash of arrays (see perlref and perllol if you are
not familiar with complex perl data structures). To access a single value
of such a header hash you would do something like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  print $$headers_ref{COOKIE}[0];
.Ve
.PP
Variants 3 and 4 also allow you to discover the server certificate
in case you would like to store or display it, e.g.
.PP
.Vb 11
\&  ($p, $resp, $hdrs, $server_cert) = get_https3(\*(Aqwww.bacus.pt\*(Aq, 443, \*(Aq/\*(Aq);
\&  if (!defined($server_cert) || ($server_cert == 0)) {
\&      warn "Subject Name: undefined, Issuer  Name: undefined";
\&  } else {
\&      warn \*(AqSubject Name: \*(Aq
\&          . Net::SSLeay::X509_NAME_oneline(
\&                 Net::SSLeay::X509_get_subject_name($server_cert))
\&              . \*(AqIssuer  Name: \*(Aq
\&                  . Net::SSLeay::X509_NAME_oneline(
\&                         Net::SSLeay::X509_get_issuer_name($server_cert));
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Beware that this method only allows after the fact verification of
the certificate: by the time \f(CW\*(C`get_https3()\*(C'\fR has returned the https
request has already been sent to the server, whether you decide to
trust it or not. To do the verification correctly you must either
employ the OpenSSL certificate verification framework or use
the lower level \s-1API\s0 to first connect and verify the certificate
and only then send the http data. See the implementation of \f(CW\*(C`ds_https3()\*(C'\fR
for guidance on how to do this.
.PP
\fIUsing client certificates\fR
.IX Subsection "Using client certificates"
.PP
Secure web communications are encrypted using symmetric crypto keys
exchanged using encryption based on the certificate of the
server. Therefore in all \s-1SSL\s0 connections the server must have a
certificate. This serves both to authenticate the server to the
clients and to perform the key exchange.
.PP
Sometimes it is necessary to authenticate the client as well. Two
options are available: \s-1HTTP\s0 basic authentication and a client side
certificate. The basic authentication over \s-1HTTPS\s0 is actually quite
safe because \s-1HTTPS\s0 guarantees that the password will not travel in
the clear. Never-the-less, problems like easily guessable passwords
remain. The client certificate method involves authentication of the
client at the \s-1SSL\s0 level using a certificate. For this to work, both the
client and the server have certificates (which typically are
different) and private keys.
.PP
The \s-1API\s0 functions outlined above accept additional arguments that
allow one to supply the client side certificate and key files. The
format of these files is the same as used for server certificates and
the caveat about encrypting private keys applies.
.PP

.PP
\&\fBCase 2c (in \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0)\fR demonstrates getting a password protected page that also requires
a client certificate, i.e. it is possible to use both authentication
methods simultaneously.
.PP
\&\fBCase 3b (in \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0)\fR is a full blown \s-1POST\s0 to a secure server that requires both password
authentication and a client certificate, just like in case 2c.
.PP
Note: The client will not send a certificate unless the server requests one.
This is typically achieved by setting the verify mode to \f(CW\*(C`VERIFY_PEER\*(C'\fR on the
server:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  Net::SSLeay::set_verify(ssl, Net::SSLeay::VERIFY_PEER, 0);
.Ve
.PP
See \f(CW\*(C`perldoc ~openssl/doc/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_verify.pod\*(C'\fR for a full description.
.PP
\fIWorking through a web proxy\fR
.IX Subsection "Working through a web proxy"
.IP "\(bu" 4
set_proxy
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::SSLeay\*(C'\fR can use a web proxy to make its connections. You need to
first set the proxy host and port using \f(CW\*(C`set_proxy()\*(C'\fR and then just
use the normal \s-1API\s0 functions, e.g:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  Net::SSLeay::set_proxy(\*(Aqgateway.myorg.com\*(Aq, 8080);
\&  ($page) = get_https(\*(Aqwww.bacus.pt\*(Aq, 443, \*(Aq/\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
If your proxy requires authentication, you can supply a username and
password as well
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  Net::SSLeay::set_proxy(\*(Aqgateway.myorg.com\*(Aq, 8080, \*(Aqjoe\*(Aq, \*(Aqsalainen\*(Aq);
\&  ($page, $result, %headers) =
\&         = get_https(\*(Aqwww.bacus.pt\*(Aq, 443, \*(Aq/protected.html\*(Aq,
\&              make_headers(Authorization =>
\&                           \*(AqBasic \*(Aq . MIME::Base64::encode("susie:pass",\*(Aq\*(Aq))
\&              );
.Ve
.PP
This example demonstrates the case where we authenticate to the proxy as
\&\f(CW"joe"\fR and to the final web server as \f(CW"susie"\fR. Proxy authentication
requires the \f(CW\*(C`MIME::Base64\*(C'\fR module to work.

As can be seen, the \f(CW"x"\fR family of APIs takes as the first argument a flag
which indicates whether \s-1SSL\s0 is used or not.
.SS "Certificate verification and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)"
.IX Subsection "Certificate verification and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)"
OpenSSL supports the ability to verify peer certificates. It can also
optionally check the peer certificate against a Certificate Revocation
List (\s-1CRL\s0) from the certificates issuer. A \s-1CRL\s0 is a file, created by
the certificate issuer that lists all the certificates that it
previously signed, but which it now revokes. CRLs are in \s-1PEM\s0 format.
.PP
You can enable \f(CW\*(C`Net::SSLeay CRL\*(C'\fR checking like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&            &Net::SSLeay::X509_STORE_set_flags
\&                (&Net::SSLeay::CTX_get_cert_store($ssl),
\&                 &Net::SSLeay::X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK);
.Ve
.PP
After setting this flag, if OpenSSL checks a peer's certificate, then
it will attempt to find a \s-1CRL\s0 for the issuer. It does this by looking
for a specially named file in the search directory specified by
CTX_load_verify_locations.  \s-1CRL\s0 files are named with the hash of the
issuer's subject name, followed by \f(CW\*(C`.r0\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`.r1\*(C'\fR etc.  For example
\&\f(CW\*(C`ab1331b2.r0\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ab1331b2.r1\*(C'\fR. It will read all the .r files for the
issuer, and then check for a revocation of the peer certificate in all
of them.  (You can also force it to look in a specific named \s-1CRL\s0
file., see below).  You can find out the hash of the issuer subject
name in a \s-1CRL\s0 with
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        openssl crl \-in crl.pem \-hash \-noout
.Ve
.PP
If the peer certificate does not pass the revocation list, or if no
\&\s-1CRL\s0 is found, then the handshaking fails with an error.
.PP
You can also force OpenSSL to look for CRLs in one or more arbitrarily
named files.
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    my $bio = Net::SSLeay::BIO_new_file($crlfilename, \*(Aqr\*(Aq);
\&    my $crl = Net::SSLeay::PEM_read_bio_X509_CRL($bio);
\&    if ($crl) {
\&        Net::SSLeay::X509_STORE_add_crl(
\&             Net::SSLeay::CTX_get_cert_store($ssl, $crl)
\&        );
\&    } else {
\&        error reading CRL....
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Usually the URLs where you can download the CRLs is contained in the certificate
itself and you can extract them with
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @url = Net::SSLeay::P_X509_get_crl_distribution_points($cert)
.Ve
.PP
But there is no automatic downloading of the CRLs and often these CRLs are too
huge to just download them to verify a single certificate.
Also, these CRLs are often in \s-1DER\s0 format which you need to convert to \s-1PEM\s0 before
you can use it:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    openssl crl \-in crl.der \-inform der \-out crl.pem
.Ve
.PP
So as an alternative for faster and timely revocation checks you better use
the Online Status Revocation Protocol (\s-1OCSP\s0).
.SS "Certificate verification and Online Status Revocation Protocol (\s-1OCSP\s0)"
.IX Subsection "Certificate verification and Online Status Revocation Protocol (OCSP)"
While checking for revoked certificates is possible and fast with Certificate
Revocation Lists, you need to download the complete and often huge list before
you can verify a single certificate.
.PP
A faster way is to ask the \s-1CA\s0 to check the revocation of just a single or a few
certificates using \s-1OCSP.\s0 Basically you generate for each certificate an
\&\s-1OCSP_CERTID\s0 based on the certificate itself and its issuer, put the ids
togetether into an \s-1OCSP_REQUEST\s0 and send the request to the \s-1URL\s0 given in the
certificate.
.PP
As a result you get back an \s-1OCSP_RESPONSE\s0 and need to check the status of the
response, check that it is valid (e.g. signed by the \s-1CA\s0) and finally extract the
information about each \s-1OCSP_CERTID\s0 to find out if the certificate is still valid
or got revoked.
.PP
With Net::SSLeay this can be done like this:
.PP
.Vb 8

\&\f(CW\*(C`die_now()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`die_if_ssl_error()\*(C'\fR are used to conveniently print the SSLeay error
stack when something goes wrong:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        Net::SSLeay::connect($ssl) or die_now("Failed SSL connect ($!)");
\&
\&
\&        Net::SSLeay::write($ssl, "foo") or die_if_ssl_error("SSL write ($!)");
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
print_errs
.Sp
You can also use \f(CW\*(C`Net::SSLeay::print_errs()\*(C'\fR to dump the error stack without
exiting the program. As can be seen, your code becomes much more readable
if you import the error reporting functions into your main name space.
.SS "Sockets"
.IX Subsection "Sockets"
Perl uses file handles for all I/O. While SSLeay has a quite flexible \s-1BIO\s0
mechanism and perl has an evolved PerlIO mechanism, this module still
sticks to using file descriptors. Thus to attach SSLeay to a socket you
should use \f(CW\*(C`fileno()\*(C'\fR to extract the underlying file descriptor:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Net::SSLeay::set_fd($ssl, fileno(S));   # Must use fileno
.Ve
.PP
You should also set \f(CW$|\fR to 1 to eliminate \s-1STDIO\s0 buffering so you do not
get confused if you use perl I/O functions to manipulate your socket
handle.
.PP
If you need to \f(CWselect(2)\fR on the socket, go right ahead, but be warned
that OpenSSL does some internal buffering so SSL_read does not always
return data even if the socket selected for reading (just keep on
selecting and trying to read). \f(CW\*(C`Net::SSLeay\*(C'\fR is no different from the
C language OpenSSL in this respect.
.SS "Callbacks"
.IX Subsection "Callbacks"
You can establish a per-context verify callback function something like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        sub verify {
\&            my ($ok, $x509_store_ctx) = @_;
\&            print "Verifying certificate...\en";
\&                ...
\&            return $ok;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
It is used like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        Net::SSLeay::set_verify ($ssl, Net::SSLeay::VERIFY_PEER, \e&verify);
.Ve
.PP
Per-context callbacks for decrypting private keys are implemented.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_default_passwd_cb($ctx, sub { "top\-secret" });
\&        Net::SSLeay::CTX_use_PrivateKey_file($ctx, "key.pem",
\&                                             Net::SSLeay::FILETYPE_PEM)
\&            or die "Error reading private key";
\&        Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_default_passwd_cb($ctx, undef);
.Ve
.PP
If Hello Extensions are supported by your OpenSSL,
a session secret callback can be set up to be called when a session secret is set
by openssl.
.PP
Establish it like this:
    Net::SSLeay::set_session_secret_cb($ssl, \e&session_secret_cb, \f(CW$somedata\fR);
.PP
It will be called like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub session_secret_cb
\&    {
\&        my ($secret, \e@cipherlist, \e$preferredcipher, $somedata) = @_;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
No other callbacks are implemented. You do not need to use any
callback for simple (i.e. normal) cases where the SSLeay built-in
verify mechanism satisfies your needs.
.PP
It is required to reset these callbacks to undef immediately after use to prevent
memory leaks, thread safety problems and crashes on exit that
can occur if different threads set different callbacks.
.PP
If you want to use callback stuff, see examples/callback.pl! It's the
only one I am able to make work reliably.
.SS "Low level \s-1API\s0"
.IX Subsection "Low level API"
In addition to the high level functions outlined above, this module
contains straight-forward access to \s-1CRYPTO\s0 and \s-1SSL\s0 parts of OpenSSL C \s-1API.\s0
.PP
See the \f(CW\*(C`*.h\*(C'\fR headers from OpenSSL C distribution for a list of low level
SSLeay functions to call (check SSLeay.xs to see if some function has been
implemented). The module strips the initial \f(CW"SSL_"\fR off of the SSLeay names.
Generally you should use \f(CW\*(C`Net::SSLeay::\*(C'\fR in its place.
.PP
Note that some functions are prefixed with \f(CW"P_"\fR \- these are very close to
the original \s-1API\s0 however contain some kind of a wrapper making its interface
more perl friendly.
.PP
For example:
.PP
In C:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #include <ssl.h>
\&
\&        err = SSL_set_verify (ssl, SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE,
\&                                   &your_call_back_here);
.Ve
.PP
In Perl:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use Net::SSLeay;
\&
\&        $err = Net::SSLeay::set_verify ($ssl,
\&                                        Net::SSLeay::VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE,
\&                                        \e&your_call_back_here);
.Ve
.PP
If the function does not start with \f(CW\*(C`SSL_\*(C'\fR you should use the full
function name, e.g.:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $err = Net::SSLeay::ERR_get_error;
.Ve
.PP
The following new functions behave in perlish way:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        $got = Net::SSLeay::read($ssl);
\&                                    # Performs SSL_read, but returns $got
\&                                    # resized according to data received.
\&                                    # Returns undef on failure.
\&
\&        Net::SSLeay::write($ssl, $foo) || die;
\&                                    # Performs SSL_write, but automatically
\&                                    # figures out the size of $foo

\fILow level \s-1API: ALPN \s0(application layer protocol negotiation) related functions\fR
.IX Subsection "Low level API: ALPN (application layer protocol negotiation) related functions"
.PP
Application protocol can be negotiated via two different mechanisms employing
two different \s-1TLS\s0 extensions: \s-1NPN \s0(obsolete) and \s-1ALPN \s0(recommended).
.PP
The \s-1API\s0 is rather similar, with slight differences reflecting protocol
specifics. In particular, with \s-1ALPN\s0 the protocol negotiation takes place on
server, while with \s-1NPN\s0 the client implements the protocol negotiation logic.

With \s-1ALPN,\s0 the most basic implementation looks like this:

.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.IX Header "LIMITATIONS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::SSLeay::read()\*(C'\fR uses an internal buffer of 32KB, thus no single read
will return more. In practice one read returns much less, usually
as much as fits in one network packet. To work around this,
you should use a loop like this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    $reply = \*(Aq\*(Aq;
\&    while ($got = Net::SSLeay::read($ssl)) {
\&        last if print_errs(\*(AqSSL_read\*(Aq);
\&        $reply .= $got;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Although there is no built-in limit in \f(CW\*(C`Net::SSLeay::write()\*(C'\fR, the network
packet size limitation applies here as well, thus use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $written = 0;
\&
\&    while ($written < length($message)) {
\&        $written += Net::SSLeay::write($ssl, substr($message, $written));
\&        last if print_errs(\*(AqSSL_write\*(Aq);
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Or alternatively you can just use the following convenience functions:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    Net::SSLeay::ssl_write_all($ssl, $message) or die "ssl write failure";
\&    $got = Net::SSLeay::ssl_read_all($ssl) or die "ssl read failure";

Callback set using \f(CW\*(C`SSL_set_verify()\*(C'\fR does not appear to work. This may
well be an openssl problem (e.g. see \f(CW\*(C`ssl/ssl_lib.c\*(C'\fR line 1029). Try using
\&\f(CW\*(C`SSL_CTX_set_verify()\*(C'\fR instead and do not be surprised if even this stops
working in future versions.
.PP
Callback and certificate verification stuff is generally too little tested.
.PP
Random numbers are not initialized randomly enough, especially if you
do not have \f(CW\*(C`/dev/random\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`/dev/urandom\*(C'\fR (such as in Solaris
platforms \- but it's been suggested that cryptorand daemon from the SUNski
package solves this). In this case you should investigate third party
software that can emulate these devices, e.g. by way of a named pipe
to some program.
.PP
Another gotcha with random number initialization is randomness
depletion. This phenomenon, which has been extensively discussed in
OpenSSL, Apache-SSL, and Apache\-mod_ssl forums, can cause your
script to block if you use \f(CW\*(C`/dev/random\*(C'\fR or to operate insecurely
if you use \f(CW\*(C`/dev/urandom\*(C'\fR. What happens is that when too much
randomness is drawn from the operating system's randomness pool
then randomness can temporarily be unavailable. \f(CW\*(C`/dev/random\*(C'\fR solves
this problem by waiting until enough randomness can be gathered \- and
this can take a long time since blocking reduces activity in the
machine and less activity provides less random events: a vicious circle.
\&\f(CW\*(C`/dev/urandom\*(C'\fR solves this dilemma more pragmatically by simply returning
predictable \*(L"random\*(R" numbers. Some\f(CW\*(C` /dev/urandom\*(C'\fR emulation software
however actually seems to implement \f(CW\*(C`/dev/random\*(C'\fR semantics. Caveat emptor.

If you are using the low level \s-1API\s0 functions to communicate with other
\&\s-1SSL\s0 implementations, you would do well to call
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_options($ctx, &Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL)
\&         or die_if_ssl_error("ssl ctx set options");
.Ve
.PP
to cope with some well know bugs in some other \s-1SSL\s0
implementations. The high level \s-1API\s0 functions always set all known
compatibility options.
.PP
Sometimes \f(CW\*(C`sslcat()\*(C'\fR (and the high level \s-1HTTPS\s0 functions that build on it)
is too fast in signaling the \s-1EOF\s0 to legacy \s-1HTTPS\s0 servers. This causes
the server to return empty page. To work around this problem you can
set the global variable
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $Net::SSLeay::slowly = 1;   # Add sleep so broken servers can keep up
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1HTTP/1.1\s0 is not supported. Specifically this module does not know to
issue or serve multiple http requests per connection. This is a serious
shortcoming, but using the \s-1SSL\s0 session cache on your server helps to
alleviate the \s-1CPU\s0 load somewhat.
.PP
As of version 1.09 many newer OpenSSL auxiliary functions were
added (from \f(CW\*(C`REM_AUTOMATICALLY_GENERATED_1_09\*(C'\fR onwards in \f(CW\*(C`SSLeay.xs\*(C'\fR).
Unfortunately I have not had any opportunity to test these. Some of
them are trivial enough that I believe they \*(L"just work\*(R", but others
have rather complex interfaces with function pointers and all. In these
cases you should proceed wit great caution.
.PP
This module defaults to using OpenSSL automatic protocol negotiation
code for automatically detecting the version of the \s-1SSL\s0 protocol
that the other end talks. With most web servers this works just
fine, but once in a while I get complaints from people that the module
does not work with some web servers. Usually this can be solved
by explicitly setting the protocol version, e.g.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 2;  # Insist on SSLv2
\&   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 3;  # Insist on SSLv3
\&   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 10; # Insist on TLSv1
.Ve
.PP
Although the autonegotiation is nice to have, the \s-1SSL\s0 standards
do not formally specify any such mechanism. Most of the world has
accepted the SSLeay/OpenSSL way of doing it as the de facto standard. But
for the few that think differently, you have to explicitly speak
the correct version. This is not really a bug, but rather a deficiency
in the standards. If a site refuses to respond or sends back some
nonsensical error codes (at the \s-1SSL\s0 handshake level), try this option
before mailing me.
.PP
On some systems, OpenSSL may be compiled without support for SSLv2.
If this is the case, Net::SSLeay will warn if ssl_version has been set
to 2.
.PP
The high level \s-1API\s0 returns the certificate of the peer, thus allowing
one to check what certificate was supplied. However, you will only be
able to check the certificate after the fact, i.e. you already sent
your form data by the time you find out that you did not trust them,
oops.
.PP
So, while being able to know the certificate after the fact is surely
useful, the security minded would still choose to do the connection
and certificate verification first and only then exchange data
with the site. Currently none of the high level \s-1API\s0 functions do
this, thus you would have to program it using the low level \s-1API. A\s0
good place to start is to see how the \f(CW\*(C`Net::SSLeay::http_cat()\*(C'\fR function
is implemented.
.PP
The high level \s-1API\s0 functions use a global file handle \f(CW\*(C`SSLCAT_S\*(C'\fR
internally. This really should not be a problem because there is no
way to interleave the high level \s-1API\s0 functions, unless you use threads
(but threads are not very well supported in perl anyway (as of version
5.6.1). However, you may run into problems if you call undocumented
internal functions in an interleaved fashion. The best solution is to \*(L"require Net::SSLeay\*(R"
in one thread after all the threads have been created.

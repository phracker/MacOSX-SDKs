.IP "Haskell" 4
.IX Item "Haskell"
There are two types of comments in \fIHaskell\fR. They either start with
at least two dashes, or are nested comments, delimited with \f(CW\*(C`{\-\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-}\*(C'\fR.
Under \f(CW\*(C`{\-keep}\*(C'\fR, only \f(CW$1\fR will be set, returning the entire comment.
This pattern requires \fIperl 5.6.0\fR or newer.
.IP "\s-1HTML\s0" 4
.IX Item "HTML"
In \fI\s-1HTML\s0\fR, comments only appear inside a \fIcomment declaration\fR.
A comment declaration starts with a \f(CW\*(C`<!\*(C'\fR, and ends with a
\&\f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR. Inside this declaration, we have zero or more comments.
Comments starts with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR and end with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR, and are optionally
followed by whitespace. The pattern \f(CW$RE{comment}{HTML}\fR recognizes
those comment declarations (and hence more than a comment).
Note that this is not the same as something that starts with
\&\f(CW\*(C`<!\-\-\*(C'\fR and ends with \f(CW\*(C`\-\->\*(C'\fR, because the following will
be matched completely:
.Sp
.Vb 3

\&      \-\-  Third  Comment   \-\->

.Sp
Do not be fooled by what your favourite browser thinks is an \s-1HTML\s0
comment.

Those characters default to a space, but that's configurable. This
requirement, of preceding the comment with linestart characters is

There are many implementations of Pascal. This modules provides
pattern for comments of several implementations.
.RS 4
.ie n .IP "$RE{comment}{Pascal}" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$RE{comment}{Pascal}\fR" 4
.IX Item "$RE{comment}{Pascal}"
This is the pattern that recognizes comments according to the Pascal \s-1ISO \s0
standard. This standard says that comments start with either \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`(*\*(C'\fR, and end with \f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`*)\*(C'\fR. This means that \f(CW\*(C`{*)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`(*}\*(C'\fR
are considered to be comments. Many Pascal applications don't allow this.
See <http://www.pascal\-central.com/docs/iso10206.txt>

.IX Item "$RE{comment}{Pascal}{Delphi}, $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Free} and $RE{comment}{Pascal}{GPC}"
The \fIDelphi Pascal\fR, \fIFree Pascal\fR and the \fIGnu Pascal Compiler\fR
implementations of Pascal all have comments that either start with
\&\f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR and last till the end of the line, are delimited with \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR or are delimited with \f(CW\*(C`(*\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`*)\*(C'\fR. Patterns for those
comments are given by \f(CW$RE{comment}{Pascal}{Delphi}\fR, 
\&\f(CW$RE{comment}{Pascal}{Free}\fR and \f(CW$RE{comment}{Pascal}{GPC}\fR
respectively. These patterns only set \f(CW$1\fR when \f(CW\*(C`{\-keep}\*(C'\fR is used,
which will then include the entire comment.

and ending with a double quote (\f(CW\*(C`"\*(C'\fR). When \f(CW\*(C`{\-keep}\*(C'\fR is used,
only \f(CW$1\fR is set, and returns the entire comment.

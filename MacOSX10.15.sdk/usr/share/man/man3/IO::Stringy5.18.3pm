.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both traditional
and object-oriented i/o) on things \fIother\fR than normal filehandles;
in particular, IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray,
and IO::Lines.
.PP
In the more-traditional IO::Handle front, we
have IO::AtomicFile
which may be used to painlessly create files which are updated
atomically.
.PP
And in the \*(L"this-may-prove-useful\*(R" corner, we have IO::Wrap,
whose exported \fIwraphandle()\fR function will clothe anything that's not
a blessed object in an IO::Handle\-like wrapper... so you can just
use \s-1OO\s0 syntax and stop worrying about whether your function's caller
handed you a string, a globref, or a FileHandle.
.SH "WARNINGS"
.IX Header "WARNINGS"
Perl's \s-1TIEHANDLE\s0 spec was incomplete prior to 5.005_57;
it was missing support for \f(CW\*(C`seek()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`tell()\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`eof()\*(C'\fR.
Attempting to use these functions with an IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray,
IO::Lines, etc. \fBwill not work\fR prior to 5.005_57.
None of the relevant methods will be invoked by Perl;
and even worse, this kind of bug can lie dormant for a while.
If you turn warnings on (via \f(CW$^W\fR or \f(CW\*(C`perl \-w\*(C'\fR), and you see
something like this...
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    seek() on unopened file
.Ve
.PP
\&...then you are probably trying to use one of these functions
on one of our \s-1IO::\s0 classes with an old Perl.  The remedy is to simply
use the \s-1OO\s0 version; e.g.:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $SH\->seek(0,0);    ### GOOD: will work on any 5.005
\&    seek($SH,0,0);     ### WARNING: will only work on 5.005_57 and beyond
.Ve
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.IX Header "INSTALLATION"
.SS "Requirements"
.IX Subsection "Requirements"
As of version 2.x, this toolkit requires Perl 5.005 for
the IO::Handle subclasses, and 5.005_57 or better is
\&\fBstrongly\fR recommended.  See \*(L"\s-1WARNINGS\*(R"\s0 for details.
.SS "Directions"
.IX Subsection "Directions"
Most of you already know the drill...
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    perl Makefile.PL
\&    make
\&    make test
\&    make install
.Ve
.PP
For everyone else out there...
if you've never installed Perl code before, or you're trying to use
this in an environment where your sysadmin or \s-1ISP\s0 won't let you do
interesting things, \fBrelax:\fR since this module contains no binary
extensions, you can cheat.  That means copying the directory tree
under my \*(L"./lib\*(R" directory into someplace where your script can \*(L"see\*(R"
it.  For example, under Linux:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    cp \-r IO\-stringy\-1.234/lib/* /path/to/my/perl/
.Ve
.PP
Now, in your Perl code, do this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use lib "/path/to/my/perl";
\&    use IO::Scalar;                   ### or whatever
.Ve
.PP
Ok, now you've been told.  At this point, anyone who whines about
not being given enough information gets an unflattering haiku
written about them in the next change log.  I'll do it.
Don't think I won't.

Will the sudden sensitivity to $/ hose anyone out there?
I'm worried, so you have to enable it explicitly in 1.x.
It will be on by default in 2.x, though only IO::Scalar
has been implemented.

It's not needed.  Backwards compatibility could be maintained
by having \fInew_tie()\fR be identical to \fInew()\fR.  Heck, I'll bet
that IO::WrapTie should be reimplemented so the returned
object is just like an IO::Scalar in its use of globrefs.

.IP "Version 2.103   (2001/08/08)" 4
.IX Item "Version 2.103 (2001/08/08)"
After sober consideration I have reimplemented \fIIO::Scalar::print()\fR
so that it once again always seeks to the end of the string.
Benchmarks show the new implementation to be just as fast as
Juergen's contributed patch; until someone can convince me otherwise,
the current, safer implementation stays.
.Sp
I thought more about giving IO::Scalar two separate handles,
one for reading and one for writing, as suggested by Binkley.
His points about what \fItell()\fR and \fIeof()\fR return are, I think,
show-stoppers for this feature.  Even the manpages for stdio's \fIfseek()\fR
seem to imply a \fIsingle\fR file position indicator, not two.
So I think I will take this off the \s-1TO DO\s0 list.
\&\fBRemedy:\fR you can always have two handles open on the same
scalar, one which you only write to, and one which you only read from.
That should give the same effect.
.IP "Version 2.101   (2001/08/07)" 4

\&\fBAlpha release.\fR
This is the initial release of the \*(L"IO::Scalar and friends are
now subclasses of IO::Handle\*(R".  I'm flinging it against the wall.
Please tell me if the banana sticks.  When it does, the banana
will be called 2.2x.
.Sp
First off, \fImany many thanks to Doug Wilson\fR, who
has provided an \fIinvaluable\fR service by patching IO::Scalar
and friends so that they (1) inherit from IO::Handle, (2) automatically
tie themselves so that the \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR objects can be used in native i/o
constructs, and (3) doing it so that the whole damn thing passes
its regression tests.  As Doug knows, my globref Kung-Fu was not
up to the task; he graciously provided the patches.  This has earned
him a seat at the Co-Authors table, and the
right to have me address him as \fIsensei\fR.
.Sp
Performance of \fIIO::Scalar::print()\fR has been improved by as much as 2x
for lots of little prints, with the cost of forcing those
who print-then-seek-then-print to explicitly seek to end-of-string
before printing again.
\&\fIThanks to Juergen Zeller for this patch.\fR
.Sp
Added the \s-1COPYING\s0 file, which had been missing from prior versions.
\&\fIThanks to Albert Chin-A-Young for pointing this out.\fR

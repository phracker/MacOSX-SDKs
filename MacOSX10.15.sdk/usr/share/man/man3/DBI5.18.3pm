The \s-1DBI\s0 is evolving at a steady pace, so it's good to check that
you have the latest copy.

.PP
Some \s-1DBI\s0 changes require changes in the drivers, but the drivers
can take some time to catch up. Newer versions of the \s-1DBI\s0 have
added features that may not yet be supported by the drivers you
use.  Talk to the authors of your drivers if you need a new feature
that is not yet supported.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1DBI\s0 is a database access module for the Perl programming language.  It defines
a set of methods, variables, and conventions that provide a consistent
database interface, independent of the actual database being used.
.PP
It is important to remember that the \s-1DBI\s0 is just an interface.
The \s-1DBI\s0 is a layer
of \*(L"glue\*(R" between an application and one or more database \fIdriver\fR
modules.  It is the driver modules which do most of the real work. The \s-1DBI\s0
provides a standard interface and framework for the drivers to operate
within.
.PP
This document often uses terms like \fIreferences\fR, \fIobjects\fR,
\&\fImethods\fR.  If you're not familiar with those terms then it would
be a good idea to read at least the following perl manuals first:
perlreftut, perldsc, perllol, and perlboot.

.PP
The \s-1API,\s0 or Application Programming Interface, defines the
call interface and variables for Perl scripts to use. The \s-1API\s0
is implemented by the Perl \s-1DBI\s0 extension.
.PP
The \s-1DBI \s0\*(L"dispatches\*(R" the method calls to the appropriate driver for
actual execution.  The \s-1DBI\s0 is also responsible for the dynamic loading
of drivers, error checking and handling, providing default
implementations for methods, and many other non-database specific duties.
.PP
Each driver
contains implementations of the \s-1DBI\s0 methods using the
private interface functions of the corresponding database engine.  Only authors
of sophisticated/multi\-database applications or generic library
functions need be concerned with drivers.
.SS "Notation and Conventions"
.IX Subsection "Notation and Conventions"
The following conventions are used in this document:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&  $dbh    Database handle object
\&  $sth    Statement handle object
\&  $drh    Driver handle object (rarely seen or used in applications)
\&  $h      Any of the handle types above ($dbh, $sth, or $drh)
\&  $rc     General Return Code  (boolean: true=ok, false=error)
\&  $rv     General Return Value (typically an integer)
\&  @ary    List of values returned from the database, typically a row of data
\&  $rows   Number of rows processed (if available, else \-1)
\&  $fh     A filehandle
\&  undef   NULL values are represented by undefined values in Perl
\&  \e%attr  Reference to a hash of attribute values passed to methods
.Ve
.PP
Note that Perl will automatically destroy database and statement handle objects
if all references to them are deleted.
.SS "Outline Usage"
.IX Subsection "Outline Usage"
To use \s-1DBI,\s0
first you need to load the \s-1DBI\s0 module:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use DBI;
\&  use strict;
.Ve
.PP
(The \f(CW\*(C`use strict;\*(C'\fR isn't required but is strongly recommended.)
.PP
Then you need to \*(L"connect\*(R" to your data source and get a \fIhandle\fR for that
connection:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect($dsn, $user, $password,
\&                      { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 0 });
.Ve
.PP
Since connecting can be expensive, you generally just connect at the
start of your program and disconnect at the end.
.PP
Explicitly defining the required \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR behaviour is strongly
recommended and may become mandatory in a later version.  This
determines whether changes are automatically committed to the
database when executed, or need to be explicitly committed later.
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 allows an application to \*(L"prepare\*(R" statements for later
execution.  A prepared statement is identified by a statement handle
held in a Perl variable.
We'll call the Perl variable \f(CW$sth\fR in our examples.
.PP
The typical method call sequence for a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement is:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  prepare,
\&    execute, fetch, fetch, ...
\&    execute, fetch, fetch, ...
\&    execute, fetch, fetch, ...
.Ve
.PP
for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare("SELECT foo, bar FROM table WHERE baz=?");
\&
\&  $sth\->execute( $baz );
\&
\&  while ( @row = $sth\->fetchrow_array ) {
\&    print "@row\en";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
The typical method call sequence for a \fInon\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement is:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  prepare,
\&    execute,
\&    execute,
\&    execute.
.Ve
.PP
for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare("INSERT INTO table(foo,bar,baz) VALUES (?,?,?)");
\&
\&  while(<CSV>) {
\&    chomp;
\&    my ($foo,$bar,$baz) = split /,/;
\&        $sth\->execute( $foo, $bar, $baz );
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`do()\*(C'\fR method can be used for non repeated \fInon\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement
(or with drivers that don't support placeholders):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $rows_affected = $dbh\->do("UPDATE your_table SET foo = foo + 1");
.Ve
.PP
To commit your changes to the database (when \*(L"AutoCommit\*(R" is off):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->commit;  # or call $dbh\->rollback; to undo changes
.Ve
.PP
Finally, when you have finished working with the data source, you should
\&\*(L"disconnect\*(R" from it:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->disconnect;
.Ve
.SS "General Interface Rules & Caveats"
.IX Subsection "General Interface Rules & Caveats"
The \s-1DBI\s0 does not have a concept of a \*(L"current session\*(R". Every session
has a handle object (i.e., a \f(CW$dbh\fR) returned from the \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR method.
That handle object is used to invoke database related methods.
.PP
Most data is returned to the Perl script as strings. (Null values are
returned as \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.)  This allows arbitrary precision numeric data to be
handled without loss of accuracy.  Beware that Perl may not preserve
the same accuracy when the string is used as a number.
.PP
Dates and times are returned as character strings in the current
default format of the corresponding database engine.  Time zone effects
are database/driver dependent.
.PP
Perl supports binary data in Perl strings, and the \s-1DBI\s0 will pass binary
data to and from the driver without change. It is up to the driver
implementors to decide how they wish to handle such binary data.
.PP
Perl supports two kinds of strings: Unicode (utf8 internally) and non-Unicode
(defaults to iso\-8859\-1 if forced to assume an encoding).  Drivers should
accept both kinds of strings and, if required, convert them to the character
set of the database being used. Similarly, when fetching from the database
character data that isn't iso\-8859\-1 the driver should convert it into utf8.
.PP
Multiple \s-1SQL\s0 statements may not be combined in a single statement
handle (\f(CW$sth\fR), although some databases and drivers do support this
(notably Sybase and \s-1SQL\s0 Server).
.PP
Non-sequential record reads are not supported in this version of the \s-1DBI.\s0
In other words, records can only be fetched in the order that the
database returned them, and once fetched they are forgotten.
.PP
Positioned updates and deletes are not directly supported by the \s-1DBI.\s0
See the description of the \f(CW\*(C`CursorName\*(C'\fR attribute for an alternative.
.PP
Individual driver implementors are free to provide any private
functions and/or handle attributes that they feel are useful.
Private driver functions can be invoked using the \s-1DBI \s0\f(CW\*(C`func()\*(C'\fR method.
Private driver attributes are accessed just like standard attributes.
.PP
Many methods have an optional \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter which can be used to
pass information to the driver implementing the method. Except where
specifically documented, the \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter can only be used to pass
driver specific hints. In general, you can ignore \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameters
or pass it as \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Naming Conventions and Name Space"
.IX Subsection "Naming Conventions and Name Space"
The \s-1DBI\s0 package and all packages below it (\f(CW\*(C`DBI::*\*(C'\fR) are reserved for
use by the \s-1DBI.\s0 Extensions and related modules use the \f(CW\*(C`DBIx::\*(C'\fR
namespace (see <http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by\-module/DBIx/>).
Package names beginning with \f(CW\*(C`DBD::\*(C'\fR are reserved for use
by \s-1DBI\s0 database drivers.  All environment variables used by the \s-1DBI\s0
or by individual DBDs begin with "\f(CW\*(C`DBI_\*(C'\fR\*(L" or \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`DBD_\*(C'\fR".
.PP
The letter case used for attribute names is significant and plays an
important part in the portability of \s-1DBI\s0 scripts.  The case of the
attribute name is used to signify who defined the meaning of that name
and its values.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  Case of name  Has a meaning defined by
\&  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&  UPPER_CASE    Standards, e.g.,  X/Open, ISO SQL92 etc (portable)
\&  MixedCase     DBI API (portable), underscores are not used.
\&  lower_case    Driver or database engine specific (non\-portable)
.Ve
.PP
It is of the utmost importance that Driver developers only use
lowercase attribute names when defining private attributes. Private
attribute names must be prefixed with the driver name or suitable
abbreviation (e.g., "\f(CW\*(C`ora_\*(C'\fR\*(L" for Oracle, \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`ing_\*(C'\fR" for Ingres, etc).
.SS "\s-1SQL \- A\s0 Query Language"
.IX Subsection "SQL - A Query Language"
Most \s-1DBI\s0 drivers require applications to use a dialect of \s-1SQL
\&\s0(Structured Query Language) to interact with the database engine.
The \*(L"Standards Reference Information\*(R" section provides links
to useful information about \s-1SQL.\s0
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 itself does not mandate or require any particular language to
be used; it is language independent. In \s-1ODBC\s0 terms, the \s-1DBI\s0 is in
\&\*(L"pass-thru\*(R" mode, although individual drivers might not be. The only requirement
is that queries and other statements must be expressed as a single

.SS "Placeholders and Bind Values"
.IX Subsection "Placeholders and Bind Values"
Some drivers support placeholders and bind values.
\&\fIPlaceholders\fR, also called parameter markers, are used to indicate
values in a database statement that will be supplied later,
before the prepared statement is executed.  For example, an application
might use the following to insert a row of data into the \s-1SALES\s0 table:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  INSERT INTO sales (product_code, qty, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
.Ve
.PP
or the following, to select the description for a product:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  SELECT description FROM products WHERE product_code = ?
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR characters are the placeholders.  The association of actual
values with placeholders is known as \fIbinding\fR, and the values are
referred to as \fIbind values\fR.
Note that the \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR is not enclosed in quotation marks, even when the
placeholder represents a string.
.PP
Some drivers also allow placeholders like \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR\fIname\fR and \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR\fIN\fR (e.g.,
\&\f(CW\*(C`:1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`:2\*(C'\fR, and so on) in addition to \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR, but their use is not portable.
.PP
If the \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR\fIN\fR form of placeholder is supported by the driver you're using,
then you should be able to use either \*(L"bind_param\*(R" or \*(L"execute\*(R" to bind
values. Check your driver documentation.
.PP
With most drivers, placeholders can't be used for any element of a
statement that would prevent the database server from validating the
statement and creating a query execution plan for it. For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  "SELECT name, age FROM ?"         # wrong (will probably fail)
\&  "SELECT name, ?   FROM people"    # wrong (but may not \*(Aqfail\*(Aq)
.Ve
.PP
Also, placeholders can only represent single scalar values.
For example, the following
statement won't work as expected for more than one value:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  "SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name IN (?)"    # wrong
\&  "SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name IN (?,?)"  # two names
.Ve
.PP
When using placeholders with the \s-1SQL \s0\f(CW\*(C`LIKE\*(C'\fR qualifier, you must
remember that the placeholder substitutes for the whole string.
So you should use "\f(CW\*(C`... LIKE ? ...\*(C'\fR" and include any wildcard
characters in the value that you bind to the placeholder.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NULL\s0 Values\fR
.PP
Undefined values, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, are used to indicate \s-1NULL\s0 values.
You can insert and update columns with a \s-1NULL\s0 value as you would a
non-NULL value.  These examples insert and update the column
\&\f(CW\*(C`age\*(C'\fR with a \s-1NULL\s0 value:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(qq{
\&    INSERT INTO people (fullname, age) VALUES (?, ?)
\&  });
\&  $sth\->execute("Joe Bloggs", undef);
\&
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(qq{
\&    UPDATE people SET age = ? WHERE fullname = ?
\&  });
\&  $sth\->execute(undef, "Joe Bloggs");
.Ve
.PP
However, care must be taken when trying to use \s-1NULL\s0 values in a
\&\f(CW\*(C`WHERE\*(C'\fR clause.  Consider:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  SELECT fullname FROM people WHERE age = ?
.Ve
.PP
Binding an \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR (\s-1NULL\s0) to the placeholder will \fInot\fR select rows
which have a \s-1NULL \s0\f(CW\*(C`age\*(C'\fR!  At least for database engines that
conform to the \s-1SQL\s0 standard.  Refer to the \s-1SQL\s0 manual for your database
engine or any \s-1SQL\s0 book for the reasons for this.  To explicitly select
NULLs you have to say "\f(CW\*(C`WHERE age IS NULL\*(C'\fR".
.PP
A common issue is to have a code fragment handle a value that could be
either \f(CW\*(C`defined\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR (non-NULL or \s-1NULL\s0) at runtime.
A simple technique is to prepare the appropriate statement as needed,
and substitute the placeholder for non-NULL cases:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  $sql_clause = defined $age? "age = ?" : "age IS NULL";
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(qq{
\&    SELECT fullname FROM people WHERE $sql_clause
\&  });
\&  $sth\->execute(defined $age ? $age : ());
.Ve
.PP
The following technique illustrates qualifying a \f(CW\*(C`WHERE\*(C'\fR clause with
several columns, whose associated values (\f(CW\*(C`defined\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR) are
in a hash \f(CW%h:\fR
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  for my $col ("age", "phone", "email") {
\&    if (defined $h{$col}) {
\&      push @sql_qual, "$col = ?";
\&      push @sql_bind, $h{$col};
\&    }
\&    else {
\&      push @sql_qual, "$col IS NULL";
\&    }
\&  }
\&  $sql_clause = join(" AND ", @sql_qual);
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(qq{
\&      SELECT fullname FROM people WHERE $sql_clause
\&  });
\&  $sth\->execute(@sql_bind);
.Ve
.PP
The techniques above call prepare for the \s-1SQL\s0 statement with each call to
execute.  Because calls to \fIprepare()\fR can be expensive, performance
can suffer when an application iterates many times over statements
like the above.
.PP
A better solution is a single \f(CW\*(C`WHERE\*(C'\fR clause that supports both
\&\s-1NULL\s0 and non-NULL comparisons.  Its \s-1SQL\s0 statement would need to be
prepared only once for all cases, thus improving performance.
Several examples of \f(CW\*(C`WHERE\*(C'\fR clauses that support this are presented
below.  But each example lacks portability, robustness, or simplicity.
Whether an example is supported on your database engine depends on
what \s-1SQL\s0 extensions it provides, and where it supports the \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR
placeholder in a statement.
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  0)  age = ?
\&  1)  NVL(age, xx) = NVL(?, xx)
\&  2)  ISNULL(age, xx) = ISNULL(?, xx)
\&  3)  DECODE(age, ?, 1, 0) = 1
\&  4)  age = ? OR (age IS NULL AND ? IS NULL)
\&  5)  age = ? OR (age IS NULL AND SP_ISNULL(?) = 1)
\&  6)  age = ? OR (age IS NULL AND ? = 1)
.Ve
.PP
Statements formed with the above \f(CW\*(C`WHERE\*(C'\fR clauses require execute
statements as follows.  The arguments are required, whether their
values are \f(CW\*(C`defined\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  0,1,2,3)  $sth\->execute($age);
\&  4,5)      $sth\->execute($age, $age);
\&  6)        $sth\->execute($age, defined($age) ? 0 : 1);
.Ve
.PP
Example 0 should not work (as mentioned earlier), but may work on
a few database engines anyway (e.g. Sybase).  Example 0 is part
of examples 4, 5, and 6, so if example 0 works, these other
examples may work, even if the engine does not properly support
the right hand side of the \f(CW\*(C`OR\*(C'\fR expression.
.PP
Examples 1 and 2 are not robust: they require that you provide a
valid column value xx (e.g. '~') which is not present in any row.
That means you must have some notion of what data won't be stored
in the column, and expect clients to adhere to that.
.PP
Example 5 requires that you provide a stored procedure (\s-1SP_ISNULL\s0
in this example) that acts as a function: it checks whether a value
is null, and returns 1 if it is, or 0 if not.
.PP
Example 6, the least simple, is probably the most portable, i.e., it
should work with most, if not all, database engines.
.PP
Here is a table that indicates which examples above are known to
work on various database engines:

Without using placeholders, the insert statement shown previously would have to
contain the literal values to be inserted and would have to be
re-prepared and re-executed for each row. With placeholders, the insert
statement only needs to be prepared once. The bind values for each row
can be given to the \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR method each time it's called. By avoiding
the need to re-prepare the statement for each row, the application
typically runs many times faster. Here's an example:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&  my $sth = $dbh\->prepare(q{
\&    INSERT INTO sales (product_code, qty, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
\&  }) or die $dbh\->errstr;
\&  while (<>) {
\&      chomp;
\&      my ($product_code, $qty, $price) = split /,/;
\&      $sth\->execute($product_code, $qty, $price) or die $dbh\->errstr;
\&  }
\&  $dbh\->commit or die $dbh\->errstr;
.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"execute\*(R" and \*(L"bind_param\*(R" for more details.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`q{...}\*(C'\fR style quoting used in this example avoids clashing with
quotes that may be used in the \s-1SQL\s0 statement. Use the double-quote like
\&\f(CW\*(C`qq{...}\*(C'\fR operator if you want to interpolate variables into the string.
See \*(L"Quote and Quote-like Operators\*(R" in perlop for more details.

Constants representing the values of the \s-1SQL\s0 standard types can be

.Ve
.PP
These constants are defined by \s-1SQL/CLI, ODBC\s0 or both.

\&  ($scheme, $driver, $attr_string, $attr_hash, $driver_dsn) = DBI\->parse_dsn($dsn)

.Ve
.PP
Breaks apart a \s-1DBI\s0 Data Source Name (\s-1DSN\s0) and returns the individual
parts. If \f(CW$dsn\fR doesn't contain a valid \s-1DSN\s0 then \fIparse_dsn()\fR returns
an empty list.
.PP
\&\f(CW$scheme\fR is the first part of the \s-1DSN\s0 and is currently always 'dbi'.
\&\f(CW$driver\fR is the driver name, possibly defaulted to \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1DBI_DRIVER\s0},
and may be undefined.  \f(CW$attr_string\fR is the contents of the optional attribute
string, which may be undefined.  If \f(CW$attr_string\fR is not empty then \f(CW$attr_hash\fR
is a reference to a hash containing the parsed attribute names and values.
\&\f(CW$driver_dsn\fR is the last part of the \s-1DBI DSN\s0 string. For example:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  ($scheme, $driver, $attr_string, $attr_hash, $driver_dsn)
\&      = DBI\->parse_dsn("DBI:MyDriver(RaiseError=>1):db=test;port=42");

Establishes a database connection, or session, to the requested \f(CW$data_source\fR.
Returns a database handle object if the connection succeeds. Use
\&\f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->disconnect\*(C'\fR to terminate the connection.
.PP
If the connect fails (see below), it returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR and sets both \f(CW$DBI::err\fR
and \f(CW$DBI::errstr\fR. (It does \fInot\fR explicitly set \f(CW$!\fR.) You should generally
test the return status of \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`print $DBI::errstr\*(C'\fR if it has failed.
.PP
Multiple simultaneous connections to multiple databases through multiple
drivers can be made via the \s-1DBI.\s0 Simply make one \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR call for each
database and keep a copy of each returned database handle.
.PP
The \f(CW$data_source\fR value must begin with "\f(CW\*(C`dbi:\*(C'\fR\fIdriver_name\fR\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR".
The \fIdriver_name\fR specifies the driver that will be used to make the
connection. (Letter case is significant.)
.PP
As a convenience, if the \f(CW$data_source\fR parameter is undefined or empty,
the \s-1DBI\s0 will substitute the value of the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`DBI_DSN\*(C'\fR.
If just the \fIdriver_name\fR part is empty (i.e., the \f(CW$data_source\fR
prefix is "\f(CW\*(C`dbi::\*(C'\fR"), the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`DBI_DRIVER\*(C'\fR is
used. If neither variable is set, then \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR dies.
.PP
Examples of \f(CW$data_source\fR values are:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  dbi:DriverName:database_name
\&  dbi:DriverName:database_name@hostname:port
\&  dbi:DriverName:database=database_name;host=hostname;port=port
.Ve
.PP
There is \fIno standard\fR for the text following the driver name. Each
driver is free to use whatever syntax it wants. The only requirement the
\&\s-1DBI\s0 makes is that all the information is supplied in a single string.
You must consult the documentation for the drivers you are using for a
description of the syntax they require.
.PP
It is recommended that drivers support the \s-1ODBC\s0 style, shown in the
last example above. It is also recommended that they support the
three common names '\f(CW\*(C`host\*(C'\fR', '\f(CW\*(C`port\*(C'\fR', and '\f(CW\*(C`database\*(C'\fR' (plus '\f(CW\*(C`db\*(C'\fR'
as an alias for \f(CW\*(C`database\*(C'\fR). This simplifies automatic construction
of basic DSNs: \f(CW"dbi:$driver:database=$db;host=$host;port=$port"\fR.
Drivers should aim to 'do something reasonable' when given a \s-1DSN\s0
in this form, but if any part is meaningless for that driver (such
as 'port' for Informix) it should generate an error if that part
is not empty.
.PP
If the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`DBI_AUTOPROXY\*(C'\fR is defined (and the
driver in \f(CW$data_source\fR is not "\f(CW\*(C`Proxy\*(C'\fR") then the connect request
will automatically be changed to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $ENV{DBI_AUTOPROXY};dsn=$data_source
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`DBI_AUTOPROXY\*(C'\fR is typically set as "\f(CW\*(C`dbi:Proxy:hostname=...;port=...\*(C'\fR".
If \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1DBI_AUTOPROXY\s0} doesn't begin with '\f(CW\*(C`dbi:\*(C'\fR' then \*(L"dbi:Proxy:\*(R"
will be prepended to it first.  See the DBD::Proxy documentation
for more details.
.PP
If \f(CW$username\fR or \f(CW$password\fR are undefined (rather than just empty),
then the \s-1DBI\s0 will substitute the values of the \f(CW\*(C`DBI_USER\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DBI_PASS\*(C'\fR
environment variables, respectively.  The \s-1DBI\s0 will warn if the
environment variables are not defined.  However, the everyday use
of these environment variables is not recommended for security
reasons. The mechanism is primarily intended to simplify testing.
See below for alternative way to specify the username and password.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`DBI\->connect\*(C'\fR automatically installs the driver if it has not been
installed yet. Driver installation either returns a valid driver
handle, or it \fIdies\fR with an error message that includes the string
"\f(CW\*(C`install_driver\*(C'\fR" and the underlying problem. So \f(CW\*(C`DBI\->connect\*(C'\fR
will die
on a driver installation failure and will only return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on a
connect failure, in which case \f(CW$DBI::errstr\fR will hold the error message.
Use \f(CW\*(C`eval { ... }\*(C'\fR if you need to catch the "\f(CW\*(C`install_driver\*(C'\fR" error.
.PP
The \f(CW$data_source\fR argument (with the "\f(CW\*(C`dbi:...:\*(C'\fR" prefix removed) and the
\&\f(CW$username\fR and \f(CW$password\fR arguments are then passed to the driver for
processing. The \s-1DBI\s0 does not define any interpretation for the
contents of these fields.  The driver is free to interpret the
\&\f(CW$data_source\fR, \f(CW$username\fR, and \f(CW$password\fR fields in any way, and supply
whatever defaults are appropriate for the engine being accessed.
(Oracle, for example, uses the \s-1ORACLE_SID\s0 and \s-1TWO_TASK\s0 environment
variables if no \f(CW$data_source\fR is specified.)
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR attributes for each connection
default to \*(L"on\*(R". (See \*(L"AutoCommit\*(R" and \*(L"PrintError\*(R" for more information.)
However, it is strongly recommended that you explicitly define \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR
rather than rely on the default. The \f(CW\*(C`PrintWarn\*(C'\fR attribute defaults to true.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter can be used to alter the default settings of
\&\f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR, and other attributes. For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect($data_source, $user, $pass, {
\&        PrintError => 0,
\&        AutoCommit => 0
\&  });
.Ve
.PP
The username and password can also be specified using the attributes
\&\f(CW\*(C`Username\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Password\*(C'\fR, in which case they take precedence
over the \f(CW$username\fR and \f(CW$password\fR parameters.
.PP
You can also define connection attribute values within the \f(CW$data_source\fR
parameter. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  dbi:DriverName(PrintWarn=>0,PrintError=>0,Taint=>1):...
.Ve
.PP
Individual attributes values specified in this way take precedence over
any conflicting values specified via the \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter to \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`dbi_connect_method\*(C'\fR attribute can be used to specify which driver
method should be called to establish the connection. The only useful
values are 'connect', 'connect_cached', or some specialized case like
\&'Apache::DBI::connect' (which is automatically the default when running
within Apache).
.PP
Where possible, each session (\f(CW$dbh\fR) is independent from the transactions
in other sessions. This is useful when you need to hold cursors open
across transactions\*(--for example, if you use one session for your long lifespan
cursors (typically read-only) and another for your short update
transactions.
.PP
For compatibility with old \s-1DBI\s0 scripts, the driver can be specified by
passing its name as the fourth argument to \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR (instead of \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR):

In this \*(L"old-style\*(R" form of \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR, the \f(CW$data_source\fR should not start
with "\f(CW\*(C`dbi:driver_name:\*(C'\fR". (If it does, the embedded driver_name
will be ignored). Also note that in this older form of \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR,
the \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->{AutoCommit}\*(C'\fR attribute is \fIundefined\fR, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->{PrintError}\*(C'\fR attribute is off, and the old \f(CW\*(C`DBI_DBNAME\*(C'\fR
environment variable is
checked if \f(CW\*(C`DBI_DSN\*(C'\fR is not defined. Beware that this \*(L"old-style\*(R"

Note that the behaviour of this method differs in several respects from the

Caching connections can be useful in some applications, but it can
also cause problems, such as too many connections, and so should
be used with care. In particular, avoid changing the attributes of
a database handle created via \fIconnect_cached()\fR because it will affect
other code that may be using the same handle. When \fIconnect_cached()\fR
returns a handle the attributes will be reset to their initial values.
This can cause problems, especially with the \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR attribute.
.PP
Also, to ensure that the attributes passed are always the same, avoid passing
references inline. For example, the \f(CW\*(C`Callbacks\*(C'\fR attribute is specified as a
hash reference. Be sure to declare it external to the call to
\&\fIconnect_cached()\fR, such that the hash reference is not re-created on every
call. A package-level lexical works well:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  package MyDBH;
\&  my $cb = {
\&      \*(Aqconnect_cached.reused\*(Aq => sub { delete $_[4]\->{AutoCommit} },
\&  };
\&
\&  sub dbh {
\&      DBI\->connect_cached( $dsn, $username, $auth, { Callbacks => $cb });
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Where multiple separate parts of a program are using \fIconnect_cached()\fR
to connect to the same database with the same (initial) attributes
it is a good idea to add a private attribute to the \fIconnect_cached()\fR
call to effectively limit the scope of the caching. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  DBI\->connect_cached(..., { private_foo_cachekey => "Bar", ... });
.Ve
.PP
Handles returned from that \fIconnect_cached()\fR call will only be returned
by other \fIconnect_cached()\fR call elsewhere in the code if those other
calls also pass in the same attribute values, including the private one.
(I've used \f(CW\*(C`private_foo_cachekey\*(C'\fR here as an example, you can use
any attribute name with a \f(CW\*(C`private_\*(C'\fR prefix.)
.PP
Taking that one step further, you can limit a particular \fIconnect_cached()\fR
call to return handles unique to that one place in the code by setting the
private attribute to a unique value for that place:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  DBI\->connect_cached(..., { private_foo_cachekey => _\|_FILE_\|_._\|_LINE_\|_, ... });
.Ve
.PP
By using a private attribute you still get connection caching for
the individual calls to \fIconnect_cached()\fR but, by making separate
database connections for separate parts of the code, the database
handles are isolated from any attribute changes made to other handles.
.PP
The cache can be accessed (and cleared) via the \*(L"CachedKids\*(R" attribute:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $CachedKids_hashref = $dbh\->{Driver}\->{CachedKids};
\&  %$CachedKids_hashref = () if $CachedKids_hashref;

Calls \fIavailable_drivers()\fR and attempts to load each of them in turn
using \fIinstall_driver()\fR.  For each load that succeeds the driver
name and version number are added to a hash. When running under
DBI::PurePerl drivers which appear not be pure-perl are ignored.
.PP
When called in array context the list of successfully loaded drivers
is returned (without the '\s-1DBD::\s0' prefix).
.PP
When called in scalar context an extra entry for the \f(CW\*(C`DBI\*(C'\fR is added (and
\&\f(CW\*(C`DBI::PurePerl\*(C'\fR if appropriate) and a reference to the hash is returned.

When called in a void context the \fIinstalled_versions()\fR method will
print out a formatted list of the hash contents, one per line, along with some
other information about the \s-1DBI\s0 version and \s-1OS.\s0
.PP
Due to the potentially high memory cost and unknown risks of loading
in an unknown number of drivers that just happen to be installed
on the system, this method is not recommended for general use.
Use \fIavailable_drivers()\fR instead.

The \fIinstalled_versions()\fR method is primarily intended as a quick

The initial \f(CW\*(C`UTF8\*(C'\fR on/off refers to Perl's internal SvUTF8 flag.
If \f(CW$string\fR has the SvUTF8 flag set but the sequence of bytes it

.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`ASCII\*(C'\fR vs \f(CW\*(C`non\-ASCII\*(C'\fR portion shows \f(CW\*(C`ASCII\*(C'\fR if \fIall\fR the

Returns an informal description of the first character difference

For example:

.Ve
.PP
Unicode characters are reported in \f(CW\*(C`\ex{XXXX}\*(C'\fR format. Unicode
code points in the range U+0800 to U+08FF are unassigned and most
likely to occur due to double-encoding. Characters in this range
are reported as \f(CW\*(C`\ex{08XX}=\*(AqC\*(Aq\*(C'\fR where \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR is the corresponding
latin\-1 character.

The \f(CW$type\fR parameter selects which kind of hash algorithm should be used.
.PP
For the technically curious, type 0 (which is the default if \f(CW$type\fR

.PP
Returns the \fInative\fR database engine error code from the last driver
method called. The code is typically an integer but you should not
assume that.
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 resets \f(CW$h\fR\->err to undef before almost all \s-1DBI\s0 method calls, so the
value only has a short lifespan. Also, for most drivers, the statement
handles share the same error variable as the parent database handle,
so calling a method on one handle may reset the error on the
related handles.
.PP
(Methods which don't reset err before being called include \fIerr()\fR and \fIerrstr()\fR,
obviously, \fIstate()\fR, \fIrows()\fR, \fIfunc()\fR, \fItrace()\fR, \fItrace_msg()\fR, \fIping()\fR, and the
tied hash attribute \s-1\fIFETCH\s0()\fR and \s-1\fISTORE\s0()\fR methods.)
.PP
If you need to test for specific error conditions \fIand\fR have your program be
portable to different database engines, then you'll need to determine what the
corresponding error codes are for all those engines and test for all of them.
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 uses the value of \f(CW$DBI::stderr\fR as the \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR value for internal errors.
Drivers should also do likewise.  The default value for \f(CW$DBI::stderr\fR is 2000000000.
.PP
A driver may return \f(CW0\fR from \fIerr()\fR to indicate a warning condition
after a method call. Similarly, a driver may return an empty string
to indicate a 'success with information' condition. In both these
cases the value is false but not undef. The \fIerrstr()\fR and \fIstate()\fR

The \fIerrstr()\fR method should not be used to test for errors, use \fIerr()\fR

Set the \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`errstr\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR values for the handle.
This method is typically only used by \s-1DBI\s0 drivers and \s-1DBI\s0 subclasses.
.PP
If the \*(L"HandleSetErr\*(R" attribute holds a reference to a subroutine
it is called first. The subroutine can alter the \f(CW$err\fR, \f(CW$errstr\fR, \f(CW$state\fR,
and \f(CW$method\fR values. See \*(L"HandleSetErr\*(R" for full details.
If the subroutine returns a true value then the handle \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`errstr\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR values are not altered and \fIset_err()\fR returns
an empty list (it normally returns \f(CW$rv\fR which defaults to undef, see below).
.PP
Setting \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR to a \fItrue\fR value indicates an error and will trigger
the normal \s-1DBI\s0 error handling mechanisms, such as \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`HandleError\*(C'\fR, if they are enabled, when execution returns from
the \s-1DBI\s0 back to the application.
.PP
Setting \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR to \f(CW""\fR indicates an 'information' state, and setting
it to \f(CW"0"\fR indicates a 'warning' state. Setting \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR
also sets \f(CW\*(C`errstr\*(C'\fR to undef, and \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR to \f(CW""\fR, irrespective
of the values of the \f(CW$errstr\fR and \f(CW$state\fR parameters.
.PP
The \f(CW$method\fR parameter provides an alternate method name for the
\&\f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`PrintWarn\*(C'\fR error string instead of
the fairly unhelpful '\f(CW\*(C`set_err\*(C'\fR'.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`set_err\*(C'\fR method normally returns undef.  The \f(CW$rv\fR parameter
provides an alternate return value.
.PP
Some special rules apply if the \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`errstr\*(C'\fR
values for the handle are \fIalready\fR set...
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`errstr\*(C'\fR is true then: "\f(CW\*(C` [err was %s now %s]\*(C'\fR" is appended if \f(CW$err\fR is
true and \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR is already true and the new err value differs from the original
one. Similarly "\f(CW\*(C` [state was %s now %s]\*(C'\fR" is appended if \f(CW$state\fR is true and \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR is
already true and the new state value differs from the original one. Finally
"\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR" and the new \f(CW$errstr\fR are appended if \f(CW$errstr\fR differs from the existing
errstr value. Obviously the \f(CW%s\fR's above are replaced by the corresponding values.
.PP
The handle \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR value is set to \f(CW$err\fR if: \f(CW$err\fR is true; or handle
\&\f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR value is undef; or \f(CW$err\fR is defined and the length is greater
than the handle \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR length. The effect is that an 'information'
state only overrides undef; a 'warning' overrides undef or 'information',
and an 'error' state overrides anything.
.PP
The handle \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR value is set to \f(CW$state\fR if \f(CW$state\fR is true and
the handle \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR value was set (by the rules above).

Brain transplants for handles. You don't need to know about this

A \s-1DBI\s0 handle is a reference to a tied hash. A tied hash has an
\&\fIinner\fR hash that actually holds the contents.  The \fIswap_inner_handle()\fR
method swaps the inner hashes between two handles. The \f(CW$h1\fR and \f(CW$h2\fR
handles still point to the same tied hashes, but what those hashes
are tied to has been swapped.  In effect \f(CW$h1\fR \fIbecomes\fR \f(CW$h2\fR and
vice-versa. This is powerful stuff, expect problems. Use with care.
.PP
As a small safety measure, the two handles, \f(CW$h1\fR and \f(CW$h2\fR, have to
share the same parent unless \f(CW$allow_reparent\fR is true.

These attributes are common to all types of \s-1DBI\s0 handles.
.PP
Some attributes are inherited by child handles. That is, the value
of an inherited attribute in a newly created statement handle is the
same as the value in the parent database handle. Changes to attributes
in the new statement handle do not affect the parent database handle
and changes to the database handle do not affect existing statement
handles, only future ones.

starting with a lowercase letter).

Type: boolean, inherited

The \f(CW\*(C`Warn\*(C'\fR attribute enables useful warnings for certain bad
practices. It is enabled by default and should only be disabled in
rare circumstances.  Since warnings are generated using the Perl
\&\f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR function, they can be intercepted using the Perl \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR

Type: boolean, read-only
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Active\*(C'\fR attribute is true if the handle object is \*(L"active\*(R". This is rarely used in
applications. The exact meaning of active is somewhat vague at the
moment. For a database handle it typically means that the handle is
connected to a database (\f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->disconnect\*(C'\fR sets \f(CW\*(C`Active\*(C'\fR off).  For
a statement handle it typically means that the handle is a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR
that may have more data to fetch. (Fetching all the data or calling \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->finish\*(C'\fR
sets \f(CW\*(C`Active\*(C'\fR off.)

Currently only the \f(CW$dbh\fR \fIdo()\fR method and the \f(CW$sth\fR \fIexecute()\fR, \fIexecute_array()\fR,
and \fIexecute_for_fetch()\fR methods set the \f(CW\*(C`Executed\*(C'\fR attribute.
.PP
When it's set on a handle it is also set on the parent handle at the
same time. So calling \fIexecute()\fR on a \f(CW$sth\fR also sets the \f(CW\*(C`Executed\*(C'\fR
attribute on the parent \f(CW$dbh\fR.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Executed\*(C'\fR attribute for a database handle is cleared by the \fIcommit()\fR and
\&\fIrollback()\fR methods (even if they fail). The \f(CW\*(C`Executed\*(C'\fR attribute of a
statement handle is not cleared by the \s-1DBI\s0 under any circumstances and so acts

.PP
It also has the effect of disabling the 'quick \s-1FETCH\s0' of attribute
values from the handles attribute cache. So all attribute values
are handled by the drivers own \s-1FETCH\s0 method. This makes them slightly
slower but is useful for special-purpose drivers like DBD::Multiplex.

.PP
Type: boolean
.PP
The default value, false, means a handle will be fully destroyed
as normal when the last reference to it is removed, just as you'd expect.
.PP
If set true then the handle will be treated by the \s-1DESTROY\s0 as if it was no
longer Active, and so the \fIdatabase engine\fR related effects of DESTROYing a
handle will be skipped.  Think of the name as meaning 'treat the handle as
not-Active in the \s-1DESTROY\s0 method'.
.PP
For a database handle, this attribute does not disable an \fIexplicit\fR
call to the disconnect method, only the implicit call from \s-1DESTROY\s0
that happens if the handle is still marked as \f(CW\*(C`Active\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This attribute is specifically designed for use in Unix applications
that \*(L"fork\*(R" child processes.  For some drivers, when the child process exits
the destruction of inherited handles cause the corresponding handles in the
parent process to cease working.
.PP
Either the parent or the child process, but not both, should set
\&\f(CW\*(C`InactiveDestroy\*(C'\fR true on all their shared handles. Alternatively the
\&\*(L"AutoInactiveDestroy\*(R" can be set in the parent on connect.
.PP
To help tracing applications using fork the process id is shown in
the trace log whenever a \s-1DBI\s0 or handle \fItrace()\fR method is called.
The process id also shown for \fIevery\fR method call if the \s-1DBI\s0 trace
level (not handle trace level) is set high enough to show the trace
from the \s-1DBI\s0's method dispatcher, e.g. >= 9.

The \*(L"InactiveDestroy\*(R" attribute, described above, needs to be explicitly set

Use \f(CW\*(C`AutoInactiveDestroy\*(C'\fR to get around this situation.
.PP
If set true, the \s-1DESTROY\s0 method will check the process id of the handle and, if
different from the current process id, it will set the \fIInactiveDestroy\fR attribute.

This is the example it's designed to deal with:

The \f(CW\*(C`PrintWarn\*(C'\fR attribute controls the printing of warnings recorded

handler or modules like CGI::Carp and CGI::ErrorWrap.

.IX Subsection "RaiseError"
.PP
Type: boolean, inherited
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR attribute can be used to force errors to raise exceptions rather
than simply return error codes in the normal way. It is \*(L"off\*(R" by default.
When set \*(L"on\*(R", any method which results in an error will cause
the \s-1DBI\s0 to effectively do a \f(CW\*(C`die("$class $method failed: $DBI::errstr")\*(C'\fR,
where \f(CW$class\fR is the driver class and \f(CW$method\fR is the name of the method
that failed. E.g.,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  DBD::Oracle::db prepare failed: ... error text here ...
.Ve
.PP
If you turn \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR on then you'd normally turn \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR off.
If \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR is also on, then the \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR is done first (naturally).
.PP
Typically \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR is used in conjunction with \f(CW\*(C`eval { ... }\*(C'\fR
to catch the exception that's been thrown and followed by an
\&\f(CW\*(C`if ($@) { ... }\*(C'\fR block to handle the caught exception.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  eval {
\&    ...
\&    $sth\->execute();
\&    ...
\&  };
\&  if ($@) {
\&    # $sth\->err and $DBI::err will be true if error was from DBI
\&    warn $@; # print the error
\&    ... # do whatever you need to deal with the error
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
In that eval block the \f(CW$DBI::lasth\fR variable can be useful for
diagnosis and reporting if you can't be sure which handle triggered
the error.  For example, \f(CW$DBI::lasth\fR\->{Type} and \f(CW$DBI::lasth\fR\->{Statement}.
.PP
See also \*(L"Transactions\*(R".
.PP
If you want to temporarily turn \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR off (inside a library function
that is likely to fail, for example), the recommended way is like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  {
\&    local $h\->{RaiseError};  # localize and turn off for this block
\&    ...
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
The original value will automatically and reliably be restored by Perl,
regardless of how the block is exited.
The same logic applies to other attributes, including \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`HandleError\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "HandleError"
.PP
Type: code ref, inherited
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`HandleError\*(C'\fR attribute can be used to provide your own alternative behaviour
in case of errors. If set to a reference to a subroutine then that
subroutine is called when an error is detected (at the same point that
\&\f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR are handled).
.PP
The subroutine is called with three parameters: the error message
string that \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR would use,
the \s-1DBI\s0 handle being used, and the first value being returned by
the method that failed (typically undef).
.PP
If the subroutine returns a false value then the \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR
and/or \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR attributes are checked and acted upon as normal.
.PP
For example, to \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR with a full stack trace for any error:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use Carp;
\&  $h\->{HandleError} = sub { confess(shift) };
.Ve
.PP
Or to turn errors into exceptions:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use Exception; # or your own favourite exception module
\&  $h\->{HandleError} = sub { Exception\->new(\*(AqDBI\*(Aq)\->raise($_[0]) };
.Ve
.PP
It is possible to 'stack' multiple HandleError handlers by using
closures:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  sub your_subroutine {
\&    my $previous_handler = $h\->{HandleError};
\&    $h\->{HandleError} = sub {
\&      return 1 if $previous_handler and &$previous_handler(@_);
\&      ... your code here ...
\&    };
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Using a \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR inside a subroutine to store the previous \f(CW\*(C`HandleError\*(C'\fR
value is important.  See perlsub and perlref for more information
about \fIclosures\fR.
.PP
It is possible for \f(CW\*(C`HandleError\*(C'\fR to alter the error message that
will be used by \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR if it returns false.
It can do that by altering the value of \f(CW$_\fR[0]. This example appends
a stack trace to all errors and, unlike the previous example using
Carp::confess, this will work \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR as well as \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $h\->{HandleError} = sub { $_[0]=Carp::longmess($_[0]); 0; };
.Ve
.PP
It is also possible for \f(CW\*(C`HandleError\*(C'\fR to hide an error, to a limited
degree, by using \*(L"set_err\*(R" to reset \f(CW$DBI::err\fR and \f(CW$DBI::errstr\fR,
and altering the return value of the failed method. For example:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  $h\->{HandleError} = sub {
\&    return 0 unless $_[0] =~ /^\eS+ fetchrow_arrayref failed:/;
\&    return 0 unless $_[1]\->err == 1234; # the error to \*(Aqhide\*(Aq
\&    $h\->set_err(undef,undef);   # turn off the error
\&    $_[2] = [ ... ];    # supply alternative return value
\&    return 1;
\&  };
.Ve
.PP
This only works for methods which return a single value and is hard
to make reliable (avoiding infinite loops, for example) and so isn't
recommended for general use!  If you find a \fIgood\fR use for it then
please let me know.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`HandleSetErr\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "HandleSetErr"
.PP
Type: code ref, inherited
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`HandleSetErr\*(C'\fR attribute can be used to intercept
the setting of handle \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`errstr\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR values.
If set to a reference to a subroutine then that subroutine is called
whenever \fIset_err()\fR is called, typically by the driver or a subclass.
.PP
The subroutine is called with five arguments, the first five that
were passed to \fIset_err()\fR: the handle, the \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`errstr\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR values being set, and the method name. These can be altered
by changing the values in the \f(CW@_\fR array. The return value affects
\&\fIset_err()\fR behaviour, see \*(L"set_err\*(R" for details.
.PP
It is possible to 'stack' multiple HandleSetErr handlers by using
closures. See \*(L"HandleError\*(R" for an example.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`HandleSetErr\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`HandleError\*(C'\fR subroutines differ in subtle
but significant ways. HandleError is only invoked at the point where
the \s-1DBI\s0 is about to return to the application with \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR set true.
It's not invoked by the failure of a method that's been called by
another \s-1DBI\s0 method.  HandleSetErr, on the other hand, is called
whenever \fIset_err()\fR is called with a defined \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR value, even if false.
So it's not just for errors, despite the name, but also warn and info states.
The \fIset_err()\fR method, and thus HandleSetErr, may be called multiple
times within a method and is usually invoked from deep within driver code.
.PP
In theory a driver can use the return value from HandleSetErr via
\&\fIset_err()\fR to decide whether to continue or not. If \fIset_err()\fR returns
an empty list, indicating that the HandleSetErr code has 'handled'
the 'error', the driver could then continue instead of failing (if
that's a reasonable thing to do).  This isn't excepted to be
common and any such cases should be clearly marked in the driver
documentation and discussed on the dbi-dev mailing list.

.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`ErrCount\*(C'\fR attribute was added in \s-1DBI 1.41.\s0 Older drivers may
not have been updated to use \fIset_err()\fR to record errors and so this

The \f(CW\*(C`ShowErrorStatement\*(C'\fR attribute can be used to cause the relevant
Statement text to be appended to the error messages generated by
the \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`PrintWarn\*(C'\fR attributes.
Only applies to errors on statement handles
plus the \fIprepare()\fR, \fIdo()\fR, and the various \f(CW\*(C`select*()\*(C'\fR database handle methods.
(The exact format of the appended text is subject to change.)
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`$h\->{ParamValues}\*(C'\fR returns a hash reference of parameter
(placeholder) values then those are formatted and appended to the
end of the Statement text in the error message.

Type: string, inherited
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`FetchHashKeyName\*(C'\fR attribute is used to specify whether the \fIfetchrow_hashref()\fR
method should perform case conversion on the field names used for
the hash keys. For historical reasons it defaults to '\f(CW\*(C`NAME\*(C'\fR' but
it is recommended to set it to '\f(CW\*(C`NAME_lc\*(C'\fR' (convert to lower case)
or '\f(CW\*(C`NAME_uc\*(C'\fR' (convert to upper case) according to your preference.
It can only be set for driver and database handles.  For statement
handles the value is frozen when \fIprepare()\fR is called.

The \f(CW\*(C`ChopBlanks\*(C'\fR attribute can be used to control the trimming of trailing space
characters from fixed width character (\s-1CHAR\s0) fields. No other field
types are affected, even where field values have trailing spaces.
.PP
The default is false (although it is possible that the default may change).
Applications that need specific behaviour should set the attribute as
needed.

Drivers are not required to support this attribute, but any driver which
does not support it must arrange to return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR as the attribute value.

.IX Subsection "LongReadLen"
.PP
Type: unsigned integer, inherited
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR attribute may be used to control the maximum
length of 'long' type fields (\s-1LONG, BLOB, CLOB, MEMO,\s0 etc.) which the driver will
read from the database automatically when it fetches each row of data.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR attribute only relates to fetching and reading
long values; it is not involved in inserting or updating them.
.PP
A value of 0 means not to automatically fetch any long data.
Drivers may return undef or an empty string for long fields when
\&\f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR is 0.
.PP
The default is typically 0 (zero) or 80 bytes but may vary between drivers.
Applications fetching long fields should set this value to slightly
larger than the longest long field value to be fetched.
.PP
Some databases return some long types encoded as pairs of hex digits.
For these types, \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR relates to the underlying data
length and not the doubled-up length of the encoded string.
.PP
Changing the value of \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR for a statement handle after it
has been \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR'd will typically have no effect, so it's common to
set \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR on the \f(CW$dbh\fR before calling \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For most drivers the value used here has a direct effect on the
memory used by the statement handle while it's active, so don't be
too generous. If you can't be sure what value to use you could
execute an extra select statement to determine the longest value.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  $dbh\->{LongReadLen} = $dbh\->selectrow_array(qq{
\&      SELECT MAX(OCTET_LENGTH(long_column_name))
\&      FROM table WHERE ...
\&  });
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(qq{
\&      SELECT long_column_name, ... FROM table WHERE ...
\&  });
.Ve
.PP
You may need to take extra care if the table can be modified between
the first select and the second being executed. You may also need to
use a different function if \s-1\fIOCTET_LENGTH\s0()\fR does not work for long
types in your database. For example, for Sybase use \s-1\fIDATALENGTH\s0()\fR and
for Oracle use \s-1\fILENGTHB\s0()\fR.

.IX Subsection "LongTruncOk"
.PP
Type: boolean, inherited
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`LongTruncOk\*(C'\fR attribute may be used to control the effect of
fetching a long field value which has been truncated (typically
because it's longer than the value of the \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR attribute).
.PP
By default, \f(CW\*(C`LongTruncOk\*(C'\fR is false and so fetching a long value that
needs to be truncated will cause the fetch to fail.
(Applications should always be sure to
check for errors after a fetch loop in case an error, such as a divide
by zero or long field truncation, caused the fetch to terminate
prematurely.)
.PP
If a fetch fails due to a long field truncation when \f(CW\*(C`LongTruncOk\*(C'\fR is
false, many drivers will allow you to continue fetching further rows.

Type: boolean, inherited

An application can set the \f(CW\*(C`ReadOnly\*(C'\fR attribute of a handle to a true value to
indicate that it will not be attempting to make any changes using that handle
or any children of it.
.PP
Note that the exact definition of 'read only' is rather fuzzy.
For more details see the documentation for the driver you're using.
.PP
If the driver can make the handle truly read-only then it should
(unless doing so would have unpleasant side effect, like changing the
consistency level from per-statement to per-session).
Otherwise the attribute is simply advisory.
.PP
A driver can set the \f(CW\*(C`ReadOnly\*(C'\fR attribute itself to indicate that the data it
is connected to cannot be changed for some reason.
.PP
If the driver cannot ensure the \f(CW\*(C`ReadOnly\*(C'\fR attribute is adhered to it
will record a warning.  In this case reading the \f(CW\*(C`ReadOnly\*(C'\fR attribute
back after it is set true will return true even if the underlying
driver cannot ensure this (so any application knows the application
declared itself ReadOnly).
.PP
Library modules and proxy drivers can use the attribute to influence
their behavior.  For example, the DBD::Gofer driver considers the
\&\f(CW\*(C`ReadOnly\*(C'\fR attribute when making a decision about whether to retry an
operation that failed.

The attribute should be set to 1 or 0 (or undef). Other values are reserved.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`Callbacks\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Callbacks"
.PP
Type: hash ref
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 callback mechanism lets you intercept, and optionally replace, any
method call on a \s-1DBI\s0 handle. At the extreme, it lets you become a puppet
master, deceiving the application in any way you want.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Callbacks\*(C'\fR attribute is a hash reference where the keys are \s-1DBI\s0 method
names and the values are code references. For each key naming a method, the
\&\s-1DBI\s0 will execute the associated code reference before executing the method.
.PP
The arguments to the code reference will be the same as to the method,
including the invocant (a database handle or statement handle). For example,
say that to callback to some code on a call to \f(CW\*(C`prepare()\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  $dbh\->{Callbacks} = {
\&      prepare => sub {
\&          my ($dbh, $query, $attrs) = @_;
\&          print "Preparing q{$query}\en"
\&      },
\&  };
.Ve
.PP
The callback would then be executed when you called the \f(CW\*(C`prepare()\*(C'\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->prepare(\*(AqSELECT 1\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
And the output of course would be:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  Preparing q{SELECT 1}
.Ve
.PP
Because callbacks are executed \fIbefore\fR the methods
they're associated with, you can modify the arguments before they're passed on
to the method call. For example, to make sure that all calls to \f(CW\*(C`prepare()\*(C'\fR
are immediately prepared by DBD::Pg, add a callback that makes sure that
the \f(CW\*(C`pg_prepare_now\*(C'\fR attribute is always set:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&  my $dbh = DBI\->connect($dsn, $username, $auth, {
\&      Callbacks => {
\&          prepare => sub {
\&              $_[2] ||= {};
\&              $_[2]\->{pg_prepare_now} = 1;
\&              return; # must return nothing
\&          },
\&      }
\&  });
.Ve
.PP
Note that we are editing the contents of \f(CW@_\fR directly. In this case we've
created the attributes hash if it's not passed to the \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR call.
.PP
You can also prevent the associated method from ever executing. While a
callback executes, \f(CW$_\fR holds the method name. (This allows multiple callbacks
to share the same code reference and still know what method was called.)
To prevent the method from
executing, simply \f(CW\*(C`undef $_\*(C'\fR. For example, if you wanted to disable calls to
\&\f(CW\*(C`ping()\*(C'\fR, you could do this:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  $dbh\->{Callbacks} = {
\&      ping => sub {
\&          # tell dispatch to not call the method:
\&          undef $_;
\&          # return this value instead:
\&          return "42 bells";
\&      }
\&  };
.Ve
.PP
As with other attributes, Callbacks can be specified on a handle or via the
attributes to \f(CW\*(C`connect()\*(C'\fR. Callbacks can also be applied to a statement
methods on a statement handle. For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  $sth\->{Callbacks} = {
\&      execute => sub {
\&          print "Executing ", shift\->{Statement}, "\en";
\&      }
\&  };
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Callbacks\*(C'\fR attribute of a database handle isn't copied to any statement
handles it creates. So setting callbacks for a statement handle requires you to
set the \f(CW\*(C`Callbacks\*(C'\fR attribute on the statement handle yourself, as in the
example above, or use the special \f(CW\*(C`ChildCallbacks\*(C'\fR key described below.
.PP
\&\fBSpecial Keys in Callbacks Attribute\fR
.PP
In addition to \s-1DBI\s0 handle method names, the \f(CW\*(C`Callbacks\*(C'\fR hash reference
supports four additional keys.
.PP
The first is the \f(CW\*(C`ChildCallbacks\*(C'\fR key. When a statement handle is created from
a database handle the \f(CW\*(C`ChildCallbacks\*(C'\fR key of the database handle's
\&\f(CW\*(C`Callbacks\*(C'\fR attribute, if any, becomes the new \f(CW\*(C`Callbacks\*(C'\fR attribute of the
statement handle.
This allows you to define callbacks for all statement handles created from a
database handle. For example, if you wanted to count how many times \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR
was called in your application, you could write:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  my $exec_count = 0;
\&  my $dbh = DBI\->connect( $dsn, $username, $auth, {
\&      Callbacks => {
\&          ChildCallbacks => {
\&              execute => sub { $exec_count++; return; }
\&          }
\&      }
\&  });
\&
\&  END {
\&      print "The execute method was called $exec_count times\en";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
The other three special keys are \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached.new\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`connect_cached.connected\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached.reused\*(C'\fR. These keys define
callbacks that are called when \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached()\*(C'\fR is called, but allow
different behaviors depending on whether a new handle is created or a handle
is returned. The callback is invoked with these arguments:
\&\f(CW\*(C`$dbh, $dsn, $user, $auth, $attr\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For example, some applications uses \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached()\*(C'\fR to connect with
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR enabled and then disable \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR temporarily for
transactions. If \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached()\*(C'\fR is called during a transaction, perhaps in
a utility method, then it might select the same cached handle and then force
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR on, forcing a commit of the transaction. See the \*(L"connect_cached\*(R"
documentation for one way to deal with that. Here we'll describe an alternative
approach using a callback.
.PP
Because the \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached.new\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached.reused\*(C'\fR callbacks are
invoked before \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached()\*(C'\fR has applied the connect attributes, you can
use them to edit the attributes that will be applied. To prevent a cached
handle from having its transactions committed before it's returned, you can
eliminate the \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR attribute in a \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached.reused\*(C'\fR callback,
like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my $cb = {
\&      \*(Aqconnect_cached.reused\*(Aq => sub { delete $_[4]\->{AutoCommit} },
\&  };
\&
\&  sub dbh {
\&      my $self = shift;
\&      DBI\->connect_cached( $dsn, $username, $auth, {
\&          PrintError => 0,
\&          RaiseError => 1,
\&          AutoCommit => 1,
\&          Callbacks  => $cb,
\&      });
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
The upshot is that new database handles are created with \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR
enabled, while cached database handles are left in whatever transaction state
they happened to be in when retrieved from the cache.
.PP
Note that we've also used a lexical for the callbacks hash reference. This is
because \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached()\*(C'\fR returns a new database handle if any of the
attributes passed to is have changed. If we used an inline hash reference,
\&\f(CW\*(C`connect_cached()\*(C'\fR would return a new database handle every time. Which would
rather defeat the purpose.
.PP
A more common application for callbacks is setting connection state only when
a new connection is made (by \fIconnect()\fR or \fIconnect_cached()\fR). Adding a callback
to the connected method (when using \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR) or via
\&\f(CW\*(C`connect_cached.connected\*(C'\fR (when useing \fIconnect_cached()\fR>) makes this easy.
The \fIconnected()\fR method is a no-op by default (unless you subclass the \s-1DBI\s0 and
change it). The \s-1DBI\s0 calls it to indicate that a new connection has been made
and the connection attributes have all been set. You can give it a bit of
added functionality by applying a callback to it. For example, to make sure
that MySQL understands your application's ANSI-compliant \s-1SQL,\s0 set it up like
so:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  my $dbh = DBI\->connect($dsn, $username, $auth, {
\&      Callbacks => {
\&          connected => sub {
\&              shift\->do(q{
\&                  SET SESSION sql_mode=\*(Aqansi,strict_trans_tables,no_auto_value_on_zero\*(Aq;
\&              });
\&              return;
\&          },
\&      }
\&  });
.Ve
.PP
If you're using \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached()\*(C'\fR, use the \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached.connected\*(C'\fR
callback, instead. This is because \f(CW\*(C`connected()\*(C'\fR is called for both new and
reused database handles, but you want to execute a callback only the when a
new database handle is returned. For example, to set the time zone on
connection to a PostgreSQL database, try this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  my $cb = {
\&      \*(Aqconnect_cached.connected\*(Aq => sub {
\&          shift\->do(\*(AqSET timezone = UTC\*(Aq);
\&      }
\&  };
\&
\&  sub dbh {
\&      my $self = shift;
\&      DBI\->connect_cached( $dsn, $username, $auth, { Callbacks => $cb });
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
One significant limitation with callbacks is that there can only be one per
method per handle. This means it's easy for one use of callbacks to interfere
with, or typically simply overwrite, another use of callbacks. For this reason
modules using callbacks should document the fact clearly so application authors
can tell if use of callbacks by the module will clash with use of callbacks by
the application.
.PP
You might be able to work around this issue by taking a copy of the original
callback and calling it within your own. For example:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  my $prev_cb = $h\->{Callbacks}{method_name};
\&  $h\->{Callbacks}{method_name} = sub {
\&    if ($prev_cb) {
\&        my @result = $prev_cb\->(@_);
\&        return @result if not $_; # $prev_cb vetoed call
\&    }
\&    ... your callback logic here ...
\&  };

The \s-1DBI\s0 provides a way to store extra information in a \s-1DBI\s0 handle as
\&\*(L"private\*(R" attributes. The \s-1DBI\s0 will allow you to store and retrieve any
attribute which has a name starting with "\f(CW\*(C`private_\*(C'\fR".
.PP
It is \fIstrongly\fR recommended that you use just \fIone\fR private
attribute (e.g., use a hash ref) \fIand\fR give it a long and unambiguous
name that includes the module or application name that the attribute
relates to (e.g., "\f(CW\*(C`private_YourFullModuleName_thingy\*(C'\fR").
.PP
Because of the way the Perl tie mechanism works you cannot reliably
use the \f(CW\*(C`||=\*(C'\fR operator directly to initialise the attribute, like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $foo = $dbh\->{private_yourmodname_foo} ||= { ... }; # WRONG
.Ve
.PP
you should use a two step approach like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $foo = $dbh\->{private_yourmodname_foo};
\&  $foo ||= $dbh\->{private_yourmodname_foo} = { ... };
.Ve

This attribute is primarily of interest to people sub-classing \s-1DBI,\s0
or for applications to piggy-back extra information onto \s-1DBI\s0 handles.
.SH "DBI DATABASE HANDLE OBJECTS"
.IX Header "DBI DATABASE HANDLE OBJECTS"
This section covers the methods and attributes associated with
database handles.
.SS "Database Handle Methods"
.IX Subsection "Database Handle Methods"
The following methods are specified for \s-1DBI\s0 database handles:
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`clone\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "clone"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $new_dbh = $dbh\->clone(\e%attr);
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`clone\*(C'\fR method duplicates the \f(CW$dbh\fR connection by connecting
with the same parameters ($dsn, \f(CW$user\fR, \f(CW$password\fR) as originally used.
.PP
The attributes for the cloned connect are the same as those used
for the \fIoriginal\fR connect, with any other attributes in \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR
merged over them.  Effectively the same as doing:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  %attributes_used = ( %original_attributes, %attr );
.Ve
.PP
If \e%attr is not given then it defaults to a hash containing all
the attributes in the attribute cache of \f(CW$dbh\fR excluding any non-code
references, plus the main boolean attributes (RaiseError, PrintError,
AutoCommit, etc.). \fIThis behaviour is unreliable and so use of clone without
an argument is deprecated and may cause a warning in a future release.\fR
.PP
The clone method can be used even if the database handle is disconnected.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`clone\*(C'\fR method was added in \s-1DBI 1.33.\s0
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`data_sources\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "data_sources"
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  @ary = $dbh\->data_sources();
\&  @ary = $dbh\->data_sources(\e%attr);
.Ve
.PP
Returns a list of data sources (databases) available via the \f(CW$dbh\fR
driver's \fIdata_sources()\fR method, plus any extra data sources that
the driver can discover via the connected \f(CW$dbh\fR. Typically the extra
data sources are other databases managed by the same server process
that the \f(CW$dbh\fR is connected to.
.PP
Data sources are returned in a form suitable for passing to the
\&\*(L"connect\*(R" method (that is, they will include the "\f(CW\*(C`dbi:$driver:\*(C'\fR" prefix).
.PP
The \fIdata_sources()\fR method, for a \f(CW$dbh\fR, was added in \s-1DBI 1.38.\s0
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`do\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "do"
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $rows = $dbh\->do($statement)           or die $dbh\->errstr;
\&  $rows = $dbh\->do($statement, \e%attr)   or die $dbh\->errstr;
\&  $rows = $dbh\->do($statement, \e%attr, @bind_values) or die ...
.Ve
.PP
Prepare and execute a single statement. Returns the number of rows
affected or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on error. A return value of \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR means the
number of rows is not known, not applicable, or not available.
.PP
This method is typically most useful for \fInon\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements that
either cannot be prepared in advance (due to a limitation of the
driver) or do not need to be executed repeatedly. It should not
be used for \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements because it does not return a statement
handle (so you can't fetch any data).
.PP
The default \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR method is logically similar to:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  sub do {
\&      my($dbh, $statement, $attr, @bind_values) = @_;
\&      my $sth = $dbh\->prepare($statement, $attr) or return undef;
\&      $sth\->execute(@bind_values) or return undef;
\&      my $rows = $sth\->rows;
\&      ($rows == 0) ? "0E0" : $rows; # always return true if no error
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  my $rows_deleted = $dbh\->do(q{
\&      DELETE FROM table
\&      WHERE status = ?
\&  }, undef, \*(AqDONE\*(Aq) or die $dbh\->errstr;
.Ve
.PP
Using placeholders and \f(CW@bind_values\fR with the \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR method can be
useful because it avoids the need to correctly quote any variables
in the \f(CW$statement\fR. But if you'll be executing the statement many
times then it's more efficient to \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR it once and call
\&\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR many times instead.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`q{...}\*(C'\fR style quoting used in this example avoids clashing with
quotes that may be used in the \s-1SQL\s0 statement. Use the double-quote-like
\&\f(CW\*(C`qq{...}\*(C'\fR operator if you want to interpolate variables into the string.
See \*(L"Quote and Quote-like Operators\*(R" in perlop for more details.
.PP
Note drivers are free to avoid the overhead of creating an \s-1DBI\s0
statement handle for \fIdo()\fR, especially if there are no parameters. In
this case error handlers, if invoked during \fIdo()\fR, will be passed the
database handle.

\&  $rv = $dbh\->last_insert_id($catalog, $schema, $table, $field);
\&  $rv = $dbh\->last_insert_id($catalog, $schema, $table, $field, \e%attr);
.Ve
.PP
Returns a value 'identifying' the row just inserted, if possible.
Typically this would be a value assigned by the database server
to a column with an \fIauto_increment\fR or \fIserial\fR type.
Returns undef if the driver does not support the method or can't
determine the value.
.PP
The \f(CW$catalog\fR, \f(CW$schema\fR, \f(CW$table\fR, and \f(CW$field\fR parameters may be required
for some drivers (see below).  If you don't know the parameter values
and your driver does not need them, then use \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR for each.
.PP
There are several caveats to be aware of with this method if you want
to use it for portable applications:
.PP
\&\fB*\fR For some drivers the value may only available immediately after
the insert statement has executed (e.g., mysql, Informix).
.PP
\&\fB*\fR For some drivers the \f(CW$catalog\fR, \f(CW$schema\fR, \f(CW$table\fR, and \f(CW$field\fR parameters
are required, for others they are ignored (e.g., mysql).
.PP
\&\fB*\fR Drivers may return an indeterminate value if no insert has
been performed yet.
.PP
\&\fB*\fR For some drivers the value may only be available if placeholders
have \fInot\fR been used (e.g., Sybase, \s-1MS SQL\s0). In this case the value
returned would be from the last non-placeholder insert statement.
.PP
\&\fB*\fR Some drivers may need driver-specific hints about how to get
the value. For example, being told the name of the database 'sequence'
object that holds the value. Any such hints are passed as driver-specific
attributes in the \e%attr parameter.
.PP
\&\fB*\fR If the underlying database offers nothing better, then some
drivers may attempt to implement this method by executing
"\f(CW\*(C`select max($field) from $table\*(C'\fR". Drivers using any approach
like this should issue a warning if \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is true because
it is generally unsafe \- another process may have modified the table
between your insert and the select. For situations where you know
it is safe, such as when you have locked the table, you can silence
the warning by passing \f(CW\*(C`Warn\*(C'\fR => 0 in \e%attr.
.PP
\&\fB*\fR If no insert has been performed yet, or the last insert failed,
then the value is implementation defined.
.PP
Given all the caveats above, it's clear that this method must be
used with care.
.PP

This utility method combines \*(L"prepare\*(R", \*(L"execute\*(R" and
\&\*(L"fetchrow_array\*(R" into a single call. If called in a list context, it
returns the first row of data from the statement.  The \f(CW$statement\fR
parameter can be a previously prepared statement handle, in which case
the \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR is skipped.
.PP
If any method fails, and \*(L"RaiseError\*(R" is not set, \f(CW\*(C`selectrow_array\*(C'\fR
will return an empty list.
.PP
If called in a scalar context for a statement handle that has more
than one column, it is undefined whether the driver will return
the value of the first column or the last. So don't do that.
Also, in a scalar context, an \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned if there are no
more rows or if an error occurred. That \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR can't be distinguished
from an \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR returned because the first field value was \s-1NULL.\s0
For these reasons you should exercise some caution if you use

statement will typically just store the statement in the returned
handle and process it when \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->execute\*(C'\fR is called. Such drivers are
unlikely to give much useful information about the
statement, such as \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->{NUM_OF_FIELDS}\*(C'\fR, until after \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->execute\*(C'\fR
has been called. Portable applications should take this into account.
.PP
In general, \s-1DBI\s0 drivers do not parse the contents of the statement
(other than simply counting any \*(L"Placeholders\*(R"). The statement is
passed directly to the database engine, sometimes known as pass-thru
mode. This has advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, you can
access all the functionality of the engine being used. On the downside,
you're limited if you're using a simple engine, and you need to take extra care if
writing applications intended to be portable between engines.
.PP
Portable applications should not assume that a new statement can be
prepared and/or executed while still fetching results from a previous
statement.
.PP
Some command-line \s-1SQL\s0 tools use statement terminators, like a semicolon,
to indicate the end of a statement. Such terminators should not normally
be used with the \s-1DBI.\s0

Here are some examples of \f(CW\*(C`prepare_cached\*(C'\fR:
.PP

\&  }
.Ve
.PP
\&\fICaveat emptor:\fR This caching can be useful in some applications,
but it can also cause problems and should be used with care. Here
is a contrived case where caching would cause a significant problem:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my $sth = $dbh\->prepare_cached(\*(AqSELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar=?\*(Aq);
\&  $sth\->execute(...);
\&  while (my $data = $sth\->fetchrow_hashref) {
\&
\&    # later, in some other code called within the loop...
\&    my $sth2 = $dbh\->prepare_cached(\*(AqSELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar=?\*(Aq);
\&    $sth2\->execute(...);
\&    while (my $data2 = $sth2\->fetchrow_arrayref) {
\&      do_stuff(...);
\&    }
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
In this example, since both handles are preparing the exact same statement,
\&\f(CW$sth2\fR will not be its own statement handle, but a duplicate of \f(CW$sth\fR
returned from the cache. The results will certainly not be what you expect.
Typically the inner fetch loop will work normally, fetching all
the records and terminating when there are no more, but now that \f(CW$sth\fR
is the same as \f(CW$sth2\fR the outer fetch loop will also terminate.
.PP
You'll know if you run into this problem because \fIprepare_cached()\fR
will generate a warning by default (when \f(CW$if_active\fR is false).
.PP
The cache used by \fIprepare_cached()\fR is keyed by both the statement
and any attributes so you can also avoid this issue by doing something
like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare_cached("...", { dbi_dummy => _\|_FILE_\|_._\|_LINE_\|_ });
.Ve
.PP
which will ensure that prepare_cached only returns statements cached
by that line of code in that source file.
.PP
If you'd like the cache to managed intelligently, you can tie the
hashref returned by \f(CW\*(C`CachedKids\*(C'\fR to an appropriate caching module,
such as Tie::Cache::LRU:
.PP

.Ve
.PP
Disconnects the database from the database handle. \f(CW\*(C`disconnect\*(C'\fR is typically only used
before exiting the program. The handle is of little use after disconnecting.
.PP
The transaction behaviour of the \f(CW\*(C`disconnect\*(C'\fR method is, sadly,
undefined.  Some database systems (such as Oracle and Ingres) will
automatically commit any outstanding changes, but others (such as
Informix) will rollback any outstanding changes.  Applications not
using \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR should explicitly call \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR before
calling \f(CW\*(C`disconnect\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The database is automatically disconnected by the \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR method if
still connected when there are no longer any references to the handle.
The \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR method for each driver should implicitly call \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR to
undo any uncommitted changes. This is vital behaviour to ensure that
incomplete transactions don't get committed simply because Perl calls
\&\f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR on every object before exiting. Also, do not rely on the order
of object destruction during \*(L"global destruction\*(R", as it is undefined.
.PP
Generally, if you want your changes to be committed or rolled back when
you disconnect, then you should explicitly call \*(L"commit\*(R" or \*(L"rollback\*(R"
before disconnecting.
.PP
If you disconnect from a database while you still have active
statement handles (e.g., \s-1SELECT\s0 statement handles that may have
more data to fetch), you will get a warning. The warning may indicate
that a fetch loop terminated early, perhaps due to an uncaught error.
To avoid the warning call the \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR method on the active handles.

The current \fIdefault\fR implementation always returns true without
actually doing anything. Actually, it returns "\f(CW\*(C`0 but true\*(C'\fR" which is
true but zero. That way you can tell if the return value is genuine or
just the default. Drivers should override this method with one that

.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"Standards Reference Information\*(R" for more detailed information
about the information types and their meanings and possible return values.
.PP
The DBI::Const::GetInfoType module exports a \f(CW%GetInfoType\fR hash that
can be used to map info type names to numbers. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $database_version = $dbh\->get_info( $GetInfoType{SQL_DBMS_VER} );

according to the database/driver, for example: \f(CW$table\fR = '%FOO%';
Remember that the underscore character ('\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR') is a search pattern

The identifier that is used to qualify the index name when doing a
\&\f(CW\*(C`DROP INDEX\*(C'\fR; \s-1NULL \s0(\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR) is returned if an index qualifier is not
supported by the data source.
If a non-NULL (defined) value is returned in this column, it must be used
to qualify the index name on a \f(CW\*(C`DROP INDEX\*(C'\fR statement; otherwise,
the \s-1TABLE_SCHEM\s0 should be used to qualify the index name.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1INDEX_NAME\s0\fR: The index identifier.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1TYPE\s0\fR: The type of information being returned.  Can be any of the
following values: 'table', 'btree', 'clustered', 'content', 'hashed',
or 'other'.
.PP
In the case that this field is 'table', all fields
other than \s-1TABLE_CAT, TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME, TYPE,

not supported for this index.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1CARDINALITY\s0\fR: Cardinality of the table or index.
For indexes, this is the number of unique values in the index.
For tables, this is the number of rows in the table.
If not supported, the value will be \s-1NULL \s0(\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR).
.PP
\&\fB\s-1PAGES\s0\fR: Number of storage pages used by this table or index.
If not supported, the value will be \s-1NULL \s0(\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR).
.PP
\&\fB\s-1FILTER_CONDITION\s0\fR: The index filter condition as a string.
If the index is not a filtered index, or it cannot be determined
whether the index is a filtered index, this value is \s-1NULL \s0(\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR).
If the index is a filtered index, but the filter condition
cannot be determined, this value is the empty string \f(CW\*(Aq\*(Aq\fR.

More than one row may have the same value in the \f(CW\*(C`DATA_TYPE\*(C'\fR

.PP
The rows are ordered by \f(CW\*(C`DATA_TYPE\*(C'\fR first and then by how closely each
type maps to the corresponding \s-1ODBC SQL\s0 data type, closest first.
.PP
The meaning of the fields is described in the documentation for
the \*(L"type_info\*(R" method.
.PP
An 'index' hash is provided so you don't need to rely on index
values defined above.  However, using \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 with some old \s-1ODBC\s0
drivers may return older names, shown as comments in the example above.
Another issue with the index hash is that the lettercase of the
keys is not defined. It is usually uppercase, as show here, but
drivers may return names with any lettercase.
.PP
Drivers are also free to return extra driver-specific columns of
information \- though it's recommended that they start at column
index 50 to leave room for expansion of the \s-1DBI/ODBC\s0 specification.

field above is \f(CW\*(C`SQL_INTERVAL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`SQL_DATETIME\*(C'\fR, this field will
hold the \fIsubcode\fR for the specific interval or datetime data type.
Otherwise it will be \s-1NULL \s0(\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
Although not mentioned explicitly in the standards, it seems there
is a simple relationship between these values:
.Sp

\&  DATA_TYPE == (10 * SQL_DATA_TYPE) + SQL_DATETIME_SUB
.Ve
.IP "\s-1NUM_PREC_RADIX \s0(integer)" 4
.IX Item "NUM_PREC_RADIX (integer)"
The radix value of the data type. For approximate numeric types,
\&\f(CW\*(C`NUM_PREC_RADIX\*(C'\fR
contains the value 2 and \f(CW\*(C`COLUMN_SIZE\*(C'\fR holds the number of bits. For
exact numeric types, \f(CW\*(C`NUM_PREC_RADIX\*(C'\fR contains the value 10 and \f(CW\*(C`COLUMN_SIZE\*(C'\fR holds
the number of decimal digits. \s-1NULL \s0(\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR) is returned either for data types
for which this is not applicable or if the driver cannot report this information.
.IP "\s-1INTERVAL_PRECISION \s0(integer)" 4
.IX Item "INTERVAL_PRECISION (integer)"
The interval leading precision for interval types. \s-1NULL\s0 is returned
either for data types for which this is not applicable or if the driver
cannot report this information.
.PP
For example, to find the type name for the fields in a select statement
you can do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @names = map { scalar $dbh\->type_info($_)\->{TYPE_NAME} } @{ $sth\->{TYPE} }
.Ve
.PP
Since \s-1DBI\s0 and \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers vary in how they map their types into the
\&\s-1ISO\s0 standard types you may need to search for more than one type.
Here's an example looking for a usable type to store a date:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $my_date_type = $dbh\->type_info( [ SQL_DATE, SQL_TIMESTAMP ] );
.Ve
.PP
Similarly, to more reliably find a type to store small integers, you could
use a list starting with \f(CW\*(C`SQL_SMALLINT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`SQL_INTEGER\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`SQL_DECIMAL\*(C'\fR, etc.

.IX Subsection "quote"
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $sql = $dbh\->quote($value);

.Ve
.PP
Quote a string literal for use as a literal value in an \s-1SQL\s0 statement,
by escaping any special characters (such as quotation marks)
contained within the string and adding the required type of outer
quotation marks.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $sql = sprintf "SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz = %s",
\&                $dbh\->quote("Don\*(Aqt");
.Ve
.PP
For most database types, at least those that conform to \s-1SQL\s0 standards, quote
would return \f(CW\*(AqDon\*(Aq\*(Aqt\*(Aq\fR (including the outer quotation marks). For others it
may return something like \f(CW\*(AqDon\e\*(Aqt\*(Aq\fR
.PP
An undefined \f(CW$value\fR value will be returned as the string \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR (without
single quotation marks) to match how NULLs are represented in \s-1SQL.\s0
.PP
If \f(CW$data_type\fR is supplied, it is used to try to determine the required
quoting behaviour by using the information returned by \*(L"type_info\*(R".
As a special case, the standard numeric types are optimized to return
\&\f(CW$value\fR without calling \f(CW\*(C`type_info\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Quote will probably \fInot\fR be able to deal with all possible input
(such as binary data or data containing newlines), and is not related in
any way with escaping or quoting shell meta-characters.
.PP
It is valid for the \fIquote()\fR method to return an \s-1SQL\s0 expression that
evaluates to the desired string. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $quoted = $dbh\->quote("one\entwo\e0three")
.Ve
.PP
may return something like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  CONCAT(\*(Aqone\*(Aq, CHAR(12), \*(Aqtwo\*(Aq, CHAR(0), \*(Aqthree\*(Aq)

.Ve
.PP
Quote an identifier (table name etc.) for use in an \s-1SQL\s0 statement,
by escaping any special characters (such as double quotation marks)
it contains and adding the required type of outer quotation marks.
.PP
Undefined names are ignored and the remainder are quoted and then
joined together, typically with a dot (\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR) character. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $id = $dbh\->quote_identifier( undef, \*(AqHer schema\*(Aq, \*(AqMy table\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
would, for most database types, return \f(CW"Her schema"."My table"\fR
(including all the double quotation marks).
.PP
If three names are supplied then the first is assumed to be a
catalog name and special rules may be applied based on what \*(L"get_info\*(R"
returns for \s-1SQL_CATALOG_NAME_SEPARATOR \s0(41) and \s-1SQL_CATALOG_LOCATION \s0(114).
For example, for Oracle:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $id = $dbh\->quote_identifier( \*(Aqlink\*(Aq, \*(Aqschema\*(Aq, \*(Aqtable\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
would return \f(CW"schema"."table"@"link"\fR.

.Ve
.PP
Leaves the \f(CW$dbh\fR in an almost dead, zombie-like, state and returns
a binary string of raw implementation data from the driver which
describes the current database connection. Effectively it detaches
the underlying database \s-1API\s0 connection data from the \s-1DBI\s0 handle.
After calling \fItake_imp_data()\fR, all other methods except \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR
will generate a warning and return undef.
.PP
Why would you want to do this? You don't, forget I even mentioned it.
Unless, that is, you're implementing something advanced like a
multi-threaded connection pool. See DBI::Pool.
.PP
The returned \f(CW$imp_data\fR can be passed as a \f(CW\*(C`dbi_imp_data\*(C'\fR attribute
to a later \fIconnect()\fR call, even in a separate thread in the same
process, where the driver can use it to 'adopt' the existing
connection that the implementation data was taken from.
.PP
Some things to keep in mind...
.PP
\&\fB*\fR the \f(CW$imp_data\fR holds the only reference to the underlying
database \s-1API\s0 connection data. That connection is still 'live' and
won't be cleaned up properly unless the \f(CW$imp_data\fR is used to create
a new \f(CW$dbh\fR which is then allowed to \fIdisconnect()\fR normally.
.PP
\&\fB*\fR using the same \f(CW$imp_data\fR to create more than one other new
\&\f(CW$dbh\fR at a time may well lead to unpleasant problems. Don't do that.
.PP
Any child statement handles are effectively destroyed when \fItake_imp_data()\fR is
called.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`take_imp_data\*(C'\fR method was added in \s-1DBI 1.36\s0 but wasn't useful till 1.49.
.SS "Database Handle Attributes"
.IX Subsection "Database Handle Attributes"
This section describes attributes specific to database handles.
.PP
Changes to these database handle attributes do not affect any other
existing or future database handles.
.PP
Attempting to set or get the value of an unknown attribute generates a warning,
except for private driver-specific attributes (which all have names
starting with a lowercase letter).
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $h\->{AutoCommit} = ...;       # set/write
\&  ... = $h\->{AutoCommit};       # get/read
.Ve
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "AutoCommit"
.PP
Type: boolean
.PP
If true, then database changes cannot be rolled-back (undone).  If false,
then database changes automatically occur within a \*(L"transaction\*(R", which
must either be committed or rolled back using the \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR
methods.
.PP
Drivers should always default to \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR mode (an unfortunate
choice largely forced on the \s-1DBI\s0 by \s-1ODBC\s0 and \s-1JDBC\s0 conventions.)
.PP
Attempting to set \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR to an unsupported value is a fatal error.
This is an important feature of the \s-1DBI.\s0 Applications that need
full transaction behaviour can set \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->{AutoCommit} = 0\*(C'\fR (or
set \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR to 0 via \*(L"connect\*(R")
without having to check that the value was assigned successfully.
.PP
For the purposes of this description, we can divide databases into three
categories:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  Databases which don\*(Aqt support transactions at all.
\&  Databases in which a transaction is always active.
\&  Databases in which a transaction must be explicitly started (C<\*(AqBEGIN WORK\*(Aq>).
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB* Databases which don't support transactions at all\fR
.PP
For these databases, attempting to turn \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR off is a fatal error.
\&\f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR both issue warnings about being ineffective while
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is in effect.
.PP
\&\fB* Databases in which a transaction is always active\fR
.PP
These are typically mainstream commercial relational databases with
\&\*(L"\s-1ANSI\s0 standard\*(R" transaction behaviour.
If \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is off, then changes to the database won't have any
lasting effect unless \*(L"commit\*(R" is called (but see also
\&\*(L"disconnect\*(R"). If \*(L"rollback\*(R" is called then any changes since the
last commit are undone.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is on, then the effect is the same as if the \s-1DBI\s0
called \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR automatically after every successful database
operation. So calling \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR explicitly while
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is on would be ineffective because the changes would
have already been committed.
.PP
Changing \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR from off to on will trigger a \*(L"commit\*(R".
.PP
For databases which don't support a specific auto-commit mode, the
driver has to commit each statement automatically using an explicit
\&\f(CW\*(C`COMMIT\*(C'\fR after it completes successfully (and roll it back using an
explicit \f(CW\*(C`ROLLBACK\*(C'\fR if it fails).  The error information reported to the
application will correspond to the statement which was executed, unless
it succeeded and the commit or rollback failed.
.PP
\&\fB* Databases in which a transaction must be explicitly started\fR
.PP
For these databases, the intention is to have them act like databases in
which a transaction is always active (as described above).
.PP
To do this, the driver will automatically begin an explicit transaction
when \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is turned off, or after a \*(L"commit\*(R" or
\&\*(L"rollback\*(R" (or when the application issues the next database
operation after one of those events).
.PP
In this way, the application does not have to treat these databases
as a special case.
.PP
See \*(L"commit\*(R", \*(L"disconnect\*(R" and \*(L"Transactions\*(R" for other important
notes about transactions.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`Driver\*(C'\fI\fR

same as the "\f(CW\*(C`dbi:DriverName:...\*(C'\fR\*(L" string used to connect to the database,
but with the leading \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`dbi:DriverName:\*(C'\fR" removed.
.PP

.PP
Type: string, read-only
.PP
Returns the statement string passed to the most recent \*(L"prepare\*(R" or
\&\*(L"do\*(R" method called in this database handle, even if that method
failed. This is especially useful where \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR is enabled and
the exception handler checks $@ and sees that a 'prepare' method call
failed.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`RowCacheSize\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "RowCacheSize"
.PP
Type: integer
.PP
A hint to the driver indicating the size of the local row cache that the
application would like the driver to use for future \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements.
If a row cache is not implemented, then setting \f(CW\*(C`RowCacheSize\*(C'\fR is ignored
and getting the value returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Some \f(CW\*(C`RowCacheSize\*(C'\fR values have special meaning, as follows:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  0 \- Automatically determine a reasonable cache size for each C<SELECT>
\&  1 \- Disable the local row cache
\& >1 \- Cache this many rows
\& <0 \- Cache as many rows that will fit into this much memory for each C<SELECT>.
.Ve
.PP
Note that large cache sizes may require a very large amount of memory
(\fIcached rows * maximum size of row\fR). Also, a large cache will cause
a longer delay not only for the first fetch, but also whenever the
cache needs refilling.

.SH "DBI STATEMENT HANDLE OBJECTS"
.IX Header "DBI STATEMENT HANDLE OBJECTS"
This section lists the methods and attributes associated with \s-1DBI\s0
statement handles.
.SS "Statement Handle Methods"
.IX Subsection "Statement Handle Methods"
The \s-1DBI\s0 defines the following methods for use on \s-1DBI\s0 statement handles:
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "bind_param"
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $sth\->bind_param($p_num, $bind_value)
\&  $sth\->bind_param($p_num, $bind_value, \e%attr)
\&  $sth\->bind_param($p_num, $bind_value, $bind_type)
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR method takes a copy of \f(CW$bind_value\fR and associates it
(binds it) with a placeholder, identified by \f(CW$p_num\fR, embedded in
the prepared statement. Placeholders are indicated with question
mark character (\f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR). For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  $dbh\->{RaiseError} = 1;        # save having to check each method call
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare("SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name LIKE ?");
\&  $sth\->bind_param(1, "John%");  # placeholders are numbered from 1
\&  $sth\->execute;
\&  DBI::dump_results($sth);
.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"Placeholders and Bind Values\*(R" for more information.
.PP
\&\fBData Types for Placeholders\fR
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter can be used to hint at the data type the
placeholder should have. This is rarely needed. Typically, the driver is only
interested in knowing if the placeholder should be bound as a number or a string.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->bind_param(1, $value, { TYPE => SQL_INTEGER });
.Ve
.PP
As a short-cut for the common case, the data type can be passed
directly, in place of the \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR hash reference. This example is
equivalent to the one above:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->bind_param(1, $value, SQL_INTEGER);
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR value indicates the standard (non-driver-specific) type for
this parameter. To specify the driver-specific type, the driver may
support a driver-specific attribute, such as \f(CW\*(C`{ ora_type => 97 }\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \s-1SQL_INTEGER\s0 and other related constants can be imported using
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use DBI qw(:sql_types);
.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"\s-1DBI\s0 Constants\*(R" for more information.
.PP
The data type is 'sticky' in that bind values passed to \fIexecute()\fR are bound
with the data type specified by earlier \fIbind_param()\fR calls, if any.
Portable applications should not rely on being able to change the data type
after the first \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR call.
.PP
Perl only has string and number scalar data types. All database types
that aren't numbers are bound as strings and must be in a format the
database will understand except where the \fIbind_param()\fR \s-1TYPE\s0 attribute
specifies a type that implies a particular format. For example, given:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->bind_param(1, $value, SQL_DATETIME);
.Ve
.PP
the driver should expect \f(CW$value\fR to be in the \s-1ODBC\s0 standard \s-1SQL_DATETIME\s0
format, which is '\s-1YYYY\-MM\-DD HH:MM:SS\s0'. Similarly for \s-1SQL_DATE, SQL_TIME\s0 etc.
.PP
As an alternative to specifying the data type in the \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR call,
you can let the driver pass the value as the default type (\f(CW\*(C`VARCHAR\*(C'\fR).
You can then use an \s-1SQL\s0 function to convert the type within the statement.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  INSERT INTO price(code, price) VALUES (?, CONVERT(MONEY,?))
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`CONVERT\*(C'\fR function used here is just an example. The actual function
and syntax will vary between different databases and is non-portable.
.PP
See also \*(L"Placeholders and Bind Values\*(R" for more information.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`bind_param_inout\*(C'\fI\fR

\&  $rc = $sth\->bind_param_inout($p_num, \e$bind_value, $max_len)  or die $sth\->errstr;
\&  $rv = $sth\->bind_param_inout($p_num, \e$bind_value, $max_len, \e%attr)     or ...
\&  $rv = $sth\->bind_param_inout($p_num, \e$bind_value, $max_len, $bind_type) or ...
.Ve
.PP
This method acts like \*(L"bind_param\*(R", but also enables values to be
updated by the statement. The statement is typically
a call to a stored procedure. The \f(CW$bind_value\fR must be passed as a
reference to the actual value to be used.
.PP
Note that unlike \*(L"bind_param\*(R", the \f(CW$bind_value\fR variable is not
copied when \f(CW\*(C`bind_param_inout\*(C'\fR is called. Instead, the value in the
variable is read at the time \*(L"execute\*(R" is called.
.PP
The additional \f(CW$max_len\fR parameter specifies the minimum amount of
memory to allocate to \f(CW$bind_value\fR for the new value. If the value
returned from the database is too
big to fit, then the execution should fail. If unsure what value to use,
pick a generous length, i.e., a length larger than the longest value that would ever be
returned.  The only cost of using a larger value than needed is wasted memory.
.PP
Undefined values or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR are used to indicate null values.
See also \*(L"Placeholders and Bind Values\*(R" for more information.

\&  $rc = $sth\->bind_param_array($p_num, $array_ref_or_value, $bind_type)
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`bind_param_array\*(C'\fR method is used to bind an array of values
to a placeholder embedded in the prepared statement which is to be executed
with \*(L"execute_array\*(R". For example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  $dbh\->{RaiseError} = 1;        # save having to check each method call
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare("INSERT INTO staff (first_name, last_name, dept) VALUES(?, ?, ?)");
\&  $sth\->bind_param_array(1, [ \*(AqJohn\*(Aq, \*(AqMary\*(Aq, \*(AqTim\*(Aq ]);
\&  $sth\->bind_param_array(2, [ \*(AqBooth\*(Aq, \*(AqTodd\*(Aq, \*(AqRobinson\*(Aq ]);
\&  $sth\->bind_param_array(3, "SALES"); # scalar will be reused for each row
\&  $sth\->execute_array( { ArrayTupleStatus => \emy @tuple_status } );
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW%attr\fR ($bind_type) argument is the same as defined for \*(L"bind_param\*(R".
Refer to \*(L"bind_param\*(R" for general details on using placeholders.
.PP
(Note that \fIbind_param_array()\fR can \fInot\fR be used to expand a
placeholder into a list of values for a statement like \*(L"\s-1SELECT\s0 foo
\&\s-1WHERE\s0 bar \s-1IN \s0(?)\*(R".  A placeholder can only ever represent one value
per execution.)
.PP
Scalar values, including \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, may also be bound by
\&\f(CW\*(C`bind_param_array\*(C'\fR. In which case the same value will be used for each
\&\*(L"execute\*(R" call. Driver-specific implementations may behave
differently, e.g., when binding to a stored procedure call, some
databases may permit mixing scalars and arrays as arguments.
.PP
The default implementation provided by \s-1DBI \s0(for drivers that have
not implemented array binding) is to iteratively call \*(L"execute\*(R" for
each parameter tuple provided in the bound arrays.  Drivers may
provide more optimized implementations using whatever bulk operation
support the database \s-1API\s0 provides. The default driver behaviour should
match the default \s-1DBI\s0 behaviour, but always consult your driver
documentation as there may be driver specific issues to consider.
.PP
Note that the default implementation currently only supports non-data
returning statements (\s-1INSERT, UPDATE,\s0 but not \s-1SELECT\s0). Also,
\&\f(CW\*(C`bind_param_array\*(C'\fR and \*(L"bind_param\*(R" cannot be mixed in the same
statement execution, and \f(CW\*(C`bind_param_array\*(C'\fR must be used with
\&\*(L"execute_array\*(R"; using \f(CW\*(C`bind_param_array\*(C'\fR will have no effect
for \*(L"execute\*(R".

.Ve
.PP
Perform whatever processing is necessary to execute the prepared
statement.  An \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned if an error occurs.  A successful
\&\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR always returns true regardless of the number of rows affected,
even if it's zero (see below). It is always important to check the
return status of \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR (and most other \s-1DBI\s0 methods) for errors
if you're not using \*(L"RaiseError\*(R".
.PP
For a \fInon\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement, \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR returns the number of rows
affected, if known. If no rows were affected, then \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR returns
"\f(CW0E0\fR", which Perl will treat as 0 but will regard as true. Note that it
is \fInot\fR an error for no rows to be affected by a statement. If the
number of rows affected is not known, then \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR returns \-1.
.PP
For \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements, execute simply \*(L"starts\*(R" the query within the
database engine. Use one of the fetch methods to retrieve the data after
calling \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR.  The \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR method does \fInot\fR return the number of
rows that will be returned by the query (because most databases can't
tell in advance), it simply returns a true value.
.PP
You can tell if the statement was a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement by checking if
\&\f(CW\*(C`$sth\->{NUM_OF_FIELDS}\*(C'\fR is greater than zero after calling \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR.

When called in scalar context the \fIexecute_array()\fR method returns the
number of tuples executed, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if an error occurred.  Like
\&\fIexecute()\fR, a successful \fIexecute_array()\fR always returns true regardless
of the number of tuples executed, even if it's zero. If there were any
errors the ArrayTupleStatus array can be used to discover which tuples
failed and with what errors.
.PP
When called in list context the \fIexecute_array()\fR method returns two scalars;
\&\f(CW$tuples\fR is the same as calling \fIexecute_array()\fR in scalar context and \f(CW$rows\fR is
the number of rows affected for each tuple, if available or
\&\-1 if the driver cannot determine this. \s-1NOTE,\s0 some drivers cannot determine
the number of rows affected per tuple but can provide the number of rows
affected for the batch.
If you are doing an update operation the returned rows affected may not be what
you expect if, for instance, one or more of the tuples affected the same row
multiple times.  Some drivers may not yet support list context, in which case
\&\f(CW$rows\fR will be undef, or may not be able to provide the number of rows affected
when performing this batch operation, in which case \f(CW$rows\fR will be \-1.
.PP
Bind values for the tuples to be executed may be supplied row-wise
by an \f(CW\*(C`ArrayTupleFetch\*(C'\fR attribute, or else column-wise in the
\&\f(CW@bind_values\fR argument, or else column-wise by prior calls to
\&\*(L"bind_param_array\*(R".
.PP
Where column-wise binding is used (via the \f(CW@bind_values\fR argument
or calls to \fIbind_param_array()\fR) the maximum number of elements in
any one of the bound value arrays determines the number of tuples
executed. Placeholders with fewer values in their parameter arrays
are treated as if padded with undef (\s-1NULL\s0) values.
.PP
If a scalar value is bound, instead of an array reference, it is
treated as a \fIvariable\fR length array with all elements having the
same value. It does not influence the number of tuples executed,
so if all bound arrays have zero elements then zero tuples will
be executed. If \fIall\fR bound values are scalars then one tuple
will be executed, making \fIexecute_array()\fR act just like \fIexecute()\fR.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`ArrayTupleFetch\*(C'\fR attribute can be used to specify a reference
to a subroutine that will be called to provide the bind values for
each tuple execution. The subroutine should return an reference to
an array which contains the appropriate number of bind values, or
return an undef if there is no more data to execute.
.PP
As a convenience, the \f(CW\*(C`ArrayTupleFetch\*(C'\fR attribute can also be
used to specify a statement handle. In which case the \fIfetchrow_arrayref()\fR
method will be called on the given statement handle in order to
provide the bind values for each tuple execution.
.PP
The values specified via \fIbind_param_array()\fR or the \f(CW@bind_values\fR
parameter may be either scalars, or arrayrefs.  If any \f(CW@bind_values\fR
are given, then \f(CW\*(C`execute_array\*(C'\fR will effectively call \*(L"bind_param_array\*(R"
for each value before executing the statement.  Values bound in
this way are usually treated as \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR types unless the
driver can determine the correct type (which is rare), or unless
\&\f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bind_param_inout\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bind_param_array\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`bind_param_inout_array\*(C'\fR has already been used to specify the type.
See \*(L"bind_param_array\*(R" for details.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`ArrayTupleStatus\*(C'\fR attribute can be used to specify a
reference to an array which will receive the execute status of each
executed parameter tuple. Note the \f(CW\*(C`ArrayTupleStatus\*(C'\fR attribute was
mandatory until \s-1DBI 1.38.\s0
.PP
For tuples which are successfully executed, the element at the same
ordinal position in the status array is the resulting rowcount (or \-1
if unknown).
If the execution of a tuple causes an error, then the corresponding
status array element will be set to a reference to an array containing
\&\*(L"err\*(R", \*(L"errstr\*(R" and \*(L"state\*(R" set by the failed execution.
.PP
If \fBany\fR tuple execution returns an error, \f(CW\*(C`execute_array\*(C'\fR will
return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR. In that case, the application should inspect the
status array to determine which parameter tuples failed.
Some databases may not continue executing tuples beyond the first
failure. In this case the status array will either hold fewer
elements, or the elements beyond the failure will be undef.
.PP
If all parameter tuples are successfully executed, \f(CW\*(C`execute_array\*(C'\fR
returns the number tuples executed.  If no tuples were executed,
then \fIexecute_array()\fR returns "\f(CW0E0\fR", just like \fIexecute()\fR does,
which Perl will treat as 0 but will regard as true.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 10

Support for data returning statements such as \s-1SELECT\s0 is driver-specific
and subject to change. At present, the default implementation
provided by \s-1DBI\s0 only supports non-data returning statements.
.PP
Transaction semantics when using array binding are driver and
database specific.  If \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is on, the default \s-1DBI\s0
implementation will cause each parameter tuple to be individually
committed (or rolled back in the event of an error). If \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR
is off, the application is responsible for explicitly committing
the entire set of bound parameter tuples.  Note that different
drivers and databases may have different behaviours when some
parameter tuples cause failures. In some cases, the driver or
database may automatically rollback the effect of all prior parameter
tuples that succeeded in the transaction; other drivers or databases
may retain the effect of prior successfully executed parameter
tuples. Be sure to check your driver and database for its specific
behaviour.
.PP
Note that, in general, performance will usually be better with
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR turned off, and using explicit \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR after each
\&\f(CW\*(C`execute_array\*(C'\fR call.

.PP
The \fIexecute_for_fetch()\fR method is used to perform bulk operations and
although it is most often used via the \fIexecute_array()\fR method you can
use it directly. The main difference between execute_array and
execute_for_fetch is the former does column or row-wise binding and
the latter uses row-wise binding.
.PP
The fetch subroutine, referenced by \f(CW$fetch_tuple_sub\fR, is expected
to return a reference to an array (known as a 'tuple') or undef.
.PP
The \fIexecute_for_fetch()\fR method calls \f(CW$fetch_tuple_sub\fR, without any
parameters, until it returns a false value. Each tuple returned is
used to provide bind values for an \f(CW$sth\fR\->execute(@$tuple) call.
.PP
In scalar context \fIexecute_for_fetch()\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if there were any
errors and the number of tuples executed otherwise. Like \fIexecute()\fR and
\&\fIexecute_array()\fR a zero is returned as \*(L"0E0\*(R" so \fIexecute_for_fetch()\fR is
only false on error.  If there were any errors the \f(CW@tuple_status\fR array
can be used to discover which tuples failed and with what errors.
.PP
When called in list context \fIexecute_for_fetch()\fR returns two scalars;
\&\f(CW$tuples\fR is the same as calling \fIexecute_for_fetch()\fR in scalar context and \f(CW$rows\fR is
the sum of the number of rows affected for each tuple, if available or \-1
if the driver cannot determine this.
If you are doing an update operation the returned rows affected may not be what
you expect if, for instance, one or more of the tuples affected the same row
multiple times.  Some drivers may not yet support list context, in which case
\&\f(CW$rows\fR will be undef, or may not be able to provide the number of rows affected
when performing this batch operation, in which case \f(CW$rows\fR will be \-1.
.PP
If \e@tuple_status is passed then the execute_for_fetch method uses
it to return status information. The tuple_status array holds one
element per tuple. If the corresponding \fIexecute()\fR did not fail then
the element holds the return value from \fIexecute()\fR, which is typically
a row count. If the \fIexecute()\fR did fail then the element holds a
reference to an array containing ($sth\->err, \f(CW$sth\fR\->errstr, \f(CW$sth\fR\->state).
.PP
If the driver detects an error that it knows means no further tuples can be
executed then it may return, with an error status, even though \f(CW$fetch_tuple_sub\fR
may still have more tuples to be executed.
.PP
Although each tuple returned by \f(CW$fetch_tuple_sub\fR is effectively used
to call \f(CW$sth\fR\->execute(@$tuple_array_ref) the exact timing may vary.
Drivers are free to accumulate sets of tuples to pass to the
database server in bulk group operations for more efficient execution.
However, the \f(CW$fetch_tuple_sub\fR is specifically allowed to return
the same array reference each time (which is what \fIfetchrow_arrayref()\fR
usually does).
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $sel = $dbh1\->prepare("select foo, bar from table1");
\&  $sel\->execute;
\&
\&  my $ins = $dbh2\->prepare("insert into table2 (foo, bar) values (?,?)");
\&  my $fetch_tuple_sub = sub { $sel\->fetchrow_arrayref };
\&
\&  my @tuple_status;
\&  $rc = $ins\->execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub, \e@tuple_status);
\&  my @errors = grep { ref $_ } @tuple_status;
.Ve
.PP
Similarly, if you already have an array containing the data rows
to be processed you'd use a subroutine to shift off and return
each array ref in turn:

more rows or if an error occurred. That \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR can't be distinguished
from an \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR returned because the first field value was \s-1NULL.\s0

.PP
The keys of the hash are the same names returned by \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->{$name}\*(C'\fR. If
more than one field has the same name, there will only be one entry in the
returned hash for those fields, so statements like "\f(CW\*(C`select foo, foo from bar\*(C'\fR"
will return only a single key from \f(CW\*(C`fetchrow_hashref\*(C'\fR. In these cases use
column aliases or \f(CW\*(C`fetchrow_arrayref\*(C'\fR.  Note that it is the database server

containing functions like "\f(CWcount(*)\fR\*(L" or \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`max(c_foo)\*(C'\fR" and they may clash
with existing column names (most databases don't care about duplicate column
names in a result-set). If you want these to return as unique names that are
the same across databases, use \fIaliases\fR, as in "\f(CW\*(C`select count(*) as cnt\*(C'\fR\*(L"

By default a reference to a new hash is returned for each row.
It is likely that a future version of the \s-1DBI\s0 will support an

be enabled by default because of the risk of breaking old code.

select individual columns by name. The values of the hash should be set to 1.
The key names of the returned hashes match the letter case of the names in the

If \f(CW$slice\fR is a \fIreference to a hash reference\fR, that hash is used to select

This is especially useful when you need the better performance of

.Ve
.PP
The \fIfetchall_hashref()\fR method is normally used only where the key
fields values for each row are unique.  If multiple rows are returned
with the same values for the key fields then later rows overwrite
earlier ones.

.PP
Indicate that no more data will be fetched from this statement handle
before it is either executed again or destroyed.  You almost certainly
do \fInot\fR need to call this method.
.PP
Adding calls to \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR after loop that fetches all rows is a common mistake,
don't do it, it can mask genuine problems like uncaught fetch errors.
.PP
When all the data has been fetched from a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement, the driver will
automatically call \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR for you. So you should \fInot\fR call it explicitly
\&\fIexcept\fR when you know that you've not fetched all the data from a statement
handle \fIand\fR the handle won't be destroyed soon.
.PP
The most common example is when you only want to fetch just one row,
but in that case the \f(CW\*(C`selectrow_*\*(C'\fR methods are usually better anyway.
.PP
Consider a query like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  SELECT foo FROM table WHERE bar=? ORDER BY baz
.Ve
.PP
on a very large table. When executed, the database server will have to use
temporary buffer space to store the sorted rows. If, after executing
the handle and selecting just a few rows, the handle won't be re-executed for
some time and won't be destroyed, the \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR method can be used to tell
the server that the buffer space can be freed.
.PP
Calling \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR resets the \*(L"Active\*(R" attribute for the statement.  It
may also make some statement handle attributes (such as \f(CW\*(C`NAME\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR)
unavailable if they have not already been accessed (and thus cached).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR method does not affect the transaction status of the
database connection.  It has nothing to do with transactions. It's mostly an
internal \*(L"housekeeping\*(R" method that is rarely needed.
See also \*(L"disconnect\*(R" and the \*(L"Active\*(R" attribute.

The \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR method should have been called \f(CW\*(C`discard_pending_rows\*(C'\fR.

Generally, you can only rely on a row count after a \fInon\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR
\&\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR (for some specific operations like \f(CW\*(C`UPDATE\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DELETE\*(C'\fR), or
after fetching all the rows of a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement.
.PP
For \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements, it is generally not possible to know how many
rows will be returned except by fetching them all.  Some drivers will
return the number of rows the application has fetched so far, but
others may return \-1 until all rows have been fetched.  So use of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`rows\*(C'\fR method or \f(CW$DBI::rows\fR with \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements is not
recommended.
.PP
One alternative method to get a row count for a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR is to execute a
\&\*(L"\s-1SELECT COUNT\s0(*) \s-1FROM ...\*(R" SQL\s0 statement with the same \*(L"...\*(R" as your
query and then fetch the row count from that.

.PP
Binds a Perl variable and/or some attributes to an output column
(field) of a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement.  Column numbers count up from 1.
You do not need to bind output columns in order to fetch data.
For maximum portability between drivers, \fIbind_col()\fR should be called
after \fIexecute()\fR and not before.
See also \*(L"bind_columns\*(R" for an example.
.PP
The binding is performed at a low level using Perl aliasing.
Whenever a row is fetched from the database \f(CW$var_to_bind\fR appears
to be automatically updated simply because it now refers to the same
memory location as the corresponding column value.  This makes using
bound variables very efficient.
Binding a tied variable doesn't work, currently.
.PP
The \*(L"bind_param\*(R" method
performs a similar, but opposite, function for input variables.
.PP
\&\fBData Types for Column Binding\fR
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter can be used to hint at the data type
formatting the column should have. For example, you can use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->bind_col(1, undef, { TYPE => SQL_DATETIME });
.Ve
.PP
to specify that you'd like the column (which presumably is some
kind of datetime type) to be returned in the standard format for
\&\s-1SQL_DATETIME,\s0 which is '\s-1YYYY\-MM\-DD HH:MM:SS\s0', rather than the
native formatting the database would normally use.
.PP
There's no \f(CW$var_to_bind\fR in that example to emphasize the point
that \fIbind_col()\fR works on the underlying column and not just
a particular bound variable.
.PP
As a short-cut for the common case, the data type can be passed
directly, in place of the \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR hash reference. This example is
equivalent to the one above:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->bind_col(1, undef, SQL_DATETIME);
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR value indicates the standard (non-driver-specific) type for
this parameter. To specify the driver-specific type, the driver may
support a driver-specific attribute, such as \f(CW\*(C`{ ora_type => 97 }\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \s-1SQL_DATETIME\s0 and other related constants can be imported using
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use DBI qw(:sql_types);
.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"\s-1DBI\s0 Constants\*(R" for more information.
.PP
Few drivers support specifying a data type via a \f(CW\*(C`bind_col\*(C'\fR call
(most will simply ignore the data type). Fewer still allow the data
type to be altered once set. If you do set a column type the type
should remain sticky through further calls to bind_col for the same
column if the type is not overridden (this is important for instance
when you are using a slice in fetchall_arrayref).
.PP
The \s-1TYPE\s0 attribute for \fIbind_col()\fR was first specified in \s-1DBI 1.41.\s0
.PP
From \s-1DBI 1.611,\s0 drivers can use the \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR attribute to attempt to
cast the bound scalar to a perl type which more closely matches
\&\f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR. At present \s-1DBI\s0 supports \f(CW\*(C`SQL_INTEGER\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`SQL_DOUBLE\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQL_NUMERIC\*(C'\fR. See \*(L"sql_type_cast\*(R" for details of how types are
cast.
.PP
\&\fBOther attributes for Column Binding\fR
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter may also contain the following attributes:
.ie n .IP """StrictlyTyped""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWStrictlyTyped\fR" 4
.IX Item "StrictlyTyped"
If a \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR attribute is passed to bind_col, then the driver will
attempt to change the bound perl scalar to match the type more
closely. If the bound value cannot be cast to the requested \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR
then by default it is left untouched and no error is generated. If you
specify \f(CW\*(C`StrictlyTyped\*(C'\fR as 1 and the cast fails, this will generate
an error.
.Sp
This attribute was first added in \s-1DBI 1.611.\s0 When 1.611 was released
few drivers actually supported this attribute but DBD::Oracle and
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 should from versions 1.24.
.ie n .IP """DiscardString""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWDiscardString\fR" 4
.IX Item "DiscardString"
When the \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR attribute is passed to \*(L"bind_col\*(R" and the driver
successfully casts the bound perl scalar to a non-string type
then if \f(CW\*(C`DiscardString\*(C'\fR is set to 1, the string portion of the
scalar will be discarded. By default, \f(CW\*(C`DiscardString\*(C'\fR is not set.
.Sp
This attribute was first added in \s-1DBI 1.611.\s0 When 1.611 was released

.PP
Calls \*(L"bind_col\*(R" for each column of the \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement.
.PP
The list of references should have the same number of elements as the number of
columns in the \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement. If it doesn't then \f(CW\*(C`bind_columns\*(C'\fR will
bind the elements given, up to the number of columns, and then return an error.
.PP
For maximum portability between drivers, \fIbind_columns()\fR should be called
after \fIexecute()\fR and not before.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  $dbh\->{RaiseError} = 1; # do this, or check every call for errors
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(q{ SELECT region, sales FROM sales_by_region });
\&  $sth\->execute;

\&
\&  # Bind Perl variables to columns:
\&  $rv = $sth\->bind_columns(\e$region, \e$sales);
\&
\&  # you can also use Perl\*(Aqs \e(...) syntax (see perlref docs):
\&  #     $sth\->bind_columns(\e($region, $sales));
\&
\&  # Column binding is the most efficient way to fetch data
\&  while ($sth\->fetch) {
\&      print "$region: $sales\en";

.PP
For compatibility with old scripts, the first parameter will be
ignored if it is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR or a hash reference.

Here's a more fancy example that binds columns to the values \fIinside\fR
a hash (thanks to H.Merijn Brand):

.Vb 6
\&  $sth\->execute;
\&  my %row;
\&  $sth\->bind_columns( \e( @row{ @{$sth\->{NAME_lc} } } ));

.SS "Statement Handle Attributes"
.IX Subsection "Statement Handle Attributes"
This section describes attributes specific to statement handles. Most
of these attributes are read-only.
.PP
Changes to these statement handle attributes do not affect any other
existing or future statement handles.
.PP
Attempting to set or get the value of an unknown attribute generates a warning,
except for private driver specific attributes (which all have names
starting with a lowercase letter).
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ... = $h\->{NUM_OF_FIELDS};    # get/read
.Ve
.PP
Some drivers cannot provide valid values for some or all of these
attributes until after \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->execute\*(C'\fR has been successfully
called. Typically the attribute will be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR in these situations.
.PP
Some attributes, like \s-1NAME,\s0 are not appropriate to some types of
statement, like \s-1SELECT.\s0 Typically the attribute will be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR
in these situations.

Returns a reference to an array of field names for each column. The
names may contain spaces but should not be truncated or have any
trailing space. Note that the names have the letter case (upper, lower

Also note that the name returned for (aggregate) functions like \f(CWcount(*)\fR

The values correspond to the international standards (\s-1ANSI X3.135\s0

.PP
For any character type column the value is the \s-1OCTET_LENGTH,\s0

.PP
See \*(L"ShowErrorStatement\*(R" for an example of how this is used.
.PP
* Keys:
.PP
If the driver supports \f(CW\*(C`ParamValues\*(C'\fR but no values have been bound
yet then the driver should return a hash with placeholders names
in the keys but all the values undef, but some drivers may return
a ref to an empty hash because they can't pre-determine the names.
.PP
It is possible that the keys in the hash returned by \f(CW\*(C`ParamValues\*(C'\fR

For example, DBD::Oracle translates '\f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR' placeholders into '\f(CW\*(C`:pN\*(C'\fR'
where N is a sequence number starting at 1.
.PP
* Values:
.PP
It is possible that the values in the hash returned by \f(CW\*(C`ParamValues\*(C'\fR
are not \fIexactly\fR the same as those passed to \fIbind_param()\fR or \fIexecute()\fR.
The driver may have slightly modified values in some way based on the
\&\s-1TYPE\s0 the value was bound with. For example a floating point value
bound as an \s-1SQL_INTEGER\s0 type may be returned as an integer.
The values returned by \f(CW\*(C`ParamValues\*(C'\fR can be passed to another
\&\fIbind_param()\fR method with the same \s-1TYPE\s0 and will be seen by the

.PP
It is possible that the values in the hash returned by \f(CW\*(C`ParamTypes\*(C'\fR

Param attributes specified using the abbreviated form, like this:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
are returned in the expanded form, as if called like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $sth\->bind_param(1, { TYPE => SQL_INTEGER });
.Ve
.PP
The driver may have modified the type information in some way based
on the bound values, other hints provided by the \fIprepare()\fR'd
\&\s-1SQL\s0 statement, or alternate type mappings required by the driver or target
database system. The driver may also add private keys (with names beginning
with the drivers reserved prefix, e.g., odbc_xxx).
.PP
* Example:
.PP
The keys and values in the returned hash can be passed to the various
\&\fIbind_param()\fR methods to effectively reproduce a previous param binding.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  # assuming $sth1 is a previously prepared statement handle
\&  my $sth2 = $dbh\->prepare( $sth1\->{Statement} );

\&    for keys %{ {%$ParamValues, %$ParamTypes} };
\&  $sth2\->execute();
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`ParamTypes\*(C'\fR attribute was added in \s-1DBI 1.49.\s0 Implementation

It is possible that the values in the hash returned by \f(CW\*(C`ParamArrays\*(C'\fR
are not \fIexactly\fR the same as those passed to \*(L"bind_param_array\*(R" or
\&\*(L"execute_array\*(R".  The driver may have slightly modified values in some
way based on the \s-1TYPE\s0 the value was bound with. For example a floating
point value bound as an \s-1SQL_INTEGER\s0 type may be returned as an
integer.
.PP
It is also possible that the keys in the hash returned by
\&\f(CW\*(C`ParamArrays\*(C'\fR are not exactly the same as those implied by the
prepared statement.  For example, DBD::Oracle translates '\f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR'
placeholders into '\f(CW\*(C`:pN\*(C'\fR' where N is a sequence number starting at 1.

rows on execute, whereas others wait till the first fetch.

.SH "FURTHER INFORMATION"
.IX Header "FURTHER INFORMATION"
.SS "Catalog Methods"
.IX Subsection "Catalog Methods"
An application can retrieve metadata information from the \s-1DBMS\s0 by issuing
appropriate queries on the views of the Information Schema. Unfortunately,
\&\f(CW\*(C`INFORMATION_SCHEMA\*(C'\fR views are seldom supported by the \s-1DBMS.\s0
Special methods (catalog methods) are available to return result sets
for a small but important portion of that metadata:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  column_info
\&  foreign_key_info
\&  primary_key_info
\&  table_info
\&  statistics_info
.Ve
.PP
All catalog methods accept arguments in order to restrict the result sets.
Passing \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR to an optional argument does not constrain the search for
that argument.
However, an empty string ('') is treated as a regular search criteria
and will only match an empty value.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: \s-1SQL/CLI\s0 and \s-1ODBC\s0 differ in the handling of empty strings. An
empty string will not restrict the result set in \s-1SQL/CLI.\s0
.PP
Most arguments in the catalog methods accept only \fIordinary values\fR, e.g.
the arguments of \f(CW\*(C`primary_key_info()\*(C'\fR.
Such arguments are treated as a literal string, i.e. the case is significant
and quote characters are taken literally.
.PP
Some arguments in the catalog methods accept \fIsearch patterns\fR (strings
containing '_' and/or '%'), e.g. the \f(CW$table\fR argument of \f(CW\*(C`column_info()\*(C'\fR.
Passing '%' is equivalent to leaving the argument \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\fBCaveat\fR: The underscore ('_') is valid and often used in \s-1SQL\s0 identifiers.
Passing such a value to a search pattern argument may return more rows than
expected!
To include pattern characters as literals, they must be preceded by an
escape character which can be achieved with
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $esc = $dbh\->get_info( 14 );  # SQL_SEARCH_PATTERN_ESCAPE
\&  $search_pattern =~ s/([_%])/$esc$1/g;
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1ODBC\s0 and \s-1SQL/CLI\s0 specifications define a way to change the default
behaviour described above: All arguments (except \fIlist value arguments\fR)
are treated as \fIidentifier\fR if the \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID\*(C'\fR attribute is
set to \f(CW\*(C`SQL_TRUE\*(C'\fR.
\&\fIQuoted identifiers\fR are very similar to \fIordinary values\fR, i.e. their
body (the string within the quotes) is interpreted literally.
\&\fIUnquoted identifiers\fR are compared in \s-1UPPERCASE.\s0
.PP
The \s-1DBI \s0(currently) does not support the \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID\*(C'\fR attribute,
i.e. it behaves like an \s-1ODBC\s0 driver where \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID\*(C'\fR is set to
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQL_FALSE\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Transactions"
.IX Subsection "Transactions"
Transactions are a fundamental part of any robust database system. They
protect against errors and database corruption by ensuring that sets of
related changes to the database take place in atomic (indivisible,
all-or-nothing) units.
.PP
This section applies to databases that support transactions and where
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is off.  See \*(L"AutoCommit\*(R" for details of using \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR
with various types of databases.
.PP
The recommended way to implement robust transactions in Perl
applications is to use \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eval\ {\ ...\ }\*(C'\fR
(which is very fast, unlike \f(CW\*(C`eval\ "..."\*(C'\fR). For example:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  $dbh\->{AutoCommit} = 0;  # enable transactions, if possible
\&  $dbh\->{RaiseError} = 1;
\&  eval {
\&      foo(...)        # do lots of work here
\&      bar(...)        # including inserts
\&      baz(...)        # and updates
\&      $dbh\->commit;   # commit the changes if we get this far
\&  };
\&  if ($@) {
\&      warn "Transaction aborted because $@";
\&      # now rollback to undo the incomplete changes
\&      # but do it in an eval{} as it may also fail
\&      eval { $dbh\->rollback };
\&      # add other application on\-error\-clean\-up code here
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
If the \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR attribute is not set, then \s-1DBI\s0 calls would need to be
manually checked for errors, typically like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $h\->method(@args) or die $h\->errstr;
.Ve
.PP
With \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR set, the \s-1DBI\s0 will automatically \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR if any \s-1DBI\s0 method
call on that handle (or a child handle) fails, so you don't have to
test the return value of each method call. See \*(L"RaiseError\*(R" for more
details.
.PP
A major advantage of the \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR approach is that the transaction will be
properly rolled back if \fIany\fR code (not just \s-1DBI\s0 calls) in the inner
application dies for any reason. The major advantage of using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$h\->{RaiseError}\*(C'\fR attribute is that all \s-1DBI\s0 calls will be checked
automatically. Both techniques are strongly recommended.
.PP
After calling \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR many drivers will not let you
fetch from a previously active \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement handle that's a child
of the same database handle. A typical way round this is to connect the
the database twice and use one connection for \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements.
.PP
See \*(L"AutoCommit\*(R" and \*(L"disconnect\*(R" for other important information
about transactions.
.SS "Handling \s-1BLOB / LONG /\s0 Memo Fields"
.IX Subsection "Handling BLOB / LONG / Memo Fields"
Many databases support \*(L"blob\*(R" (binary large objects), \*(L"long\*(R", or similar
datatypes for holding very long strings or large amounts of binary
data in a single field. Some databases support variable length long
values over 2,000,000,000 bytes in length.
.PP
Since values of that size can't usually be held in memory, and because
databases can't usually know in advance the length of the longest long
that will be returned from a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement (unlike other data
types), some special handling is required.
.PP
In this situation, the value of the \f(CW\*(C`$h\->{LongReadLen}\*(C'\fR
attribute is used to determine how much buffer space to allocate
when fetching such fields.  The \f(CW\*(C`$h\->{LongTruncOk}\*(C'\fR attribute
is used to determine how to behave if a fetched value can't fit
into the buffer.
.PP
See the description of \*(L"LongReadLen\*(R" for more information.
.PP
When trying to insert long or binary values, placeholders should be used
since there are often limits on the maximum size of an \f(CW\*(C`INSERT\*(C'\fR
statement and the \*(L"quote\*(R" method generally can't cope with binary
data.  See \*(L"Placeholders and Bind Values\*(R".

\&      or die "Can\*(Aqt connect to $data_source: $DBI::errstr";
\&

\&  # check for problems which may have terminated the fetch early
\&  die $sth\->errstr if $sth\->err;
\&
\&  $dbh\->disconnect;
.Ve
.PP
Here's a complete example program to insert some data from a file.
(This example uses \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR to avoid needing to check each call).
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my $dbh = DBI\->connect("dbi:DriverName:db_name", $user, $password, {
\&      RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 0
\&  });

\&      INSERT INTO table (name, phone) VALUES (?, ?)
\&  });
\&
\&  open FH, "<phone.csv" or die "Unable to open phone.csv: $!";
\&  while (<FH>) {
\&      chomp;
\&      my ($name, $phone) = split /,/;
\&      $sth\->execute($name, $phone);
\&  }
\&  close FH;
\&
\&  $dbh\->commit;
\&  $dbh\->disconnect;
.Ve
.PP
Here's how to convert fetched NULLs (undefined values) into empty strings:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  while($row = $sth\->fetchrow_arrayref) {
\&    # this is a fast and simple way to deal with nulls:
\&    foreach (@$row) { $_ = \*(Aq\*(Aq unless defined }
\&    print "@$row\en";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`q{...}\*(C'\fR style quoting used in these examples avoids clashing with
quotes that may be used in the \s-1SQL\s0 statement. Use the double-quote like
\&\f(CW\*(C`qq{...}\*(C'\fR operator if you want to interpolate variables into the string.
See \*(L"Quote and Quote-like Operators\*(R" in perlop for more details.
.SS "Threads and Thread Safety"
.IX Subsection "Threads and Thread Safety"
Perl 5.7 and later support a new threading model called iThreads.
(The old \*(L"5.005 style\*(R" threads are not supported by the \s-1DBI.\s0)
.PP
In the iThreads model each thread has its own copy of the perl
interpreter.  When a new thread is created the original perl
interpreter is 'cloned' to create a new copy for the new thread.
.PP
If the \s-1DBI\s0 and drivers are loaded and handles created before the
thread is created then it will get a cloned copy of the \s-1DBI,\s0 the
drivers and the handles.
.PP
However, the internal pointer data within the handles will refer
to the \s-1DBI\s0 and drivers in the original interpreter. Using those
handles in the new interpreter thread is not safe, so the \s-1DBI\s0 detects
this and croaks on any method call using handles that don't belong
to the current thread (except for \s-1DESTROY\s0).
.PP
Because of this (possibly temporary) restriction, newly created
threads must make their own connections to the database. Handles
can't be shared across threads.
.PP
But \s-1BEWARE,\s0 some underlying database APIs (the code the \s-1DBD\s0 driver
uses to talk to the database, often supplied by the database vendor)
are not thread safe. If it's not thread safe, then allowing more
than one thread to enter the code at the same time may cause
subtle/serious problems. In some cases allowing more than
one thread to enter the code, even if \fInot\fR at the same time,
can cause problems. You have been warned.
.PP
Using \s-1DBI\s0 with perl threads is not yet recommended for production
environments. For more information see
<http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=288022>
.PP
Note: There is a bug in perl 5.8.2 when configured with threads
and debugging enabled (bug #24463) which causes a \s-1DBI\s0 test to fail.
.SS "Signal Handling and Canceling Operations"
.IX Subsection "Signal Handling and Canceling Operations"
[The following only applies to systems with unix-like signal handling.
I'd welcome additions for other systems, especially Windows.]
.PP
The first thing to say is that signal handling in Perl versions less
than 5.8 is \fInot\fR safe. There is always a small risk of Perl
crashing and/or core dumping when, or after, handling a signal
because the signal could arrive and be handled while internal data
structures are being changed. If the signal handling code
used those same internal data structures it could cause all manner
of subtle and not-so-subtle problems.  The risk was reduced with
5.4.4 but was still present in all perls up through 5.8.0.
.PP
Beginning in perl 5.8.0 perl implements 'safe' signal handling if
your system has the \s-1POSIX\s0 \fIsigaction()\fR routine. Now when a signal
is delivered perl just makes a note of it but does \fInot\fR run the
\&\f(CW%SIG\fR handler. The handling is 'deferred' until a 'safe' moment.
.PP
Although this change made signal handling safe, it also lead to
a problem with signals being deferred for longer than you'd like.
If a signal arrived while executing a system call, such as waiting
for data on a network connection, the signal is noted and then the
system call that was executing returns with an \s-1EINTR\s0 error code
to indicate that it was interrupted. All fine so far.
.PP
The problem comes when the code that made the system call sees the
\&\s-1EINTR\s0 code and decides it's going to call it again. Perl doesn't
do that, but database code sometimes does. If that happens then the
signal handler doesn't get called until later. Maybe much later.
.PP
Fortunately there are ways around this which we'll discuss below.
Unfortunately they make signals unsafe again.
.PP
The two most common uses of signals in relation to the \s-1DBI\s0 are for
canceling operations when the user types Ctrl-C (interrupt), and for
implementing a timeout using \f(CW\*(C`alarm()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW$SIG{ALRM}\fR.
.IP "Cancel" 4
.IX Item "Cancel"
The \s-1DBI\s0 provides a \f(CW\*(C`cancel\*(C'\fR method for statement handles. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`cancel\*(C'\fR method should abort the current operation and is designed
to be called from a signal handler.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $SIG{INT} = sub { $sth\->cancel };
.Ve
.Sp
However, few drivers implement this (the \s-1DBI\s0 provides a default
method that just returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR) and, even if implemented, there
is still a possibility that the statement handle, and even the
parent database handle, will not be usable afterwards.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`cancel\*(C'\fR returns true, then it has successfully
invoked the database engine's own cancel function.  If it returns false,
then \f(CW\*(C`cancel\*(C'\fR failed. If it returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, then the database
driver does not have cancel implemented \- very few do.
.IP "Timeout" 4
.IX Item "Timeout"
The traditional way to implement a timeout is to set \f(CW$SIG{ALRM}\fR
to refer to some code that will be executed when an \s-1ALRM\s0 signal
arrives and then to call alarm($seconds) to schedule an \s-1ALRM\s0 signal
to be delivered \f(CW$seconds\fR in the future. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&  eval {
\&    local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "TIMEOUT\en" }; # N.B. \en required
\&    eval {
\&      alarm($seconds);
\&      ... code to execute with timeout here (which may die) ...
\&    };
\&    # outer eval catches alarm that might fire JUST before this alarm(0)
\&    alarm(0);  # cancel alarm (if code ran fast)
\&    die "$@" if $@;
\&  };
\&  if ( $@ eq "TIMEOUT\en" ) { ... }
\&  elsif ($@) { ... } # some other error
.Ve
.Sp
The first (outer) eval is used to avoid the unlikely but possible
chance that the \*(L"code to execute\*(R" dies and the alarm fires before it
is cancelled. Without the outer eval, if this happened your program
will die if you have no \s-1ALRM\s0 handler or a non-local alarm handler
will be called.
.Sp
Unfortunately, as described above, this won't always work as expected,
depending on your perl version and the underlying database code.
.Sp
With Oracle for instance (DBD::Oracle), if the system which hosts
the database is down the \s-1DBI\-\s0>\fIconnect()\fR call will hang for several
minutes before returning an error.
.PP
The solution on these systems is to use the \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::sigaction()\*(C'\fR
routine to gain low level access to how the signal handler is installed.
.PP
The code would look something like this (for the DBD-Oracle \fIconnect()\fR):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use POSIX qw(:signal_h);
\&
\&   my $mask = POSIX::SigSet\->new( SIGALRM ); # signals to mask in the handler
\&   my $action = POSIX::SigAction\->new(
\&       sub { die "connect timeout\en" },        # the handler code ref
\&       $mask,
\&       # not using (perl 5.8.2 and later) \*(Aqsafe\*(Aq switch or sa_flags
\&   );
\&   my $oldaction = POSIX::SigAction\->new();
\&   sigaction( SIGALRM, $action, $oldaction );
\&   my $dbh;
\&   eval {
\&      eval {
\&        alarm(5); # seconds before time out
\&        $dbh = DBI\->connect("dbi:Oracle:$dsn" ... );
\&      };
\&      alarm(0); # cancel alarm (if connect worked fast)
\&      die "$@\en" if $@; # connect died
\&   };
\&   sigaction( SIGALRM, $oldaction );  # restore original signal handler
\&   if ( $@ ) {
\&     if ($@ eq "connect timeout\en") {...}
\&     else { # connect died }
\&   }
.Ve
.PP
See previous example for the reasoning around the double eval.
.PP
Similar techniques can be used for canceling statement execution.
.PP
Unfortunately, this solution is somewhat messy, and it does \fInot\fR work with
perl versions less than perl 5.8 where \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::sigaction()\*(C'\fR appears to be broken.
.PP
For a cleaner implementation that works across perl versions, see Lincoln Baxter's
Sys::SigAction module at <http://search.cpan.org/~lbaxter/Sys\-SigAction/>.
The documentation for Sys::SigAction includes an longer discussion
of this problem, and a DBD::Oracle test script.
.PP
Be sure to read all the signal handling sections of the perlipc manual.
.PP
And finally, two more points to keep firmly in mind. Firstly,
remember that what we've done here is essentially revert to old
style \fIunsafe\fR handling of these signals. So do as little as
possible in the handler.  Ideally just \fIdie()\fR. Secondly, the handles
in use at the time the signal is handled may not be safe to use
afterwards.
.SS "Subclassing the \s-1DBI\s0"
.IX Subsection "Subclassing the DBI"
\&\s-1DBI\s0 can be subclassed and extended just like any other object
oriented module.  Before we talk about how to do that, it's important
to be clear about the various \s-1DBI\s0 classes and how they work together.
.PP
By default \f(CW\*(C`$dbh = DBI\->connect(...)\*(C'\fR returns a \f(CW$dbh\fR blessed
into the \f(CW\*(C`DBI::db\*(C'\fR class.  And the \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->prepare\*(C'\fR method
returns an \f(CW$sth\fR blessed into the \f(CW\*(C`DBI::st\*(C'\fR class (actually it
simply changes the last four characters of the calling handle class
to be \f(CW\*(C`::st\*(C'\fR).
.PP
The leading '\f(CW\*(C`DBI\*(C'\fR' is known as the 'root class' and the extra
\&'\f(CW\*(C`::db\*(C'\fR' or '\f(CW\*(C`::st\*(C'\fR' are the 'handle type suffixes'. If you want
to subclass the \s-1DBI\s0 you'll need to put your overriding methods into
the appropriate classes.  For example, if you want to use a root class
of \f(CW\*(C`MySubDBI\*(C'\fR and override the \fIdo()\fR, \fIprepare()\fR and \fIexecute()\fR methods,
then your \fIdo()\fR and \fIprepare()\fR methods should be in the \f(CW\*(C`MySubDBI::db\*(C'\fR
class and the \fIexecute()\fR method should be in the \f(CW\*(C`MySubDBI::st\*(C'\fR class.
.PP
To setup the inheritance hierarchy the \f(CW@ISA\fR variable in \f(CW\*(C`MySubDBI::db\*(C'\fR
should include \f(CW\*(C`DBI::db\*(C'\fR and the \f(CW@ISA\fR variable in \f(CW\*(C`MySubDBI::st\*(C'\fR
should include \f(CW\*(C`DBI::st\*(C'\fR.  The \f(CW\*(C`MySubDBI\*(C'\fR root class itself isn't
currently used for anything visible and so, apart from setting \f(CW@ISA\fR
to include \f(CW\*(C`DBI\*(C'\fR, it can be left empty.
.PP
So, having put your overriding methods into the right classes, and
setup the inheritance hierarchy, how do you get the \s-1DBI\s0 to use them?
You have two choices, either a static method call using the name
of your subclass:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh = MySubDBI\->connect(...);
.Ve
.PP
or specifying a \f(CW\*(C`RootClass\*(C'\fR attribute:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(..., { RootClass => \*(AqMySubDBI\*(Aq });
.Ve
.PP
If both forms are used then the attribute takes precedence.
.PP
The only differences between the two are that using an explicit
RootClass attribute will a) make the \s-1DBI\s0 automatically attempt to load
a module by that name if the class doesn't exist, and b) won't call
your \fIMySubDBI::connect()\fR method, if you have one.
.PP
When subclassing is being used then, after a successful new
connect, the \s-1DBI\-\s0>connect method automatically calls:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->connected($dsn, $user, $pass, \e%attr);
.Ve
.PP
The default method does nothing. The call is made just to simplify
any post-connection setup that your subclass may want to perform.
The parameters are the same as passed to \s-1DBI\-\s0>connect.
If your subclass supplies a connected method, it should be part of the
MySubDBI::db package.
.PP
One more thing to note: you must let the \s-1DBI\s0 do the handle creation.  If you
want to override the \fIconnect()\fR method in your *::dr class then it must still
call SUPER::connect to get a \f(CW$dbh\fR to work with. Similarly, an overridden
\&\fIprepare()\fR method in *::db must still call SUPER::prepare to get a \f(CW$sth\fR.
If you try to create your own handles using \fIbless()\fR then you'll find the \s-1DBI\s0
will reject them with an \*(L"is not a \s-1DBI\s0 handle (has no magic)\*(R" error.
.PP
Here's a brief example of a \s-1DBI\s0 subclass.  A more thorough example
can be found in \fIt/subclass.t\fR in the \s-1DBI\s0 distribution.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  package MySubDBI;
\&
\&  use strict;
\&
\&  use DBI;
\&  use vars qw(@ISA);
\&  @ISA = qw(DBI);

\&  sub prepare {
\&    my ($dbh, @args) = @_;
\&    my $sth = $dbh\->SUPER::prepare(@args)
\&        or return;

\&    return $sth;

\&
\&  package MySubDBI::st;

\&        or return $sth\->set_err(1234, "The magic failed", undef, "fetch");
\&    return $row;
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
When calling a SUPER::method that returns a handle, be careful to
check the return value before trying to do other things with it in
your overridden method. This is especially important if you want to
set a hash attribute on the handle, as Perl's autovivification will
bite you by (in)conveniently creating an unblessed hashref, which your
method will then return with usually baffling results later on like
the error \*(L"dbih_getcom handle \s-1HASH\s0(0xa4451a8) is not a \s-1DBI\s0 handle (has
no magic\*(R".  It's best to check right after the call and return undef
immediately on error, just like \s-1DBI\s0 would and just like the example
above.
.PP
If your method needs to record an error it should call the \fIset_err()\fR
method with the error code and error string, as shown in the example
above. The error code and error string will be recorded in the
handle and available via \f(CW\*(C`$h\->err\*(C'\fR and \f(CW$DBI::errstr\fR etc.
The \fIset_err()\fR method always returns an undef or empty list as
appropriate. Since your method should nearly always return an undef
or empty list as soon as an error is detected it's handy to simply
return what \fIset_err()\fR returns, as shown in the example above.
.PP
If the handle has \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`HandleError\*(C'\fR
etc. set then the \fIset_err()\fR method will honour them. This means
that if \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR is set then \fIset_err()\fR won't return in the
normal way but will 'throw an exception' that can be caught with
an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR block.
.PP
You can stash private data into \s-1DBI\s0 handles
via \f(CW\*(C`$h\->{private_..._*}\*(C'\fR.  See the entry under \*(L"\s-1ATTRIBUTES
COMMON TO ALL HANDLES\*(R"\s0 for info and important caveats.
.SH "TRACING"
.IX Header "TRACING"
The \s-1DBI\s0 has a powerful tracing mechanism built in. It enables you
to see what's going on 'behind the scenes', both within the \s-1DBI\s0 and
the drivers you're using.
.SS "Trace Settings"
.IX Subsection "Trace Settings"
Which details are written to the trace output is controlled by a
combination of a \fItrace level\fR, an integer from 0 to 15, and a set
of \fItrace flags\fR that are either on or off. Together these are known
as the \fItrace settings\fR and are stored together in a single integer.
For normal use you only need to set the trace level, and generally
only to a value between 1 and 4.
.PP
Each handle has its own trace settings, and so does the \s-1DBI.\s0
When you call a method the \s-1DBI\s0 merges the handles settings into its
own for the duration of the call: the trace flags of the handle are
\&\s-1OR\s0'd into the trace flags of the \s-1DBI,\s0 and if the handle has a higher
trace level then the \s-1DBI\s0 trace level is raised to match it.
The previous \s-1DBI\s0 trace settings are restored when the called method
returns.
.SS "Trace Levels"
.IX Subsection "Trace Levels"
Trace \fIlevels\fR are as follows:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  0 \- Trace disabled.
\&  1 \- Trace top\-level DBI method calls returning with results or errors.
\&  2 \- As above, adding tracing of top\-level method entry with parameters.
\&  3 \- As above, adding some high\-level information from the driver
\&      and some internal information from the DBI.
\&  4 \- As above, adding more detailed information from the driver.
\&      This is the first level to trace all the rows being fetched.
\&  5 to 15 \- As above but with more and more internal information.
.Ve
.PP
Trace level 1 is best for a simple overview of what's happening.
Trace levels 2 thru 4 a good choice for general purpose tracing.
Levels 5 and above are best reserved for investigating a specific
problem, when you need to see \*(L"inside\*(R" the driver and \s-1DBI.\s0
.PP
The trace output is detailed and typically very useful. Much of the
trace output is formatted using the \*(L"neat\*(R" function, so strings
in the trace output may be edited and truncated by that function.
.SS "Trace Flags"
.IX Subsection "Trace Flags"
Trace \fIflags\fR are used to enable tracing of specific activities
within the \s-1DBI\s0 and drivers. The \s-1DBI\s0 defines some trace flags and
drivers can define others. \s-1DBI\s0 trace flag names begin with a capital
letter and driver specific names begin with a lowercase letter, as
usual.
.PP
Currently the \s-1DBI\s0 defines these trace flags:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  ALL \- turn on all DBI and driver flags (not recommended)
\&  SQL \- trace SQL statements executed
\&        (not yet implemented in DBI but implemented in some DBDs)
\&  CON \- trace connection process
\&  ENC \- trace encoding (unicode translations etc)
\&        (not yet implemented in DBI but implemented in some DBDs)
\&  DBD \- trace only DBD messages
\&        (not implemented by all DBDs yet)
\&  TXN \- trace transactions
\&        (not implemented in all DBDs yet)
.Ve
.PP
The \*(L"parse_trace_flags\*(R" and \*(L"parse_trace_flag\*(R" methods are used
to convert trace flag names into the corresponding integer bit flags.
.SS "Enabling Trace"
.IX Subsection "Enabling Trace"
The \f(CW\*(C`$h\->trace\*(C'\fR method sets the trace settings for a handle
and \f(CW\*(C`DBI\->trace\*(C'\fR does the same for the \s-1DBI.\s0
.PP
In addition to the \*(L"trace\*(R" method, you can enable the same trace
information, and direct the output to a file, by setting the
\&\f(CW\*(C`DBI_TRACE\*(C'\fR environment variable before starting Perl.
See \*(L"\s-1DBI_TRACE\*(R"\s0 for more information.
.PP
Finally, you can set, or get, the trace settings for a handle using
the \f(CW\*(C`TraceLevel\*(C'\fR attribute.
.PP
All of those methods use \fIparse_trace_flags()\fR and so allow you set
both the trace level and multiple trace flags by using a string
containing the trace level and/or flag names separated by vertical
bar ("\f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR\*(L") or comma (\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR") characters. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  local $h\->{TraceLevel} = "3|SQL|foo";
.Ve
.SS "Trace Output"
.IX Subsection "Trace Output"
Initially trace output is written to \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR.  Both the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$h\->trace\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DBI\->trace\*(C'\fR methods take an optional
\&\f(CW$trace_file\fR parameter, which may be either the name of a file to be
opened by \s-1DBI\s0 in append mode, or a reference to an existing writable
(possibly layered) filehandle. If \f(CW$trace_file\fR is a filename,
and can be opened in append mode, or \f(CW$trace_file\fR is a writable
filehandle, then \fIall\fR trace output (currently including that from
other handles) is redirected to that file. A warning is generated
if \f(CW$trace_file\fR can't be opened or is not writable.
.PP
Further calls to \fItrace()\fR without \f(CW$trace_file\fR do not alter where
the trace output is sent. If \f(CW$trace_file\fR is undefined, then
trace output is sent to \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR and, if the prior trace was opened with
\&\f(CW$trace_file\fR as a filename, the previous trace file is closed; if \f(CW$trace_file\fR was
a filehandle, the filehandle is \fBnot\fR closed.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR: If \f(CW$trace_file\fR is specified as a filehandle, the filehandle
should not be closed until all \s-1DBI\s0 operations are completed, or the
application has reset the trace file via another call to
\&\f(CW\*(C`trace()\*(C'\fR that changes the trace file.
.SS "Tracing to Layered Filehandles"
.IX Subsection "Tracing to Layered Filehandles"
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Tied filehandles are not currently supported, as
tie operations are not available to the PerlIO
methods used by the \s-1DBI.\s0
.IP "\(bu" 4
PerlIO layer support requires Perl version 5.8 or higher.
.PP
As of version 5.8, Perl provides the ability to layer various
\&\*(L"disciplines\*(R" on an open filehandle via the PerlIO module.
.PP
A simple example of using PerlIO layers is to use a scalar as the output:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $scalar = \*(Aq\*(Aq;
\&    open( my $fh, "+>:scalar", \e$scalar );
\&    $dbh\->trace( 2, $fh );
.Ve
.PP
Now all trace output is simply appended to \f(CW$scalar\fR.
.PP
A more complex application of tracing to a layered filehandle is the
use of a custom layer (\fIRefer to \fRPerlio::via \fIfor details
on creating custom PerlIO layers.\fR). Consider an application with the
following logger module:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package MyFancyLogger;
\&
\&    sub new
\&    {
\&        my $self = {};
\&        my $fh;
\&        open $fh, \*(Aq>\*(Aq, \*(Aqfancylog.log\*(Aq;
\&        $self\->{_fh} = $fh;
\&        $self\->{_buf} = \*(Aq\*(Aq;
\&        return bless $self, shift;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub log
\&    {
\&        my $self = shift;
\&        return unless exists $self\->{_fh};
\&        my $fh = $self\->{_fh};
\&        $self\->{_buf} .= shift;
\&    #
\&    # DBI feeds us pieces at a time, so accumulate a complete line
\&    # before outputing
\&    #
\&        print $fh "At ", scalar localtime(), \*(Aq:\*(Aq, $self\->{_buf}, "\en" and
\&        $self\->{_buf} = \*(Aq\*(Aq
\&            if $self\->{_buf}=~tr/\en//;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub close {
\&        my $self = shift;
\&        return unless exists $self\->{_fh};
\&        my $fh = $self\->{_fh};
\&        print $fh "At ", scalar localtime(), \*(Aq:\*(Aq, $self\->{_buf}, "\en" and
\&        $self\->{_buf} = \*(Aq\*(Aq
\&            if $self\->{_buf};
\&        close $fh;
\&        delete $self\->{_fh};
\&    }
\&
\&    1;
.Ve
.PP
To redirect \s-1DBI\s0 traces to this logger requires creating
a package for the layer:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package PerlIO::via::MyFancyLogLayer;
\&
\&    sub PUSHED
\&    {
\&        my ($class,$mode,$fh) = @_;
\&        my $logger;
\&        return bless \e$logger,$class;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub OPEN {
\&        my ($self, $path, $mode, $fh) = @_;
\&        #
\&        # $path is actually our logger object
\&        #
\&        $$self = $path;
\&        return 1;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub WRITE
\&    {
\&        my ($self, $buf, $fh) = @_;
\&        $$self\->log($buf);
\&        return length($buf);
\&    }
\&
\&    sub CLOSE {
\&        my $self = shift;
\&        $$self\->close();
\&        return 0;
\&    }
\&
\&    1;
.Ve
.PP
The application can then cause \s-1DBI\s0 traces to be routed to the
logger using
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use PerlIO::via::MyFancyLogLayer;
\&
\&    open my $fh, \*(Aq>:via(MyFancyLogLayer)\*(Aq, MyFancyLogger\->new();
\&
\&    $dbh\->trace(\*(AqSQL\*(Aq, $fh);
.Ve
.PP
Now all trace output will be processed by MyFancyLogger's
\&\fIlog()\fR method.
.SS "Trace Content"
.IX Subsection "Trace Content"
Many of the values embedded in trace output are formatted using the \fIneat()\fR
utility function. This means they may be quoted, sanitized, and possibly
truncated if longer than \f(CW$DBI::neat_maxlen\fR. See \*(L"neat\*(R" for more details.
.SS "Tracing Tips"
.IX Subsection "Tracing Tips"
You can add tracing to your own application code using the \*(L"trace_msg\*(R" method.
.PP
It can sometimes be handy to compare trace files from two different runs of the
same script. However using a tool like \f(CW\*(C`diff\*(C'\fR on the original log output
doesn't work well because the trace file is full of object addresses that may
differ on each run.
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 includes a handy utility called dbilogstrip that can be used to
\&'normalize' the log content. It can be used as a filter like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    DBI_TRACE=2 perl yourscript.pl ...args1... 2>&1 | dbilogstrip > dbitrace1.log
\&    DBI_TRACE=2 perl yourscript.pl ...args2... 2>&1 | dbilogstrip > dbitrace2.log
\&    diff \-u dbitrace1.log dbitrace2.log
.Ve
.PP
See dbilogstrip for more information.
.SH "DBI ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

.SS "\s-1DBI_TRACE\s0"
.IX Subsection "DBI_TRACE"
The \s-1DBI_TRACE\s0 environment variable specifies the global default

trace output to a file. When the \s-1DBI\s0 is loaded it does:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  DBI\->trace(split /=/, $ENV{DBI_TRACE}, 2) if $ENV{DBI_TRACE};
.Ve
.PP
So if \f(CW\*(C`DBI_TRACE\*(C'\fR contains an "\f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR" character then what follows

.PP
output appended to that file. If the name begins with a number
followed by an equal sign (\f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR), then the number and the equal sign are
stripped off from the name, and the number is used to set the trace
level. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  DBI_TRACE=1=dbitrace.log perl your_test_script.pl

.IX Subsection "Support"
My consulting company, Data Plan Services, offers annual and
multi-annual support contracts for the \s-1DBI.\s0 These provide sustained
support for \s-1DBI\s0 development, and sustained value for you in return.
Contact me for details.
.SS "Sponsor Enhancements"
.IX Subsection "Sponsor Enhancements"
If your company would benefit from a specific new \s-1DBI\s0 feature,
please consider sponsoring its development.  Work is performed
rapidly, and usually on a fixed-price payment-on-delivery basis.
Contact me for details.
.PP
Using such targeted financing allows you to contribute to \s-1DBI\s0
development, and rapidly get something specific and valuable in return.
.SH "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"
.IX Header "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"
I would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of the many
people I have worked with on the \s-1DBI\s0 project, especially in the early
years (1992\-1994). In no particular order: Kevin Stock, Buzz Moschetti,
Kurt Andersen, Ted Lemon, William Hails, Garth Kennedy, Michael Peppler,
Neil S. Briscoe, Jeff Urlwin, David J. Hughes, Jeff Stander,
Forrest D Whitcher, Larry Wall, Jeff Fried, Roy Johnson, Paul Hudson,
Georg Rehfeld, Steve Sizemore, Ron Pool, Jon Meek, Tom Christiansen,
Steve Baumgarten, Randal Schwartz, and a whole lot more.
.PP
Then, of course, there are the poor souls who have struggled through
untold and undocumented obstacles to actually implement \s-1DBI\s0 drivers.
Among their ranks are Jochen Wiedmann, Alligator Descartes, Jonathan
Leffler, Jeff Urlwin, Michael Peppler, Henrik Tougaard, Edwin Pratomo,
Davide Migliavacca, Jan Pazdziora, Peter Haworth, Edmund Mergl, Steve
Williams, Thomas Lowery, and Phlip Plumlee. Without them, the \s-1DBI\s0 would
not be the practical reality it is today.  I'm also especially grateful
to Alligator Descartes for starting work on the first edition of the
\&\*(L"Programming the Perl \s-1DBI\*(R"\s0 book and letting me jump on board.
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 and DBD::Oracle were originally developed while I was Technical
Director (\s-1CTO\s0) of the Paul Ingram Group in the \s-1UK. \s0 So I'd especially like
to thank Paul for his generosity and vision in supporting this work for many years.
.PP
A couple of specific \s-1DBI\s0 features have been sponsored by enlightened companies:
.PP
The development of the \fIswap_inner_handle()\fR method was sponsored by BizRate.com (<http://BizRate.com>)
.PP
The development of DBD::Gofer and related modules was sponsored by
Shopzilla.com (<http://Shopzilla.com>), where I currently work.
.SH "CONTRIBUTING"
.IX Header "CONTRIBUTING"
As you can see above, many people have contributed to the \s-1DBI\s0 and
drivers in many ways over many years.
.PP
If you'd like to help then see <http://dbi.perl.org/contributing>.
.PP
If you'd like the \s-1DBI\s0 to do something new or different then a good way
to make that happen is to do it yourself and send me a patch to the
source code that shows the changes. (But read \*(L"Speak before you patch\*(R"
below.)
.SS "Browsing the source code repository"
.IX Subsection "Browsing the source code repository"
Use https://github.com/perl5\-dbi/dbi
.SS "How to create a patch using Git"
.IX Subsection "How to create a patch using Git"
The \s-1DBI\s0 source code is maintained using Git.  To access the source
you'll need to install a Git client. Then, to get the source code, do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  git clone https://github.com/perl5\-dbi/dbi.git DBI\-git
.Ve
.PP
The source code will now be available in the new subdirectory \f(CW\*(C`DBI\-git\*(C'\fR.
.PP
When you want to synchronize later, issue the command
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  git pull \-\-all
.Ve
.PP
Make your changes, test them, test them again until everything passes.
If there are no tests for the new feature you added or a behaviour change,
the change should include a new test. Then commit the changes. Either use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  git gui
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  git commit \-a \-m \*(AqMessage to my changes\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
If you get any conflicts reported you'll need to fix them first.
.PP
Then generate the patch file to be mailed:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  git format\-patch \-1 \-\-attach
.Ve
.PP
which will create a file 0001\-*.patch (where * relates to the commit message).
Read the patch file, as a sanity check, and then email it to dbi\-dev@perl.org.
.PP
If you have a github <https://github.com> account, you can also fork the
repository, commit your changes to the forked repository and then do a
pull request.
.SS "How to create a patch without Git"
.IX Subsection "How to create a patch without Git"
Unpack a fresh copy of the distribution:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  wget http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/T/TI/TIMB/DBI\-1.627.tar.gz
\&  tar xfz DBI\-1.627.tar.gz
.Ve
.PP
Rename the newly created top level directory:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  mv DBI\-1.627 DBI\-1.627.your_foo
.Ve
.PP
Edit the contents of \s-1DBI\-1.627\s0.your_foo/* till it does what you want.
.PP
Test your changes and then remove all temporary files:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  make test && make distclean
.Ve
.PP
Go back to the directory you originally unpacked the distribution:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  cd ..
.Ve
.PP
Unpack \fIanother\fR copy of the original distribution you started with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  tar xfz DBI\-1.627.tar.gz
.Ve
.PP
Then create a patch file by performing a recursive \f(CW\*(C`diff\*(C'\fR on the two
top level directories:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  diff \-purd DBI\-1.627 DBI\-1.627.your_foo > DBI\-1.627.your_foo.patch
.Ve
.SS "Speak before you patch"
.IX Subsection "Speak before you patch"
For anything non-trivial or possibly controversial it's a good idea
to discuss (on dbi\-dev@perl.org) the changes you propose before
actually spending time working on them. Otherwise you run the risk
of them being rejected because they don't fit into some larger plans
you may not be aware of.
.PP
You can also reach the developers on \s-1IRC \s0(chat). If they are on-line,
the most likely place to talk to them is the #dbi channel on irc.perl.org

.IP "Apache::DBI by E.Mergl@bawue.de" 4
.IX Item "Apache::DBI by E.Mergl@bawue.de"
To be used with the Apache daemon together with an embedded Perl
interpreter like \f(CW\*(C`mod_perl\*(C'\fR. Establishes a database connection which
remains open for the lifetime of the \s-1HTTP\s0 daemon. This way the \s-1CGI\s0
connect and disconnect for every database access becomes superfluous.

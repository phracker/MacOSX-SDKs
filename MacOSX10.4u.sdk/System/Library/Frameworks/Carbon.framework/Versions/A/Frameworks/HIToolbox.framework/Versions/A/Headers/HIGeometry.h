/*
 *  HIPoint
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    HIPoint is a new, floating point-based type to help express
 *    coordinates in a much richer fashion than the classic QuickDraw
 *    points. It will, in time, be more heavily used throughout the
 *    Toolbox. For now, it is replacing our use of typeQDPoint in mouse
 *    events. This is to better support sub-pixel tablet coordinates.
 *    If you ask for a mouse location with typeQDPoint, and the point
 *    is actually stored as typeHIPoint, it will automatically be
 *    coerced to typeQDPoint for you, so this change should be largely
 *    transparent to applications. HIPoints are in screen space, i.e.
 *    the top left of the screen is 0, 0.

    A Short Course on Menu Definition Functions
    
    A menu definition function is used to implement a custom visual appearance for a menu.
    Menu definition functions are still supported in Carbon, but the messages sent to a
    menu definition function in Carbon are different than for a non-Carbon application.
    
    In general, Apple recommends using the system menu definition whenever possible.
    Menu definition functions will continue to be supported, but it is not easy to write
    a correct menu definition, especially one that attempts to imitate the standard system
    menu appearance. If you require special features in your menu that the system menu
    definition does not support, please mail <toolbox@apple.com> and describe your requirements;
    we would much rather enhance the system menu definition than have you write a custom one.
    
    Menu definition functions before Carbon used the following messages:
    
        kMenuDrawMsg
        kMenuChooseMsg
        kMenuSizeMsg
        kMenuPopUpMsg
        kMenuDrawItemMsg
        kMenuCalcItemMsg
        kMenuThemeSavvyMsg
        
    kMenuChooseMsg and kMenuDrawItemMsg are not supported in Carbon and are not sent to
    Carbon menu definitions. In Carbon, kMenuChooseMsg is replaced by kMenuFindItemMsg and
    kMenuHiliteItemMsg. Menu definition functions in Carbon use the following messages:
    
        kMenuInitMsg
        kMenuDisposeMsg
        kMenuFindItemMsg
        kMenuHiliteItemMsg
        kMenuDrawItemsMsg
        kMenuDrawMsg
        kMenuSizeMsg
        kMenuPopUpMsg
        kMenuCalcItemMsg
        kMenuThemeSavvyMsg
        
    The rest of this documentation will focus on Carbon menu definitions only.
    
    Menu Definition Messages
    
        Carbon menu definition functions should support the following messages:
        
        kMenuInitMsg
            
            menuRect        unused
            hitPt           unused
            whichItem       OSErr*
        
            Sent when a menu is created. This message gives the menu definition an opportunity
            to initialize its own state. If the menu definition encounters an error while
            initializing, it should set *whichItem to a non-zero error code; this will cause the
            Menu Manager to destroy the menu and return an error back from the API that was used
            to create the menu.
        
        kMenuDisposeMsg
            
            menuRect        unused
            hitPt           unused
            whichItem       unused
            
            Sent when a menu is destroyed. This message gives the menu definition an opportunity
            to destroy its own data.
            
        kMenuFindItemMsg
            
            menuRect        menu bounds
            hitPt           point to hit-test
            whichItem       MDEFFindItemData*
            
            Sent when the Menu Manager is displaying a menu and needs to know what item is under
            the mouse. The whichItem parameter is actually a pointer to a MenuTrackingData structure.
            On entry, the menu, virtualMenuTop, and virtualMenuBottom fields of this structure are
            valid. The menu definition should determine which item containst the given point, if any,
            and fill in the itemUnderMouse, itemSelected, and itemRect fields. If an item is found,
            the menu definition should always fill in the itemUnderMouse and itemRect fields. The
            menu definition should only fill in the itemSelected field if the item is available for
            selection; if it is unavailable (because it is disabled, or for some other reason), the
            menu definition should set the itemSelected field to zero.
            
            The values placed in the itemUnderMouse and itemSelected fields should be less than or
            equal to the number of items returned by CountMenuItems on this menu. The values placed
            in these two fields should be identical if both are non-zero. itemUnderMouse should always
            be non-zero if the mouse is actually over an item.
            
            The menu definition should not hilite the found item during this message. The Menu 
            Manager will send a separate kMenuHiliteItemMsg to request hiliting of the item.
            
            If the menu definition supports scrolling, it should scroll the menu during this message,
            and update the virtualMenuTop and virtualMenuBottom fields of the MenuTrackingData to
            indicate the menu's new scrolled position.
            
            If the menu definition uses QuickDraw to draw while scrolling, it should draw into the
            current port.
    
            If the menu definition uses CoreGraphics to draw while scrolling, it should use the
            CGContextRef passed in the context field of the MDEFHiliteItemData structure.
            
            Menu definitions must use the ScrollMenuImage API, if available, to scroll the menu contents.
            This API is available in CarbonLib 1.5 and later, and in Mac OS X 10.1 and later. ScrollMenuImage
            properly supports scrolling the alpha channel in the menu's image data. Use of QuickDraw's
            ScrollRect API to scroll the menu contents will result in the alpha channel being set to 0xFF
            (opaque) and the menu will no longer be transparent.
            
            The menu definition should not modify the menu field of the MenuTrackingData.
            
        kMenuHiliteItemMsg
        
            menuRect        menu bounds
            hitPt           unused
            whichItem       MDEFHiliteItemData*
            
            Sent when the Menu Manager is displaying a menu and needs to hilite a newly selected
            item. The whichItem parameter is actually a pointer to a MDEFHiliteItemData structure.
            The menu definition should unhilite the item in the previousItem field, if non-zero,
            and hilite the item in the newItem field.
            
            Menu definitions should use the EraseMenuBackground API to erase the old menu contents
            before unhiliting a menu item, if the menu definition is using the Appearance Manager's
            menu drawing APIs. This is necessary because the background of a menu is transparent on
            Aqua, and if the old hilite is not erased first, it will show through the new unhilited
            menu background.
            
            If the menu definition uses QuickDraw to draw, it should draw into the current port.
    
            If the menu definition uses CoreGraphics to draw, it should use the CGContextRef passed
            in the context field of the MDEFHiliteItemData structure.
            
        kMenuDrawItemsMsg
        
            menuRect        menu bounds
            hitPt           unused
            whichItem       MDEFDrawItemsData*
            
            Sent when the Menu Manager is displaying a menu and needs to redraw a portion of the
            menu. This message is used by the dynamic menu item support code in the Menu Manager;
            for example, if items five and six in a menu are a dynamic group, the Menu Manager will
            send a DrawItems message when the group's modifier key is pressed or released to redraw
            the appropriate item, but no other items in the menu.
            
            The whichItem parameter for this message is actually a pointer to a MDEFDrawItemsData
            structure. The menu definition should redraw the items starting with firstItem and
            ending with lastItem, inclusive.
            
            If the menu definition uses QuickDraw to draw, it should draw into the current port.
    
            If the menu definition uses CoreGraphics to draw, it should use the CGContextRef passed
            in the context field of the MDEFDrawItemsData structure.
            
        kMenuDrawMsg
            
            menuRect        menu bounds
            hitPt           unused
            whichItem       MDEFDrawData*
            
            Sent when the Menu Manager is displaying a menu and needs to redraw the entire menu.
            The whichItem parameter is actually a pointer to a MenuTrackingData structure. On entry,
            the menu field of this structure is valid. The menu definition should draw the menu and,
            if it supports scrolling, should also fill in the virtualMenuTop and virtualMenuBottom
            fields of the structure to indicate the menu's initial unscrolled position; typically, 
            virtualMenuTop would be set to the same value as the top coordinate of the menu rect,
            and virtualMenuBottom would be set to virtualMenuTop plus the virtual height of the menu.
            
            If the menu definition uses QuickDraw to draw, it should draw into the current port.
    
            If the menu definition uses CoreGraphics to draw, it should use the CGContextRef passed
            in the context field of the MDEFDrawData structure.
            
        kMenuSizeMsg
        
            menuRect        unused
            hitPt           maximum width and height of the menu
            whichItem       unused
            
            Sent when the Menu Manager needs to determine the size of a menu. The menu definition
            should calculate the width and height of the menu and store the sizes into the menu with
            SetMenuWidth and SetMenuHeight.
            
            If the gestaltMenuMgrSendsMenuBoundsToDefProc bit is set in the Menu Manager's Gestalt
            value, then the hitPt parameter to this message is the maximum width (hitPt.h) and height
            (hitPt.v) of the menu. The menu definition should ensure that the width and height that it
            places in the menu do not exceed these values. If the gestalt bit is not set, the menu
            definition should just use the main GDevice's width and height as constraints on the menu's
            width and height.
            
        kMenuPopUpMsg
        
            menuRect        on entry, constraints on the menu's position; on exit, menu bounds
            hitPt           requested menu location, with swapped coordinates
            whichItem       on entry, requested initial selection; on exit, virtual menu top
            
            Sent when the Menu Manager is about to display a popup menu. The menu definition should
            calculate the appropriate menu bounds to contain the menu based on the requested menu
            location and selected item. It should write the menuBounds into the rect given by the
            menuRect parameter.
            
            If the gestaltMenuMgrSendsMenuBoundsToDefProc bit is set in the Menu Manager's Gestalt
            value, then the menuRect parameter on entry to this message contains a constraint rect,
            in global coordinates, outside of which the popup menu should not be positioned. The menu
            definition should take this constraint rect into account as it calculates the menu bounds.
            If the gestalt bit is not set, the menu definition should use the bounds of the GDevice
            containing the menu's top left corner as a constraint on the menu's position.
            
            The hitPt parameter is a requested location for the top left corner of the menu. The
            coordinates of this parameter are swapped from their normal order; the h field of the
            hitPt parameter contains the vertical coordinate, and the v field of hitPt contains
            the horizontal coordinate.
            
            On entry, the whichItem parameter points at a menu item index which is requested to be
            the initial selection when the menu is displayed. After calculating the menu's bounds,
            the menu definition should write the menu's virtual top coordinate into the location
            pointed at by the whichItem parameter. If displaying the menu at the requested location
            does not require scrolling, the virtual top will be the same as the menu bounds top;
            if the menu must scroll to fit in the requested location, the virtual top may be different.
            
        kMenuCalcItemMsg
        
            menuRect        on exit, item bounds
            hitPt           unused
            whichItem       the item whose rect to calculate
            
            Sent when the Menu Manager needs to know the bounds of a menu item. The menu definition
            should calculate the size of the item specified by the whichItem parameter, and store 
            the bounds in the rect specified by the menuRect parameter.
            
            Some sample menu definition code provided by Apple has previously shown an implementation
            of this message that always sets the top left corner of the item bounds to (0,0), regardless
            of the item's actual position in the menu. For best future compatibility, menu definitions
            should begin storing an item bounds that gives the item's actual position in the menu based
            on the menu's current virtual top. For example, if the virtual menu top starts at 20, then
            the menu definition would calculate an item bounds for the first item that starts at (0,20),
            an item bounds for the second item that starts at (0,40), and so on. The menu definition
            should call GetMenuTrackingData to get the menu's current virtual position, and use zero
            for the menu top if GetMenuTrackingData returns an error.
            
        kMenuThemeSavvyMsg
        
            menuRect        unused
            hitPt           unused
            whichItem       on exit, indicates theme-savvyness of the menu definition
            
            Sent by the Menu Manager to determine whether the MDEF uses the Appearance Manager 
            menu-drawing functions to draw its menu. If it does, the menu definition should return
            kThemeSavvyMenuResponse in the location pointed to by whichItem. If the menu definition
            draws its own custom content without using the Appearance Manager menu-drawing functions,
            it should ignore this message.
    
    Low-memory Global Replacements
    
        Pre-Carbon menu definitions needed to use several low-memory globals to communicate with the
        Menu Manager. These globals have all been replaced or made obsolete in Carbon, as follows:
        
        MenuDisable
            
            MenuDisable is now set automatically by the Menu Manager using the value returned in the
            itemUnderMouse field of the MenuTrackingData structure passed to kMenuFindItemMsg.
            
        TopMenuItem
        AtMenuBottom
        
            TopMenuItem and AtMenuBottom are now set automatically by the Menu Manager using the
            values returned in the virtualMenuTop and virtualMenuBottom fields of the MenuTrackingData
            structure passed to kMenuDrawMsg and kMenuFindItemMsg.
            
        mbSaveLoc
    
            This undocumented low-memory global was used by pre-Carbon menu definitions to store
            the bounding rect of the currently selected item and to avoid drawing glitches while
            the menu definition was scrolling the contents of a menu that had submenus. The Menu
            Manager now automatically sets the selected item bounds using the value returned in
            the itemRect field of the MenuTrackingData structure passed to kMenuFindItemMsg. In
            order to correctly support scrolling of menus with submenus, a menu definition should
            verify, before scrolling the menu contents, that no submenus of the scrolling menu are
            currently visible. A menu definition can use GetMenuTrackingData to verify this condition,
            as follows:
            
                Boolean SafeToScroll( MenuRef menuBeingScrolled )
                {
                    MenuTrackingData lastMenuData;
                    return GetMenuTrackingData( NULL, &lastMenuData ) == noErr
                           && lastMenuData.menu == menuBeingScrolled;
                }
            
            If SafeToScroll returns false, the menu definition should not scroll the menu.

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    It is common for state changes in an application (for example,
 *    selection of text) to cause a change in the enabling of items in
 *    the application's menu (for example, the Copy menu item might
 *    become enabled). In a Carbon-event-savvy application, menu items
 *    are enabled or disabled in response to an
 *    kEventCommandUpdateStatus event; however, this event is normally
 *    only sent before a command key press or a click in the menubar.
 *    You can request an explicit recalculation of a menu's enable
 *    state with the InvalidateMenuEnabling API. The Carbon Event
 *    Manager will automatically invalidate the enable state of all
 *    top-level menus when a user event is dispatched, the user focus
 *    changes, or the active window changes, so in many cases you will
 *    not need to explicitly invalidate the menu enabling state.

 *  SetMenuItemKeyGlyph()

 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    A menu item's command key may be customized using a key glyph
 *    code; these codes are the kMenu*Glyph constants documented in
 *    Menus.h. In classic Mac OS, a glyph code is only used for
 *    display; it does not affect command key matching. In Carbon, a
 *    menu item's glyph code is used for command key matching if the
 *    menu item does not have a command key character or virtual
 *    keycode assigned to it. 
 *    
 *    In CarbonLib 1.2 and Mac OS X 10.0 and later, the Menu Manager
 *    will automatically draw the appropriate glyph for a menu item
 *    that has a virtual keycode command key assigned to it; it is not
 *    necessary to set both the virtual keycode and the glyph for an
 *    item.

/*
 *  GetMenuItemCommandKey()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Gets the keyboard equivalent of a menu item.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    A menu item's keyboard equivalent may be either a character code
 *    or a virtual keycode. An item's character code and virtual
 *    keycode are stored separately and may contain different values,
 *    but only one is used by the Menu Manager at any given time. When
 *    requesting a menu item's virtual keycode equivalent, you should
 *    first check that the item is using a virtual keycode by testing
 *    the kMenuItemAttrUseVirtualKey attribute for that item. If this
 *    attribute is not set, the item's virtual keycode is ignored by
 *    the Menu Manager. Note that zero is a valid virtual keycode, so
 *    you cannot test the returned keycode against zero to determine if
 *    the item is using a virtual keycode equivalent. You must test the
 *    kMenuItemAttrUseVirtualKey attribute.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe

 *  CopyMenuItemData()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Returns multiple attributes of a menu item at once.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function is used to retrieve many attributes of a menu item
 *    simultaneously; for example, it might be used by a menu
 *    definition function that needs to know how to draw a menu item.
 *    It is more efficient to use this function than to use the
 *    accessor functions for the individual attributes of the menu.
 *    This function returns a copy of the data in the menu, so any data
 *    in the MenuItemDataRec that is dynamically allocated (for
 *    example, the CFString item text) should be released by the caller.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inMenu:
 *      The menu from which to copy data. If inIsCommandID is true, you
 *      may pass NULL for this parameter to search for an item in the
 *      root menu; if inIsCommandID is false, this parameter must be a
 *      valid MenuRef.
 *    
 *    inItem:
 *      The item or command ID from which to copy data.
 *    
 *    inIsCommandID:
 *      Indicates whether inItem is a MenuItemIndex or MenuCommand. If
 *      inIsCommandID is true, the inItem parameter is interpreted as a
 *      menu command ID, and data is copied from the first item in the
 *      menu with that command ID. If inIsCommandID is false, the
 *      inItem parameter is interpreted as a menu item index, and data
 *      is copied for that item in the specified menu.
 *    
 *    ioData:
 *      Data is copied from the item and placed here. On entry, the
 *      whichData field of this structure should be initialized to
 *      indicate which data the caller would like returned. Individual
 *      fields of the MenuItemDataRec structure may require

 *  ContextualMenuSelect()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Displays a contextual menu.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    If IsShowContextualMenuClick returns true, you should call the
 *    ContextualMenuSelect API after generating your own menu and
 *    preparing an Apple Event descriptor (AEDesc) that describes the
 *    item for which your application is displaying a contextual menu.
 *    This descriptor may contain an object specifier or raw data and
 *    will be passed to all contextual menu plug-ins. The system will
 *    add other items before displaying the contextual menu, and it
 *    will remove those items before returning, leaving the menu in its
 *    original state. After all the system commands are added, the
 *    contextual menu is displayed and tracked. If the user selects one
 *    of the system items, it is handled by the system and the call
 *    returns as though the user didn't select anything from the menu.
 *    If the user selects any other item (or no item at all), the Menu
 *    Manager passes back appropriate values in the parameters
 *    outUserSelectionType, outMenuID, and outMenuItem. Your
 *    application should provide visual feedback indicating the item
 *    that was clicked upon. For example, a click on an icon should
 *    highlight the icon, while a click on editable text should not
 *    eliminate the current selection. If the outUserSelectionType
 *    parameter contains kCMMenuItemSelected, you should look at the
 *    outMenuID and outMenuItem parameters to determine what menu item
 *    the user chose and handle it appropriately. If the user selected
 *    kCMHelpItemSelected, you should open the proper Apple Guide
 *    sequence or other form of custom help.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inMenu:
 *      A menu containing application commands to display. The caller
 *      creates this menu based on the current context, the mouse
 *      location, and the current selection (if it was the target of
 *      the mouse). If you pass nil, only system commands will be
 *      displayed. The menu should be added to the menu list as a
 *      pop-up menu (using the InsertMenu function).
 *    
 *    inGlobalLocation:
 *      The location (in global coordinates) of the mouse near which
 *      the menu is to be displayed.
 *    
 *    inReserved:
 *      Reserved for future use. Pass false for this parameter.
 *    
 *    inHelpType:
 *      An identifier specifying the type of help to be provided by the
 *      application; see kCMHelpItem constants.
 *    
 *    inHelpItemString:
 *      A string containing the text to be displayed for the help menu
 *      item. This string is unused unless you also pass the constant
 *      kCMHelpItemOtherHelp in the inHelpType parameter.
 *    
 *    inSelection:
 *      An object specifier for the current selection. This allows he
 *      system to examine the selection and add special system commands
 *      accordingly. Passing a value of nil indicates that no selection
 *      should be examined, and most likely, no special system actions
 *      will be included.
 *    
 *    outUserSelectionType:
 *      On exit, the value indicates what the user selected from the
 *      contextual menu; see kCMNothingSelected, kCMMenuItemSelected,
 *      and kCMShowHelpSelected.
 *    
 *    outMenuID:
 *      On exit, if outUserSelectionType is set to kCMMenuItemSelected,
 *      the value is set to the menu ID of the chosen item.
 *    
 *    outMenuItem:
 *      On exit, if outUserSelectionType is set to kCMMenuItemSelected,
 *      the value is set to the menu item chosen.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An OSStatus result code. ContextualMenuSelect returns the result
 *    code userCanceledErr and sets outUserSelectionType to

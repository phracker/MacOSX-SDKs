If there are multiple receivers the results of invoking the receivers' handlers methods are placed in an array and the array is returned; if there is a single receiver the result of invoking its handler method for this command is returned.  If the command is valid but there are no receivers, or if there are but a handler method for this command is not declared for their class, invoke -performDefaultImplementation on self and return the result.

Unless the command has received a -setScriptErrorNumber: message with a nonzero error number, execution of the command will continue and the command handlers of other receivers will be invoked.

/*! @class IOBasicOutputQueue
    @abstract A concrete implementation of an IOOutputQueue. 
    @discussion This object uses a spinlock to protect the packet queue from multiple producers.
    A single producer is promoted to become a consumer when the queue is
    not active. Otherwise, the producer will simply queue the packet and
    return without blocking.

    The flow of packets from the queue to its target can be controlled
    by calling methods such as start(), stop(), or service(). The target
    is expected to call those methods from a single threaded context,
    i.e. the work loop context in a network driver. In addition, the
    target must also return a status for every packet delivered by the
    consumer thread. This return value is the only mechanism that the
    target can use to manage the queue when it is running on the
    consumer thread.

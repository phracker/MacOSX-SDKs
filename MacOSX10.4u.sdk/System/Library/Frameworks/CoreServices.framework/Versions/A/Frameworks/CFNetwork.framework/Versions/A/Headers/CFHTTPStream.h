/*
 *  CFReadStreamCreateForHTTPRequest()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Create an HTTP read stream for the response to the given request.
 *    When the stream is opened, it will begin transmitting the
 *    request. The bytes returned are the pure body bytes; the response
 *    header has been parsed off. To retrieve the response header, ask
 *    for kCFStreamPropertyHTTPResponseHeader, above, any time after
 *    the first bytes arrive on the stream (or when stream end is
 *    reported, if there are no data bytes). When an HTTP/1.1 server
 *    returns a chunked a response, the chunks will be formed into one
 *    continuous stream.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    alloc:
 *      A pointer to the CFAllocator which should be used to allocate
 *      memory for the CF read stream and its storage for values. If
 *      this reference is not a valid CFAllocator, the behavior is
 *      undefined.
 *    
 *    request:
 *      A pointer to a CFHTTPMessage created by the
 *      CFHTTPMessageCreateRequest function.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    A pointer to the CF read stream created, or NULL if failed. It is
 *    caller's responsibilty to release the memory allocated for the
 *    read stream.

/*
 *  CFReadStreamCreateForStreamedHTTPRequest()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Creates a read stream for the response to the given
 *    requestHeaders plus requestBody. Use in preference to
 *    CFReadStreamCreateForHTTPRequest() when the body of the request
 *    is larger than you wish to be resident in memory.  Note that
 *    because streams cannot be reset, read streams created this way
 *    cannot have autoredirection enabled.  If the Content-Length
 *    header is set in requestHeaders, it is assumed that the caller
 *    got the length right and that requestBody will report
 *    end-of-stream after precisely Content-Length bytes have been read
 *    from it. If the Content-Length header is not set, the chunked
 *    transfer-encoding will be added to requestHeaders, and bytes read
 *    from requestBody will be transmitted chunked. The body of
 *    requestHeaders is ignored.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    alloc:
 *      A pointer to the CFAllocator which should be used to allocate
 *      memory for the CF read stream and its storage for values. If
 *      this reference is not a valid CFAllocator, the behavior is
 *      undefined.
 *    
 *    requestHeaders:
 *      A pointer to a CFHTTPMessage created by the
 *      CFHTTPMessageCreateRequest function. The body of requestHeaders
 *      is ignored.
 *    
 *    requestBody:
 *      A pointer to a CFReadStream.

 *  CFSocketStreamPairSetSecurityProtocol()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    CFSocketStreamPairSetSecurityProtocol has been deprecated in
 *    favor of CFReadStreamSetProperty and CFWriteStreamSetProperty
 *    with the previously mentioned property and values.  Sets the
 *    security level on a pair of streams.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    socketReadStream:
 *      Read stream reference which is to have its security level
 *      changed.
 *    
 *    socketWriteStream:
 *      Write stream reference which is to have its security level
 *      changed.
 *    
 *    securityProtocol:
 *      CFStreamSocketSecurityProtocol enum indicating the security
 *      level to be set.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    Returns TRUE if the settings were placed on the stream, FALSE
 *    otherwise.
 *  
 *  Availability:

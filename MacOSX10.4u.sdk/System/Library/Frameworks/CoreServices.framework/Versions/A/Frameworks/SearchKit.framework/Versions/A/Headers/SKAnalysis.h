/*
 *  kSKLanguageTypes
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    An array of string objects that specify the languages to use for
 *    indexing.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The kSKLanguageTypes constant is an optional key in the text
 *    analysis properties dictionary whose corresponding value is an
 *    array of string objects that together specify the languages to
 *    use for indexing. Each string should be a two character ISO 639-1
 *    code indicating a language to use. For example, 'en' for English,
 *    'ja' for Japanese, and so on. If this key is not present,
 *    SearchKit uses the Mac OS X preferences system to determine the
 *    primary language from the user's locale.
 *

 *    Mac OS X:         in version 10.3 and later in CoreServices.framework
 *    CarbonLib:        not available

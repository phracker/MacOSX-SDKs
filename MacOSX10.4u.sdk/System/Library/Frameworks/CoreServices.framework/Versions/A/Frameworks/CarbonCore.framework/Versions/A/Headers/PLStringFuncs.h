 *  Summary:
 *    Compare two pascal strings
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function compares two pascal strings, and returns a value <
 *    0 if the first string is lexicographically less than the second
 *    string, or 0 if the two strings are identical, or a value > 0 if
 *    the first string is lexicographically greater than the second.
 *    This function should be deprecated since pascal strings are
 *    obsolate on MacOSX and CFString should be used instead.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe
 *    Thread safe provided no other thread is modifying str1 or str2.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    str1:
 *      the first pascal string
 *    
 *    str2:
 *      the second pascal string
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    This function returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less
 *    than 0, according as the string str1 is greater than, equal to,
 *    or less than the string str2.  The comparison is done using
 *    unsigned characters, so that `\200' is greater than `\0'.

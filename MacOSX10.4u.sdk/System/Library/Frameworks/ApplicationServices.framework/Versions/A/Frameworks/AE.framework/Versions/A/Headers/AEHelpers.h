/*
 * AEBuild:
 *
 * AEBuild provides a very high level abstraction for building
 * complete AppleEvents and complex ObjectSpeciers.  Using AEBuild it
 * is easy to produce a textual representation of an AEDesc.  The
 * format is similar to the stdio printf call, where meta data is
 * extracted from a format string and used to build the final
 * representation.
 * 
 * For more information on AEBuild and other APIs in AEHelpers, see:
 *     <http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2045.html>

    @function LowLatencyReadIsochPipeAsync
    @abstract   Performs an asynchronous read on a isochronous pipe and updates the frame list at primary interrupt time.
    @discussion The LowLatencyReadIsochPipeAsync() and LowLatencyWriteIsochPipeAsync() 
                calls are analogous to ReadIsochPipeAsync() and WriteIsochPipeAsync(). They differ in that the frame
                list data is updated at <em>primary interrupt time</em>. This means that the client can inspect the
                frStatus and frActCount fields as soon as the transaction completes, without having to wait for the 
                callback to happen (depending on the value of updateFrequency). The callback will still happen when 
                all the frames have been received.
                
                The client can specify how often the USB stack should update the frame list data by specifying the 
                updateFrequency: this value can range from 0 - 8. If the value is between 1 and 8, the 
                frame list will be updated every updateFrequency milliseconds. If the value is 0, the 
                frame list will only be updated once all the frames in the transfer have been received. For example,
                consider a transfer with numFrames equal to 64. If the update frequency is 4, the frame 
                list data will be updated every 4 milliseconds. If the update frequency is 0, the frame list will 
                only be updated at the end of the transfer, after the 64 frames have been sent or received. The 
                difference between using an update frequency of 0 and using the non-low latency isoch calls is that 
                in the former case, the frame list will be updated at primary interrupt time, while in the latter, 
                it will be updated at secondary interrupt time. Regardless of the value of updateFrequency, 
                the frame list will <em>always</em> be updated on the last frame of a transfer.
                
                The rationale for adding this call is that because completion routines run on the USB Workloop, they 
                can be scheduled to run a number of milliseconds after the USB transfer has finished. This latency 
                is variable and depends on what other higher priority threads are running on the system. This latency 
                presents a problem for applications, such as audio processing, that depend on receiving data, 
                processing it, and sending it back out, and need to do this as fast as possible. Since applications 
                that use isochronous data know when the data should be available, they can look at the frame list at 
                the expected time and note the frActCount and frStatus (and frTimeStamp
                if needed) and determine how many valid bytes are in their data buffer and whether there was an 
                error. They can then access their data buffer and process the actual data.
                
                In order to update the frame list at primary interrupt time and to allow the client to see that 
                update, the frame list buffer needs to be shared between the kernel and user space. The same thing 
                applies to the data buffer. This is a difference between the low latency isoch calls and the regular 
                isoch calls. The LowLatencyCreateBuffer() call is used to pre-allocate the buffers. The 
                client <em>must</em> use that call to allocate the data and the frame list buffers. The client can 
                pass a portion of the buffer that was previously allocated. The USB stack will range-check the data 
                and frame list buffers to make sure they are within the ranges of the buffers previously allocated. 
                This allows the client, if it so desires, to allocate a large data buffer and pass portions of it to 
                the read or write calls. The same applies to the frame list buffers. Of course, the client can also 
                pre-allocate several data buffers and several frame list buffers and use those for each transfer. 
                Once the transfer completes, the buffers can be reused in subsequent calls. When all transfers are 
                finished, the client needs to call LowLatencyDestroyBuffer() for each buffer that was 
                created with LowLatencyCreateBuffer().
                
                The interface must be open for the pipe to exist. The buf pointer and the frameList 
                pointer need to be pre-allocated using LowLatencyCreateBuffer(). 
                After using them, they should be freed using LowLatencyDestroyBuffer().

    @param      numFrames The number of frames for which to transfer data.

                range is 0 - 8. If 0, it means that the framelist should be updated at the end of the transfer.
    @param      frameList A pointer to an array of IOUSBLowLatencyIsocFrame structures describing the frames.

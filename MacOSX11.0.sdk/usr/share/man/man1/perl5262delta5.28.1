\&\f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR now performs correct reference counting when aliasing \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR,
thus avoiding premature destruction and leakage of scalars if they are
re-aliased during execution of the sort comparator.

.IP "\(bu" 4
Failures while compiling code within other constructs, such as with string
interpolation and the right part of \f(CW\*(C`s///e\*(C'\fR now cause compilation to abort
earlier.
.Sp
Previously compilation could continue in order to report other errors, but the
failed sub-parse could leave partly parsed constructs on the parser
shift-reduce stack, confusing the parser, leading to perl crashes.

This document describes differences between the 5.28.1 release and the 5.28.2

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read
perl5281delta, which describes differences between 5.28.0 and 5.28.1.

.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another script"
.IX Subsection "Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another script"
There are several sets of digits in the Common script.  \f(CW\*(C`[0\-9]\*(C'\fR is the most
familiar.  But there are also \f(CW\*(C`[\ex{FF10}\-\ex{FF19}]\*(C'\fR (\s-1FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO\s0 \-
\&\s-1FULLWIDTH DIGIT NINE\s0), and several sets for use in mathematical notation, such
as the \s-1MATHEMATICAL\s0 DOUBLE-STRUCK DIGITs.  Any of these sets should be able to
appear in script runs of, say, Greek.  But the previous design overlooked all
but the \s-1ASCII\s0 digits \f(CW\*(C`[0\-9]\*(C'\fR, so the design was flawed.  This has been fixed,
so is both a bug fix and an incompatibility.
.PP
All digits in a run still have to come from the same set of ten digits.

.IX Item "Windows"
The Windows Server 2003 \s-1SP1\s0 Platform \s-1SDK\s0 build, with its early x64 compiler and
tools, was accidentally broken in Perl 5.27.9.  This has now been fixed.
.IP "Mac \s-1OS X\s0" 4
.IX Item "Mac OS X"
Perl's build and testing process on Mac \s-1OS X\s0 for \f(CW\*(C`\-Duseshrplib\*(C'\fR builds is now
compatible with Mac \s-1OS X\s0 System Integrity Protection (\s-1SIP\s0).
.Sp
\&\s-1SIP\s0 prevents binaries in \fI/bin\fR (and a few other places) being passed the
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\*(C'\fR environment variable.  For our purposes this prevents
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\*(C'\fR from being passed to the shell, which prevents that
variable being passed to the testing or build process, so running \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR
couldn't find \fIlibperl.dylib\fR.
.Sp
To work around that, the initial build of the \fIperl\fR executable expects to
find \fIlibperl.dylib\fR in the build directory, and the library path is then
adjusted during installation to point to the installed library.

.IP "\(bu" 4
If an in-place edit is still in progress during global destruction and the
process exit code (as stored in \f(CW$?\fR) is zero, perl will now treat the
in-place edit as successful, replacing the input file with any output produced.
.Sp
This allows code like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  perl \-i \-ne \*(Aqprint "Foo"; last\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
to replace the input file, while code like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  perl \-i \-ne \*(Aqprint "Foo"; die\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
will not.  Partly resolves [perl #133659].
.Sp
[perl #133659] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133659>

A regression in Perl 5.28 caused the following code to fail
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& close(STDIN); open(CHILD, "|wc \-l")\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
because the child's stdin would be closed on exec.  This has now been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`pack "u", "invalid uuencoding"\*(C'\fR now properly \s-1NUL\s0 terminates the zero-length
\&\s-1SV\s0 produced.

Failing to compile a format now aborts compilation.  Like other errors in
sub-parses this could leave the parser in a strange state, possibly crashing
perl if compilation continued.

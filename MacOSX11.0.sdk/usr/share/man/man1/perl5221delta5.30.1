.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.22.0 release and the 5.22.1
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.20.0, first read
perl5220delta, which describes differences between 5.20.0 and 5.22.0.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.20.0 other than the
following single exception, which we deemed to be a sensible change to make in
order to get the new \f(CW\*(C`\eb{wb}\*(C'\fR and (in particular) \f(CW\*(C`\eb{sb}\*(C'\fR features sane
before people decided they're worthless because of bugs in their Perl 5.22.0
implementation and avoided them in the future.
If any others exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.
See \*(L"Reporting Bugs\*(R" below.
.SS "Bounds Checking Constructs"
.IX Subsection "Bounds Checking Constructs"
Several bugs, including a segmentation fault, have been fixed with the bounds
checking constructs (introduced in Perl 5.22) \f(CW\*(C`\eb{gcb}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eb{sb}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eb{wb}\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eB{gcb}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eB{sb}\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`\eB{wb}\*(C'\fR.  All the \f(CW\*(C`\eB{}\*(C'\fR ones now match an empty
string; none of the \f(CW\*(C`\eb{}\*(C'\fR ones do.

A regression from Perl 5.20 has been fixed, in which some syntax errors in

.IP "\(bu" 4
Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack.  This prevents
infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes rewinding of the stack.

.IP "\(bu" 4
Nested quantifiers such as \f(CW\*(C`/.{1}??/\*(C'\fR should cause perl to throw a fatal
error, but were being silently accepted since Perl 5.20.0.  This has been
fixed.
[perl #126253] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126253>
.IP "\(bu" 4
Regular expression sequences such as \f(CW\*(C`/(?i/\*(C'\fR (and similarly with other
recognized flags or combination of flags) should cause perl to throw a fatal
error, but were being silently accepted since Perl 5.18.0.  This has been
fixed.
[perl #126178] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126178>
.IP "\(bu" 4
A bug in hexadecimal floating point literal support meant that high-order bits
could be lost in cases where mantissa overflow was caused by too many trailing
zeros in the fractional part.  This has been fixed.
[perl #126582] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126582>
.IP "\(bu" 4
Another hexadecimal floating point bug, causing low-order bits to be lost in
cases where the last hexadecimal digit of the mantissa has bits straddling the
limit of the number of bits allowed for the mantissa, has also been fixed.
[perl #126586] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126586>
.IP "\(bu" 4
Further hexadecimal floating point bugs have been fixed: In some circumstances,
the \f(CW%a\fR format specifier could variously lose the sign of the negative zero,
fail to display zeros after the radix point with the requested precision, or
even lose the radix point after the leftmost hexadecimal digit completely.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A crash caused by incomplete expressions within \f(CW\*(C`/(?[ ])/\*(C'\fR (e.g.
\&\f(CW\*(C`/(?[[0]+()+])/\*(C'\fR) has been fixed.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on

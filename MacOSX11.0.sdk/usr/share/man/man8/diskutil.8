.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Nm quiet
.Ar verb
.Op Ar options
.\"
.\"
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
manipulates the structure of local disks. It provides information about, and allows the administration of,
partitioning schemes, layouts, and formats of disks. This includes hard disks, solid state disks, optical discs,
disk images, APFS volumes, CoreStorage volumes, and AppleRAID sets.
It generally manipulates whole volumes instead of individual files and directories.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.Sh CAUTION
Many
.Nm
commands, if improperly used, can result in data loss. Most commands do not present confirmation prompts.
You should back up your data before using any of these commands.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.Sh VERBS
Each command verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.
.\"
.\" List-Begin-Verbs
.Bl -hang -width "imageinfo"
.\"             -- list --
.It Sy list Op Nm -plist
.Op Nm internal | external
.Op Nm physical | virtual
.Op Ar device
.br
List disks, including internal and external disks, whole disks and partitions,
and various kinds of virtual or offline disks.
.Pp
If no argument is given, then all whole disks and their partitions are listed.
.Pp
You can limit the number of disks shown by specifying filtering arguments such as
.Sy internal
above, and/or a
.Ar device
disk. When limiting by a disk, you can specify either a whole disk, e.g. disk0, or any of its slices,
e.g. disk0s3, but filtering is only done at the whole disk level (disk0s3 is a synonym for disk0 in this case).
.Pp
If
.Sy -plist
is specified, then a property list will be emitted instead of the normal user-readable
output.
.Pp
A script could interpret the results of
.Sy diskutil
.Sy list
.Sy -plist
and use
.Sy diskutil
.Sy info
.Sy -plist
as well as
.Sy diskutil
.Sy listFilesystems
.Sy -plist
for more detailed information.
.Pp
The top-to-bottom appearance of all whole disks is sorted in numerical order by unit (whole disk) number.
However, within each whole disk's "sublist" of partitions, the ordering
indicates actual on-disk location. The first disk item listed represents the partition which is located most near the beginning
of its encompassing whole disk, and so on.
.Pp
When viewed this way, the slice (partition) parts of the
BSD disk identifiers may, in certain circumstances, not appear in numerical order.
This is normal and is likely the result of a recent partition map
editing operation in which volumes were kept mounted.
.Pp
Note that both human-readable and plist output are sorted as described above.
.Pp
See the
.Sy DEVICES
section below for the various forms that the
.Ar device
specification may take for this and all of the other
.Nm
verbs.
.\"
.\"             -- info --
.It Sy info | information
.Op Sy -plist
.Ar device |
.Sy -all
.br
Get detailed information about a specific whole disk or partition.
If
.Sy -plist
is specified, then a property list instead of the normal user-readable output will be emitted.
If
.Sy -all
is specified, then all disks (whole disks and their partitions) are processed.
.\"
.\"             -- activity --
.It Sy activity
.br
Continuously display system-wide disk manipulation activity as reported by the Disk
Arbitration framework until interrupted with a signal (e.g. by typing
Control-C).
.Pp
This can be useful to watch system-wide activity of disks coming on-line or being ejected,
volumes on disks being mounted or unmounted, volumes being renamed, etc.
However, this output must never be parsed; programs should become Disk Arbitration clients
instead.
.Pp
For debugging
information, such as the monitoring of applications dissenting (attempting to deny) activities
for disks
for which they have registered an interest, you must use the logging features of the
.Sy diskarbitrationd
daemon. Programs needing this information must become Disk Arbitration clients.
.\"
.\"             -- listFilesystems --
.It Sy listFilesystems
.Op Nm -plist
.br
Show the file system personalities available for formatting in
.Sy diskutil
when using the erasing and partitioning verbs.
This is a subset of the complete set of
personalities exported by the various file system bundles that may be installed in the system.
Also shown are some shortcut aliases for common personalities.
See the
.Sy FORMAT
section below for more details.
If
.Sy -plist
is specified, then a property list instead of the normal user-readable output will be emitted.
.\"
.\"             -- unmount --
.It Sy unmount | umount
.Op Nm force 
.Ar device
.br
Unmount a single volume.
.Sy Force
will force-unmount the volume (less kind to any open files; see also
.Sy umount
(8)).
.\"
.\"             -- unmountDisk --
.It Sy unmountDisk | umountDisk
.Op Nm force 
.Ar device
.br
Given a disk containing a partition map, unmount all of its volumes. That is,
unmounts are attempted for the map's partitions containing file system volumes, as well as
for "virtual" volumes exported by storage systems which import data
from the map's partitions.
Storage systems supported include APFS, AppleRAID, and CoreStorage.
.Pp
.Sy Force
will force-unmount the volumes (less kind to any open files; see also
.Sy umount
(8)).
.Pp
You should specify a whole disk, but all volumes of the whole disk are attempted to be unmounted even if you specify a partition.
.\"
.\"             -- eject --
.It Sy eject Ar device
.br
Eject a disk.  Media will become offline for the purposes of being a data store for file systems or
being a member of constructs such as software RAID or direct data.  Additionally, removable media will
become eligible for safe manual removal; automatically-removable media will begin its
physical (motorized) eject sequence.
.\"
.\"             -- mount --
.It Sy mount Op Sy readOnly
.Op Sy nobrowse
.Op Sy -mountOptions Ar option Op , Ar option
.Op Sy -mountPoint Ar path
.Ar device
.br
Mount a single volume.
.Pp
If
.Sy readOnly
is specified, then the file system is mounted read-only, even if writing is
supported or allowed by the volume's underlying file system, device, media,
or user (e.g. the super-user).
If
.Sy nobrowse
is specified, then the file system is mounted with a recommendation to prevent display (e.g. by the Finder) to the end user.
These options are equivalent to passing
.Sy rdonly
or
.Sy nobrowse
as "-o" arguments to the appropriate file system bundle's
.Sy mount
(8) program.
If
.Sy -mountOptions
is specified, then the argument strings you specify will be passed (by diskarbitrationd) verbatim to
"-o"; multiple arguments must be separated with commas.
.Pp
If
.Sy -mountPoint
is specified, then your path, rather than the standard path of
/Volumes/VolumeName or /System/Volumes/VolumeName, will
be used as the view into the volume file content; a directory at that path must already exist.
.\"
.\"             -- mountDisk --
.It Sy mountDisk Ar device
.br
Mount all mountable and UI-browsable volumes on the given partition map; that is,
a mount is attempted on the directly-mountable volume, if any, on each of the whole disk's
partitions. However, "virtual" volumes, such as those are implied by e.g. Core Storage
Physical Volumes, AppleRAID Members, etc., are not handled.
You should specify a whole disk, but all volumes of the whole disk are attempted to be mounted even if you specify a partition.
.\"
.\"             -- rename --
.It Sy rename | renameVolume Ar device Ar name
.br
Rename a volume.
Volume names are subject to file system-specific alphabet and length restrictions.
.\"
.\"             -- enableJournal --
.It Sy enableJournal Ar device
.br
Enable journaling on an HFS+ volume.  This works whether or not the volume is currently mounted
(the volume is temporarily mounted if necessary).
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.\"
.\"             -- disableJournal --
.It Sy disableJournal
.Op Nm force
.Ar device
.br
Disable journaling on an HFS+ volume.  This normally works whether or not the volume is currently
mounted (the volume is temporarily mounted if necessary).  If the
.Sy force
option is specified, then journaling is disabled directly on disk; in this case, the volume
must not be mounted.
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.\"
.\"             -- moveJournal external --
.It Sy moveJournal
.Sy external
.Ar journalDevice
.Ar device
.br
Create a 512MB Apple_Journal partition using the
.Ar journalDevice
partition to serve as a journal for the volume
.Ar device.
For best results,
.Ar journalDevice
should be a partition on a different whole-disk than the volume itself.
.Pp
The journal for
.Ar device
will be moved externally onto the newly created Apple_Journal partition.
.Pp
Since the
.Ar journalDevice
you specify will invariably be larger than 512MB, a new HFS+ partition will be created
following the Apple_Journal partition to fill the remaining space.
.Pp
Moving the journal works whether or not the volume is mounted, provided
journaling is enabled on that volume. No errors are currently supported to flag attempts to
move journals on volumes that do not have journaling enabled.
If you have multiple volumes for which you want external journals, each must have its own
external Apple_Journal partition.
Ownership of the affected disks is required.
.\"
.\"             -- moveJournal internal --
.It Sy moveJournal
.Sy internal
.Ar device
.br
Move the journal for
.Ar device
back locally (onto that same device).
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.\"
.\"             -- enableOwnership --
.It Sy enableOwnership Ar device
.br
Enable ownership of a volume.  The on-root-disk Volume Database at /var/db/volinfo.database is manipulated such that
the User and Group ID settings of files, directories, and links (file system objects, or "FSOs") on the target volume
are taken into account.
.Pp
This setting for a particular volume is persistent across ejects and injects of that volume as seen
by the current OS, even across reboots of that OS, because of the entries in this OS's Volume Database.  Note thus
that the setting is not kept on the target disk, nor is it in-memory.
.Pp
For some locations of devices (e.g. internal hard disks), consideration of ownership settings on FSOs is the default.
For others (e.g. plug-in USB disks), it is not.
.Pp
When ownership is disabled, Owner and Group ID settings on FSOs appear to the user and programs as the current user and group instead
of their actual on-disk settings, in order to
make it easy to use a plug-in disk of which the user has physical possession.
.Pp
When ownership is enabled, the Owner and Group ID settings that exist on the disk are taken into account for determining
access, and exact settings are written to the disk as FSOs are created.  A common reason for
having to enable ownership is when a disk is to contain FSOs whose User and Group ID settings, and thus permissions
behavior overall, is critically important, such as when the plug-in disk contains system files to be changed or added to.
.Pp
See also the
.Xr vsdbutil 8
command.  Running as root is required.
.\"
.\"             -- disableOwnership --

.br
Disable ownership of a volume.  See
.Sy enableOwnership
above.
Running as root is required.
.\"
.\"             -- verifyVolume --
.It Sy verifyVolume Ar device
.br
Verify the file system data structures of a volume.
The appropriate fsck program is executed and
the volume is attempted to be left mounted or unmounted as it was before the command.
Any underlying Storage System (e.g. Core Storage, APFS) is verified before the target volume itself.
In certain cases, "live" verify, including of the boot volume, is supported.
Ownership of the disk to be verified is required.
.\"
.\"             -- repairVolume --
.It Sy repairVolume Ar device
.br
Repair the file system data structures of a volume.
The appropriate fsck program is executed and
the volume is attempted to be left mounted or unmounted as it was before the command.
Any underlying Storage System (e.g. Core Storage, APFS) is repaired before the given target volume.
In most cases (e.g. except mount-read-only), the target volume must be unmountable;
in all cases, the underlying storage media must be writable.
"Live" repair (e.g. of a file-writable mounted volume) is not supported.
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.\"
.\"             -- verifyDisk --
.It Sy verifyDisk Ar device
.br
Verify the partition map layout of a whole disk intended for booting or data use on a Macintosh.
The checks further include, but are not limited to, the integrity of the EFI System Partition,
the integrity of any Core Storage Physical Volume partitions,
and provisioning of space for boot loaders.
Ownership of the disk to be verified is required; it must be a whole disk and must have a partition map.
.\"
.\"             -- repairDisk --
.It Sy repairDisk Ar device
.br
Repair the partition map layout of a whole disk intended for booting or data use on a Macintosh.
The repairs further include, but are not limited to, the repair or creation of an EFI System Partition,
the integrity of any Core Storage Physical Volume partitions,
and the provisioning of space for boot loaders.
Ownership of the affected disk is required; it must be a whole disk and must have a partition map.
.\"
.\"             -- resetFusion --
.It Sy resetFusion
.br
For Fusion Drive machines (two internal disk device hardware configurations), reset the disk devices in
the machine to the factory-like state of one empty Fusion volume.
.Pp
This command will only run on a machine that contains exactly two internal disk devices:
one solid-state device (SSD) and one rotational device (HDD),
or, alternatively, two solid-state devices.
This command must be able to make a positive identification thereof.
If these requirements are met, you are prompted, and if you confirm, the erase and reset begins.
.Pp
Both internal disk devices are (re)-partitioned with GPT maps, and then they are
turned into (used to create)
an APFS Fusion Drive Container with one APFS Volume.
.Pp
All internal-disk data is lost. This includes any "extra" partitions (e.g. for
Boot Camp or other "user" purposes).
No system software is installed and no user data is restored.
After running this command, you should (re)-install macOS on the machine (on the newly-created APFS Volume);
otherwise, the machine will not be usable (bootable).
.Pp
You generally must be booted from the
Internet Recovery System (CMD-OPT-R) or from an externally-connected macOS boot disk (e.g. a USB
drive), because you cannot erase a disk that hosts the currently-running macOS.
.Pp
Externally-connected disk(s) are not affected.
Ownership of the affected disks is required.
.\"
.\"             -- eraseDisk --
.It Sy eraseDisk Ar format Ar name 
.Op Nm APM[Format] | MBR[Format] | GPT[Format]
.Ar device
.br
Erase an existing disk, removing all volumes and writing out a new partitioning scheme
containing one new empty file system volume.  If the partitioning scheme is not
specified, then an appropriate one for the current machine is chosen.
.Ar Format
is discussed below in the section for the
.Sy partitionDisk
verb.
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.\"
.\"             -- eraseVolume --
.It Sy eraseVolume 
.Ar format
.Ar name
.Ar device
.br
Write out a new empty file system volume (erasing any current file system volume) on an existing partition.
The partition remains but its data is lost.
.Ar Format
is discussed below in the section for the
.Sy partitionDisk
verb.
.Pp
If you specify
.Sy Free Space
for
.Ar format ,
the partition itself is deleted (removed entirely) from the partition map instead of merely being erased.
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.\"
.\"             -- reformat --
.It Sy reformat Ar device
.br
Erase an existing volume by writing out a new empty file system of the same personality (type) and with the
same volume name.
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.\"
.\"             -- eraseOptical --
.It Sy eraseOptical 
.Op Nm quick 
.Ar device
.br
Erase optical media (CD/RW, DVD/RW, etc.).
.Sy Quick
specifies whether the disc recording system software should do a full erase or a quick erase.
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.\"
.\"             -- zeroDisk --
.It Sy zeroDisk
.Op Nm force
.Op Nm short
.Ar device
.br
Erase a device, writing zeros to the media.  The device can be a whole-disk or a partition.
In either case, in order to be useful again, zeroed whole-disks
will need to be (re)partitioned, or
zeroed partitions will need to be (re)formatted with a file system, e.g. by using the
.Sy partitionDisk,
.Sy eraseDisk,
or
.Sy eraseVolume
verbs.
.Pp
If you desire a more sophisticated erase algorithm or if you need
to erase only free space not in use for files, use the
.Sy secureErase
verb.
.Pp
The
.Sy force
parameter causes best-effort, non-error-terminating, forced unmounts and shared-mode writes to be attempted;
however, this is still no guarantee against drivers which claim the disk exclusively. In such cases, you
may have to first unmount all overlying logical volumes (e.g. CoreStorage or AppleRAID). If a disk is partially
damaged in just a certain unlucky way, you might even have to un-install a kext or erase the disk elsewhere.
.Pp
The
.Sy short
parameter causes only a minimal amount of zeros to be written ("wipefs"); this is quick. You can use this to prevent
inadvertent identification by software, e.g. as filesystem data.
.Pp
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.\"
.\"             -- randomDisk --
.It Sy randomDisk 
.Op Ar times
.Ar device
.br
Erase a whole disk, writing random data to the media.
.Ar Times
is the optional (defaults to 1) number of times to write random information.
The device can be a whole-disk or a partition.
In either case, in order to be useful again, randomized whole-disks
will need to be (re)partitioned, or
randomized partitions will need to be (re)formatted with a file system, e.g. by using the
.Sy partitionDisk,
.Sy eraseDisk,
or
.Sy eraseVolume
verbs.
If you desire a more sophisticated erase algorithm or if you need
to erase only free space not in use for files, use the
.Sy secureErase
verb.
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.\"
.\"             -- secureErase --
.It Sy secureErase
.Op Nm freespace
.Ar level
.Ar device
.br
Erase, using a "secure" (but see the NOTE below) method,
either a whole-disk (including all of its partitions if partitioned), or,
only the free space (not in use for files) on a currently-mounted volume.
Secure erasing makes it harder to recover data using "file recovery" software.
.Pp
Erasing a whole-disk will leave it useless until it is partitioned again.
Erasing freespace on a volume will leave your files intact,
indeed, from an end-user perspective, it will appear unchanged,
with the exception that it will have attempted to make it impossible to recover deleted files.
.Pp
If you need to erase all contents of a partition but not its hosting
whole-disk, use the
.Sy zeroDisk
or
.Sy randomDisk
verbs.
Ownership of the affected disk is required.
.Pp
.Ar Level
should be one of the following:
.\" List-Begin-SecureEraseOptions
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
0 - Single-pass zero fill erase.
.It
1 - Single-pass random fill erase.
.It
2 - Seven-pass erase, consisting of zero fills and all-ones fills plus a final random fill.
.It
3 - Gutmann algorithm 35-pass erase.
.It
4 - Three-pass erase, consisting of two random fills plus a final zero fill.
.\" List-End-SecureEraseOptions
.El
.Pp
NOTE: This kind of secure erase is no longer considered safe. Modern devices have wear-leveling,
block-sparing, and possibly-persistent cache hardware, which cannot be completely erased by these
commands. The modern solution for quickly and securely
erasing your data is encryption. Strongly-encrypted data can be instantly "erased" by
destroying (or losing) the key (password), because this renders your data irretrievable in practical terms.
Consider using APFS encryption (FileVault).

.Pp
(re)Partition a disk, removing all volumes.  All volumes on this disk will be destroyed.
The
.Ar device
parameter specifies which whole disk is to be partitioned.
The optional
.Ar numberOfPartitions
parameter specifies the number of partitions to create; if given then the number of
parameter triplets (see below) is expected to match; else, the number of triplets alone
given will determine the number of partitions created.
.Pp
The optional partitioning scheme parameter forces a particular partitioning scheme; if not specified, a
suitable default is chosen.  They are:
.\" List-Begin-PartitioningSchemes
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
.Sy APM[Format]
specifies that an Apple Partition Map scheme should be used.
This is the traditional Apple partitioning scheme
used to start up a PowerPC-based Macintosh computer, to use the disk as a non-startup disk with any Mac,
or to create a multiplatform compatible startup disk.
.It
.Sy MBR[Format]
specifies that a Master Boot Record scheme should be used.
This is the DOS/Windows-compatible partitioning scheme.
.It
.Sy GPT[Format]
specifies that a GUID Partitioning Table scheme should be used.
This is the partitioning scheme
used to start up an Intel-based Macintosh computer.
.\" List-End-PartitioningSchemes
.El
.br
.Pp
For each partition, a triplet of the desired file system format, volume name, and size must be specified.
Several other
.Sy diskutil
verbs allow these triplets as well (and for them, the
.Ar numberOfPartitions
parameter is also optional).  The triplets must be as follows:
.\" List-Begin-PartitionRequestTriplets
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
.Ar Format
names are of the form jhfs+, HFS+, MS-DOS, etc.; a list of formattable file systems (more precisely, specific file system personalities exported by
the installed file system bundles)
and common aliases is available from the
.Sy listFilesystems
verb.
.Pp
.Ar Format
guides
.Sy diskutil
both in what partition type to set for the partitions (slices) as well as what file system structures to initialize therein,
using the file system bundle's plist's FormatExecutable setting which usually points to the appropriate formatter program such as
.Xr newfs_hfs 8 .
.Pp
You can specify a
.Ar format
of
.Sy Free Space
to skip an area of the disk.
.Pp
You can specify the partition type manually and directly with a
.Ar format
of %<human-readable partition type>%
such as
.Sy %Apple_HFS%
or %<GPT partition type UUID constant>%
such as
.Sy %48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC%;
these imply a
.Ar name
of
.Sy %noformat%
(below).  Human-readable types must be known to the system but UUID types (GPT scheme only) can be arbitrary.
.It
.Ar Names
are the initial volume names; they must conform to file system specific restrictions.
.Pp
If a name of
.Sy %noformat%
is specified, then the partition is left blank such that the partition space is carved out, the partition type is set
according to the file system format name or explicit type, the partition space is partially erased ("wiped"),
but a file system structure
is not initialized with any file system's formatter program (e.g.
.Ns Xr newfs_hfs 8 ; this is useful for setting up partitions that will
contain user-defined (not necessarily file system) data.
.Pp
For a triplet whose
.Ar format
is
.Sy Free Space
or a directly-specified partition type, its
.Ar name
is ignored but a dummy name must nevertheless be present.
.It
.Ar Sizes
are floating point numbers followed by a letter or percent sign as described in the
.Sy SIZES
section at the end of this page (e.g. 165536000, 55.3T, 678M, 75%, R).
.\" List-End-PartitionRequestTriplets
.El
.Pp
In addition to explicitly-requested partitions, space (gaps) might be allocated to satisfy certain filesystems'
position and length alignment requirements; space might be allocated for possible future booter partition
insertion; and indeed, actual booter partitions might be implicitly created.
.Pp
In particular, there is a rule that unrecognized partitions 1GiB or larger automatically acquire booters.
Thus, if you create an arbitrary partition with e.g.
.Sy diskutil partitionDisk disk0 gpt %11112222-1111-2222-1111-111122221111% %noformat% 3gib jhfs+ Untitled r ,
then a booter partition will also be created. You can always delete that booter with
.Sy diskutil eraseVolume \&"Free Space\&" dummy disk0s3 .
.Pp
The last partition is usually automatically lengthened to the end of the partition map (disk).
You can specify an exact size for your last partition by specifying it as the penultimate
triplet and specifying an additional (last) triplet as
.Sy Free Space .
Or you can use the
.Sy R
(remainder) size specifier for one of your middle partitions while specifying an exact size for your last partition.

Non-destructively resize a volume (partition); you may increase or decrease its size.
Alternatively, take no action and print information.
.Pp
Specifying
.Sy limits

takes no action, but instead prints the range of valid values for the target partition,
taking into account current file system and partition map conditions
such as files in use and other (immovable) partitions following the target.
.Pp
Specifying
.Sy mapsize
instead of
.Ar size
takes no action, but instead
prints the size of the encompassing whole-disk device, as well as the size of the entire partition map (all partitions less map
overhead). The whole-disk device might be
larger than the partition map if the whole-disk device has grown since the partition map was created. Growing a whole-disk device is
possible with certain enterprise disk (RAID) systems.
.Pp
The
.Sy -plist
option will print partition or whole-disk size inquiry information in property list format.
.Pp
You can grow a volume (partition) (back) to its maximum size possible, provided no new partitions have been created that are in the way, by specifying
.Sy R
for the new volume size. You should use
.Sy R
instead of attempting an absolute value such as
.Sy 100%
because the latter cannot count partition map overhead.

When decreasing the size, new partitions may optionally be created to fill the newly-freed space.
To do this, specify the

Destructively split a volume into multiple partitions.  You must supply a list of new partitions to create
in the space of the old partition; specify these with the
.Ar numberOfPartitions,
.Ar format,
.Ar name,
and
.Ar size
parameters in the same manner as the triplet description for the
.Sy partitionDisk
verb.
.Pp
For one of your triplets, you can optionally specify the

.br
Merge two or more partitions on a disk.  All data on merged partitions other than the first will be lost.
Data on the first partition will be lost as well if the
.Sy force
argument is given.
.Pp
If
.Sy force
is not given, and the first partition has a resizable file system
(e.g. JHFS+), the file system will be preserved and grown in a data-preserving manner; your
.Ar format
and
.Ar name
parameters are ignored in this case. If
.Sy force
is not given, and the first partition is not resizable, you are prompted if you want to format.
You will also be prompted to format if the first partition has an (HFS) Allocation Block Size
which is too small to support the required growth of the first partition; see the
.Sy -b
option for
.Sy newfs_hfs
(8).
.Pp
If

is given, the final resulting partition is always (re)formatted. You should do this if you wish to (re)format to a new file system type.
You will be prompted to confirm.
.Pp
.Ar Format

.Pp
Merged partitions are required to be ordered sequentially on disk (see

Create a new partition following an existing partition.
The new partition will start immediately beyond the end (start + size) of the existing partition.
.Pp
If
.Ar device
is a partition, then a new partition will be created in the gap that follows it,
formatted with the file system personality
.Ar format ,
with an initial volume name of
.Ar name ,
extending for
.Ar size ,
in the same manner as the triplet description for the
.Sy partitionDisk
verb.
.Pp
If
.Ar device
is a (partition map-bearing) whole disk, then the new partition will automatically
be placed last in the map.
.Pp
Alternatively, you can create a new partition
without any formatting by providing the partition type manually.
To do so, pass a
.Ar format
parameter in the form of
.Sy %
followed by a raw GPT UUID or valid human-readable ioContent string followed by
.Sy % ,
together with
.Sy %noformat%
for
.Ar name .
In this usage,
any old on-disk data at the location of the new partition will be "wiped"
(partially set to zeroes) to avoid any undesired interpretation.
.Pp
You can request fit-to-fill by specifying a
.Ar size
of
.Sy 0 .
.Pp
The partition map scheme must be GPT.
A gap must exist at the target location, which will generally not be the case
unless you have resized or deleted partitions.
The partition map must contain at least one entry (the EFI partition suffices).
Ownership of the affected disk is required.

.br
Apple APFS is a system of virtual volumes.
APFS verbs can be used to create, manipulate and destroy APFS Containers and their APFS Volumes.
Apple APFS defines these types of objects:
.\" List-Begin-APFSObjects
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
Container - An APFS Container imports one or more
APFS Physical Store disks and exports zero or more APFS Volume disks.
Zero or more APFS Containers can exist in (might be attached to) the system at any one time.
.Pp
While attached, the "handle" by which an APFS Container is identified is by its APFS
.Sy Container Reference
disk (device), e.g. "disk5" or "/dev/disk5". You should treat this as an opaque reference token.
.Pp
The
.Sy Container Reference
disk is a synthesized whole-disk which is exported by APFS for identification
purposes only; it has no storage. It is associated with the AppleAPFSContainerScheme node in the
IO Registry. While APFS Volume device identifiers appear to be of a related form,
you should never use the Container Reference as a basis to create device identifiers yourself;
use the listing verbs with their plist options instead.
.Pp
An APFS Container has a certain fixed size (capacity) which, via its Physical Store(s), uses
physical space on a device. An APFS Container can be resized, but this is not a part of normal operation.
.It
Physical Store - An APFS Physical Store is a disk which is imported into (that is, which backs,
indeed defines) an APFS Container. An APFS Container can import more than one Physical Store,
e.g. for Fusion-style Containers.
.Pp
An APFS Physical Store disk is not necessarily a disk from a partition map; it could be
e.g. an AppleRAID Set disk. Therefore, you must never assume that
an APFS Physical Store's disk identifier is a 2-part form such as disk0s2.
.It
Volume - An APFS Volume is an [un]mountable file system volume which is exported from an APFS Container.
Zero or more APFS Volumes may be exported out of an APFS Container.
.Pp
An APFS Volume is identified by its device node, e.g. "disk5s1" or "/dev/disk5s1". The term
.Sy volumeDevice
is used below to refer to this device node.
.Pp
APFS Volumes have no specified "size" (capacity). Instead, all APFS Volumes consume capacity out of
the remaining free space of their parent APFS Container, consuming or returning such capacity as
user file data is added or deleted. Note that this means that all Volumes within a
Container compete for the Container's remaining capacity. However, you can manage Volume allocation
with the optional
.Sy reserve
and
.Sy quota
size values.
.Pp
The optional
.Sy reserve
size requests an assured minimum capacity for an APFS Volume. If successfully created, the Volume is guaranteed
to be able to store at least this many bytes of user file data. Note that beyond this, the Volume might
be able to store even more until constrained by reaching zero free space in its parent Container
or by reaching a quota, if any. You can use a
.Sy reserve
to prevent running out of capacity due to competition from other Volumes or from a Container shrink attempt.
.Pp
The optional
.Sy quota
size applies a maximum capacity to an APFS Volume, placing a limit on the number of bytes of user file data
which can be stored on the Volume. Note that you might not be able to reach this limit if its parent Container
becomes full first. You can use a
.Sy quota
to enforce accounting or to manage against "unfair" premature filling-up of
the parent Container due solely to this Volume at the expense of sibling Volumes.
.Pp
APFS Volumes can be tagged with zero or more
.Sy role
metadata flags which give a hint as to their intended use.
Not all combinations of flags are valid, and not all flags are allowed to be set or changed by a user.
.Pp
Efficient file copy cloning (copy-on-write) is supported; see
.Ns Xr copyfile 3
.Sy COPYFILE_CLONE.
.Pp
Optional volume-level encryption is supported (see also Volume Groups below).
An APFS Volume can be in an encrypted state because it was converted from a Core Storage encrypted volume,
or because it was created as encrypted from its inception
(e.g. with the
.Sy diskutil apfs addVolume -passphrase
verb)
or because FileVault was enabled on it at some later time.
On machines that support hardware encryption, the on-disk-device data for local volumes is encrypted even if
FileVault is not enabled; this is termed "encrypted at rest".
.Pp
The format of an APFS Volume's device identifier (volumeDevice) is that of a slice disk of a special whole-disk;
both disks are synthesized by APFS. The "whole" identifier number (a positive possibly-multi-digit integer)
is arbitrary, and the "slice" numbers (positive possibly-multi-digit integers) count up from 1 with each
new Volume. Deleting Volumes may cause gaps in the numbering.
This form appears the same as a partition (map) scheme and partitions, but it is completely unrelated.
For example: If "disk3s2" is a Physical Store defining a Container, then "disk5s1", "disk5s2", and "disk5s3"
might be the Container's Volumes; "disk5" exists but is never used directly.
.Pp
Although it has a device node, an APFS Volume's data may only be accessed through its files;
3rd-party code cannot open an APFS Volume device node to "directly" access its on-disk bytes.
.It
Snapshot - An APFS Snapshot represents a read-only copy of its parent (or "base") APFS Volume, frozen at the moment of its creation.
An APFS Volume can have zero or more associated APFS Snapshots.
.Pp
APFS Snapshots are normally not discoverable unless the "base" or one of the snapshots is mounted. APFS Snapshots are uniquely
identified with a UUID (preferred) or within their parent Volume's namespace by either a numeric identifier or by their name;
they can be renamed, but APFS will never allow duplication of names (within a Volume) to occur.
.Pp
APFS Snapshots are mountable; when this occurs, its mount point (separate from and simultaneous with its parent Volume)
provides a read-only historic version of the Volume content at Snapshot creation time.
.Pp
You can
.Sy revert
the present state of an APFS Volume back to equality with a Snapshot in its history. This is a
destructive reset/restore operation: Once a Volume is reverted, it cannot be brought forward.
Any Snapshots between the revert point and the present are lost as well.
.Pp
You can
.Sy delete
a Snapshot; this removes the possibility of ever reverting to that Snapshot's state, but does
not affect the Volume's present-time content.
.Pp
An APFS Snapshot mount point's "source device" (its
.Ns Xr statfs 2
.Sy f_mntfromname
shown by the
.Ns Xr mount 8
command) is not necessarily a device node (e.g. disk0s2) as is common;
it can be the Snapshot name followed by the '@' character and the "parent" Volume's device node,
e.g. "SnapName123@/dev/disk2s1".
See the
.Ns Xr mount_apfs 8
.Sy -s
and
.Ns Xr fs_snapshot_create 2
commands. However, it is also possible for
.Sy f_mntfromname
to have a 3-part form ("diskCsVsS") if you are rooted (booted) from
an APFS Snapshot; in this case, its "base" Volume (e.g. "diskCsV") will
.Sy not
be mounted.
.It
Volume Group - Collections of APFS Volumes can be associated with each other via an APFS Volume Group.
Zero or more APFS Volume Groups may exist on any given APFS Container. The "members" (APFS Volumes)
of any particular APFS Volume Group must all be on the same APFS Container. There is no such thing as
an "empty" (zero-member) APFS Volume Group.
.Pp
APFS Volume Groups are identified using their Volume Group ID (a UUID). Assignment of this ID
may be deferred in some cases.
.Pp
A primary use for APFS Volume Groups is realization of macOS installations in which
"System"-role (for the operating system) and "Data"-role (for user data) APFS Volumes are
functionally linked (overlaid file namespace, crypto info), yet separated for reasons of security, backup, and software update.
.Pp
Cryptographic identity, if any, is shared among all members of an APFS Volume Group.
.\" List-End-APFSObjects
.El
.Pp
APFS itself has no provision for backing up your data.
Backups should be always be performed on a regular basis and before modifying any APFS Container using these commands.
.Pp
The following is a list of
.Sy APFS
sub-verbs with their descriptions and individual arguments.
.br

.\" List-Begin-APFSVerbs
.Bl -hang -width "imageinfo"
.\"
.\"             -- APFS > list --

.br
Display APFS objects as a tree. APFS Container(s) are shown with
their imported Physical Store(s) and exported Volume(s).
.Pp
All currently-attached APFS Containers in the system are listed unless you specify a
.Ar containerReferenceDevice ,
which limits the output to that specific APFS Container family.
.Pp
If
.Sy -plist
is specified, then a property list will be emitted
instead of the normal user-readable output.
.\"
.\"             -- APFS > convert  --
.It Sy convert Ar device
.Op Nm -dryrun
.Op Nm -prebootSource Ar yourStagingDirectory
.Op Nm -noPrebootAdditions
.br
Non-destructively convert an HFS volume to an APFS Container with a single (but see below)
APFS Volume. The APFS Container can later be manipulated (e.g. adding and deleting APFS Volumes) as usual.
This verb can be used to convert nonbootable "data"-only volumes as well as "macOS" volumes (see below).
.Pp
The source HFS volume can be located on a GPT partition or on an encrypted or non-encrypted, Fusion or non-Fusion
CoreStorage logical volume (LV).
In the latter case, the CoreStorage logical volume group (LVG) is dismantled, including automatic removal
of any related Boot Camp Assistant partition(s).
.Pp
If
.Sy -dryrun
is specified, all calculations, checks, and some data moving is performed, but your disk is
left as valid HFS (headers remain declared as HFS, partition types are left alone, etc).
.Pp
For volumes currently or planned to be macOS-bearing (and bootable), you can optionally specify
.Sy -prebootSource
with your own staging directory of macOS boot items; a Preboot Role APFS Volume with a UUID directory
will automatically be created as part of the conversion process to facilitate macOS bootstrap.
Normally your directory should be writable;
additional (cryptographic and EFI rendering) items are automatically added to your directory
prior to conversion and are not removed afterwards.
You can opt-out of automatic item addition with the
.Sy -noPrebootAdditions
option.
.Pp
Ownership of the affected disks is required.
.\"
.\"             -- APFS > create  --
.It Sy create Ar device
.Op Ar device
.Ar name
.br
Convenience verb which creates an empty APFS Container and then adds one APFS Volume with the given name.
The APFS Volume will have default attributes such as no encryption, no capacity reserve nor quota, etc.
If you specify more than one device, a Fusion Container is created, with the performance parts assigned automatically.
This is a combination of the
.Sy diskutil apfs createContainer
and
.Sy diskutil apfs addVolume
verbs.
.Pp
Ownership of the affected disks is required.
.\"
.\"             -- APFS > createContainer --
.It Sy createContainer
.Op Sy -main
.Ar device
.Op Sy -secondary
.Op Ar device
.br
Create an empty APFS Container.
The device(s) specified become APFS Physical Stores.
If you specify more than one device, a Fusion Container is created.
.Pp
For Fusion cases, if you do not explicitly use the
.Sy -main
and
.Sy -secondary
options, the performance duties are assigned automatically; this is preferred.
Rotational vs. solid-state hardware design must be detectable;
this is often not the case for external disks. Solid-state hardware is welcome but
not required; it is the identification which holds as a hard requirement with this usage.
.Pp
Alternatively, you can explicitly specify
.Sy -main
and
.Sy -secondary
devices; if you do so, you must specify both.
The "main" device is assumed to be "faster" (you should use solid-state hardware if available),
while the "secondary" device is assumed to be "slower" and is often used to store OS-associated
"auxiliary" data such as a Boot Camp Assistant partition.
.Pp
You cannot mix the use of disks from a disk image and not from a disk image.
.Pp
After running this command, you may add APFS Volumes with the
.Sy diskutil apfs addVolume
verb; you must do this at least once in order to "use" the new Container.
.Pp
Ownership of the affected disks is required.
.\"

.It Sy deleteContainer
.Op Sy -force
.Ar containerReferenceDevice | physicalStoreDevice
.Op Ar newName
.Op Ar newFormat Ar newName Ar newSize
.br
Destroy an existing APFS Container, including all of its APFS Volumes.
Data on all of those volumes will be lost.
.Pp
You can identify the APFS Container by its Container Reference disk (preferred), or by one
of its Physical Store disk(s).
.Pp
The APFS Volumes are unmounted first; this process may not succeed if one or more is busy,
in which case deleteContainer is aborted and all data is left intact
(although some volumes might now be unmounted).
.Pp
Otherwise, all APFS Volumes are deleted, their encryption-store
entries are removed as applicable, the parent APFS Container is deleted, and
the APFS Container's former Physical Store(s) are disposed of as follows:
.Pp
If you did not specify a
.Ar newName
and all Physical Stores are
partitions, then those partitions are deleted (turned into free space).
You might then wish to use
.Sy diskutil addPartition
to re-purpose the newly-created gap in your partition map.
.Pp
If you did specify a
.Ar newName ,
or if one or more Physical Stores are whole disks (e.g. AppleRAID), then they are reformatted
(as something other than APFS) with volume name(s) based on
.Ar newName .
.Pp
If you specified the triplet of
.Ar newFormat Ar newName Ar newSize
in the same manner as when using the
.Sy partitionDisk
verb, then they are each reformatted with the specified format and volume names based on
.Ar newName .
Only a
.Ar newSize
of
.Sy 0
(fit-to-fill) is currently supported.
.Pp
If your APFS Container is damaged, a Container Reference for it might not exist or it might not
be functional. In this case, you can reclaim your former APFS Physical Store disk(s) by specifying the
.Sy -force
option; this activates an alternate last-resort mode. In this mode,
if you had more than one Physical Store (e.g. the Fusion case) and the Container is sufficiently damaged,
you might have to delete each Physical Store manually.
You should normally avoid this mode.
.Pp
Ownership of the affected disks is required.

.br
Resize an existing APFS Container by specifying either an APFS Container Reference (preferred)
or an APFS Physical Store partition, plus a proposed new size.
Alternatively, take no action and print constraint information.
The operation is live, non-destructive, and does not mount or unmount any APFS Volumes.
.Pp
If you specify an APFS Container Reference and that Container imports more than one Physical Store (in e.g. Fusion setups),
the appropriate Physical Store will be chosen automatically.
.Pp
Specifying
.Sy limits
instead of a
.Ar size
causes no action to be taken, but instead
prints a range of valid values, taking into account various constraints; the
.Sy -plist
option will print this information in property list format.
.Pp
Shrinks are constrained by the amount of data usage by all APFS Volumes on the targeted or implied APFS Container.
Contributing to this data usage is the file content on the APFS Volumes, the
existence of quotas and/or reserves, the usage of APFS Snapshots (e.g. by Time Machine),
and metadata overhead.
.Pp
Grows are constrained by the amount of partition map free space trailing the targeted or implied Physical Store partition.
.Pp
When shrinking, new partitions may optionally be created to fill the newly-freed space.
To do this, specify the
.Ar format,
.Ar name,
and
.Ar size
parameters in the same manner as the triplet description for the
.Sy partitionDisk
verb.
.Pp
You can specify a
.Ar size
of zero
.Sy (0)
to grow the targeted APFS Physical Store such that
all remaining space is filled to the next partition or the end of the partition map.

Ownership of the affected disks is required, and all APFS Volumes on the Container must be unlocked.

Add a new APFS Volume to an existing APFS Container. Files can then be stored on this newly-created APFS Volume.
.Pp
The

parameter sets the permanent APFS personality for this new APFS Volume; you should specify
.Sy APFS
or
.Sy Case-sensitive APFS.
.Pp
The new APFS Volume will be unencrypted unless you specify one of the passphrase options, in which case the
volume will be encrypted from the beginning of its existence (as opposed to having encryption applied later);
the user which is added will be the "Disk User".
The optional
.Ar passphraseHint
is a user-defined string that can be displayed even while an encrypted APFS Volume is locked.
.Pp
APFS Volumes have no fixed size; they allocate backing store on an as-needed basis.
You can specify the
.Ar reserve
parameter to guarantee a minimum amount of space for your volume; at least that many bytes will be available for file data.
You can also specify the
.Ar quota
parameter to limit your volume's file usage to a maximum amount; no more than that many bytes will be available for file data,
even if there is otherwise enough space in the parent APFS Container.
You can specify both
.Ar reserve
and
.Ar quota
simultaneously; however, the reserve is not allowed to be larger than the quota.
.Pp
APFS Volumes can be tagged with certain role metadata flags; you can supply the
.Ar roles
parameter with any combination of one or more of the characters
.Sy BRVITSDUNEXHLCYG,
or
.Sy 0
as a no-op for scripting convenience; the meaning of these characters is, respectively:
B=Preboot (boot loader), R=Recovery, V=VM (swap space), I=Installer (temporary usage), T=Backup (Time Machine), S=System, D=Data, U=User, N=Baseband, E=Update, X=XART (hardware security), H=Hardware, L=Internal, C=Sidecar (Time Machine), Y=Enterprise (data), and G=iDiagnostics (EFI).
Note that you may be limited to only one role at a time and various other rules.
.Pp
If you specify
.Sy -groupWith ,
your new APFS Volume will become a member of the same APFS Volume Group as the APFS Volume
.Ar groupDevice .
If
.Ar groupDevice
is not yet associated with any group, such will be created automatically when appropriate.
.Pp
The new APFS Volume is explicitly mounted after creation; you can specify
.Sy -nomount
to leave it unmounted, or, you can supply a "custom"
.Ar mountpoint
path, in which case you must be root, the directory must already exist,
and you must delete the directory yourself when you unmount.

This command will normally mount the APFS Volume after unlocking; if part of a Volume Group "System"/"Data"-role pair, both will be mounted.
If (one of the) volume(s) is of the "System"-role,
then it will be mounted as read-only unless you specify the
.Sy -systemreadwrite
option.
You can skip the explicit mounting step with the
.Sy -nomount
option, or specify a "custom" mountpoint with the
.Sy -mountpoint
option. If you specify your own mountpoint path, it must exist and you must have write privileges on it
(e.g. usually you must be root).
.Pp
Specifying
.Sy -verify

Cryptographic User UUID and usage "type".
.Pp
The usual purpose of an APFS Cryptographic User is to authenticate
for unlocking its APFS Volume; any of its users can do so.
.Pp
An APFS Volume need not be encrypted in order to contain crypto users;
indeed, other than the Disk User, they should be added before encrypting.
.Pp
Types of Cryptographic Users include at-most-one-per-Volume "Disk" user, whose UUID value always matches its Volume's UUID;
iCloud or personal "Recovery Keys", which are not users per se, but instead store partial crypto keys and are associated with
corresponding "Recovery Users" and have fixed-constant UUID values;
and "Open Directory" users, whose UUID values match corresponding local macOS Open Directory account user GUIDs.

.br
Start encryption of a currently-unencrypted APFS Volume ("Enable FileVault").
Depending on hardware, the operation may be accomplished immediately, or it may proceed "in the background".
.Pp
You can supply an existing cryptographic user UUID, in which case you must supply its corresponding passphrase,
or you can supply

.Pp
Alternatively, if no users exist yet on this APFS Volume, you can still supply
.Sy disk

This is the only way using
.Sy diskutil

.br
Start decryption of a currently-encrypted APFS Volume ("Disable FileVault").
Depending on hardware, the operation may be accomplished immediately, or it may proceed "in the background".
.Pp
The APFS Volume must be in an unlocked state before invoking this operation. Additionally,
this operation itself requires that you authenticate.
.Pp
Any existing cryptographic user and its passphrase on the APFS Volume can be supplied, using
.Sy -user
with either a UUID or the word
.Sy disk
to specify the "Disk User". If a "Disk User" exists on the APFS Volume and you omit the
.Sy -user
parameter, then the "Disk User" is assumed.
.Pp
As an alternative to a passphrase, you can specify
.Sy -recoverykeychain
with a full path, in the same fashion as the
.Sy unlockVolume

Examine the given APFS Volume's cryptographic user (unlock) records, correlating against
matching macOS user metadata (e.g. avatar pictures, password hints, etc) and use
this information to update the target volume's associated Preboot Volume. The Preboot Volume
is used at EFI firmware time to present a login user interface and to load and boot macOS.
.Pp
MacOS user metadata is sourced from macOS and Open Directory (OD) database files that
are searched for on the given
.Ar volumeDevice ,
which is normally expected to be a macOS installation.
.Pp
You can use a different Open Directory
database by supplying the
.Sy -od
option with a full path, e.g.
"/Volumes/SomeOtherMacOSVolume/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default", or with
.Sy /
to use the currently-running macOS (even if
.Ar volumeDevice
is not). Redirecting the database source can lead to loss of
access; it must never be done unless you have a precise reason.
.Pp
If some user cannot log in or login metadata is out of date,
.Sy diskutil apfs updatePreboot /
can be used as a repair.
.Pp
You should normally never have to use this verb; the Preboot Volume is updated
automatically when you use Users & Groups in System Preferences.

.br
AppleRAID verbs can be used to create, manipulate and destroy AppleRAID volumes (Software RAID).
AppleRAID supports three basic types of RAID sets:
.\" List-Begin-AppleRAIDSetTypes
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
"stripe" - Striped Volume (RAID 0)
.It
"mirror" - Mirrored Volume (RAID 1) 
.It
"concat" - Concatenated Volume (Spanning)
.\" List-End-AppleRAIDSetTypes
.El
.Pp
Of these three basic types, only the "mirror" type increases fault-tolerance.
Mirrors may have more than two disks to further increase their fault-tolerance.
Striped and concatentated volumes are, in fact, more vulnerable to faults than single disk volumes.
.Pp
From these basic types, "stacked" or "nested" RAID volumes can be created.
Stacked RAID sets that make use of mirrored RAID sets are fault-tolerant.
For example, these are some of the more common combinations of stacked RAID sets:
.\" List-Begin-StackedRAIDLevels
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
RAID 50 - A striped RAID set of hardware RAID 5 disks.
.It
RAID 10 - A striped RAID set of mirrored RAID sets.
.It
RAID 0+1 - A mirrored RAID set of striped RAID sets.
.It
Concatenated Mirror - A concatenation of mirrored RAID sets.
.\" List-End-StackedRAIDLevels
.El
.Pp
When creating new RAID sets or adding disks, if possible, it is better to specify the entire disk instead of a partition on that disk.
This allows the software to reformat the entire disk using the most current partition layouts.
When using whole disks, the type of partitioning used is selected based on the platform type (PPC = APMFormat, Intel = GPTFormat).
GPT and APM partition formats cannot be mixed in the same RAID set.
.Pp
In addition to whole disk and partition device names, AppleRAID uses UUIDs to refer to existing RAID sets and their members.
Existing RAID sets may also be specified by mount point (e.g.
.Pa /Volume/raidset Ns ).
In many cases, using the UUID for the device argument is preferred because disk device names may 
change over time when disks are added, disks are removed or when the system is rebooted.
If RAID members have been physically disconnected from the system or are no longer responding, 
you must use the member's UUID as the command argument.
Messages in the system log will refer to RAID sets and their member disks by UUID.
For more information on specifying device arguments, see the
.Sy DEVICES
section below.
.Pp
AppleRAID is not a replacement for backing up your data.
Backups should be always be performed on a regular basis and before modifying any RAID set using these commands.

CoreStorage verbs can be used to gather information about, and to remove, CoreStorage volumes.
.Pp
CoreStorage maintains a world of virtual disks, somewhat like RAID, in which one can easily add or remove imported
backing store disks, as well as exported usable volumes, to or from a pool (or several pools). This provides the user
with flexibility in allocating their hardware; user or operating system data can span multiple physical disks seamlessly,
for example.
.Pp
CoreStorage is deprecated in favor of Apple APFS.
.Pp
Apple CoreStorage defines four types of objects, instances of which are uniquely represented by a UUID:
.\" List-Begin-CoreStorageObjects

Logical Volume Group (LVG)
.It
Physical Volume (PV)
.It
Logical Volume Family (LVF)
.It
Logical Volume (LV)
.\" List-End-CoreStorageObjects
.El
.Pp
The Logical Volume Group (LVG) is the top or "pool" level; zero or more may exist during any OS boot time session.
.Pp
An LVG imports one or more Physical Volumes (PVs). A PV represents a device that feeds the LVG storage space;
a PV is normally real media but it can be a disk image or even an AppleRAID Set. A disk offered to be a PV must be a
partition and the encompassing scheme must be GPT.
.Pp
An LVG exports zero or more Logical Volume Families (LVFs). An LVF contains properties which govern and bind
together all of its descendant Logical Volumes (LVs). These properties provide settings for Full Disk Encryption (FDE)
(such as whether the LVs are encrypted, which users have access, etc) and other services.
However, at the present time, for the creation of any new LVFs, only zero or one LVF per LVG is supported.
.Pp
A Logical Volume Family (LVF) exports one or more Logical Volumes (LVs).
However, only and exactly one LV per LVF is supported.
.Pp
A Logical Volume (LV) exports a dev node, upon which a file system (such as Journaled HFS+) resides.

Unlock a logical volume and file system, causing it to be attached and mounted.
Data is then accessible in plain form to the file system and applications,
while the on-physical-disk backing bytes remain in encrypted form.
A credential must be supplied; you must supply either a "Disk" user passphrase
or a recovery keychain file.
.Pp
If no
.Sy -passphrase
option is specified, you will be prompted interactively; else, your
.Ar passphrase
is used. Or, if you specify
.Sy -stdinpassphrase
then the standard input is read (e.g. so that the passphrase can be securely
piped in without having to expose it).
.Pp
Alternatively, you can specify
.Sy -recoverykeychain
with a path to a keychain
.Ar file .
The keychain must be unlocked; see
.Ns Xr security 1 
for more information.
.Pp
The locked state means that the CoreStorage driver has not been given authentication
information (a passphrase) to interpret the encrypted bytes on disk and thus export a dev node.
This verb unlocks a logical volume family (LVF) and its logical volumes (LVs) by providing that
authentication; as the LVs thus appear as dev nodes,
any file systems upon them are automatically mounted unless the
.Sy -nomount
option is given.
.Pp
To re-lock the volume, make it offline again by ejecting it, e.g. with

.Pa U
is the device unit.
It may refer to hardware (e.g. a hard drive, optical drive, or memory card) or a virtual "drive"
constructed by software (e.g. an AppleRAID Set, Apple Disk Image, CoreStorage LV, etc).
.It
.Pa C
is an APFS Container.
This is a virtual disk constructed by APFS to represent a collection of APFS Volumes.
Multiple APFS Containers can be active simultaneously.
.It
.Pa Q
is the session and is only included for optical media; it refers to the number of times recording has taken
place on the currently-inserted medium (disc).
.It
.Pa P
is a partition in some partitioning scheme. A partitioning scheme divides up a device unit and is also called
a "partition map" or simply a "map".
Upon a partition, the raw data that underlies a user-visible file system is
usually present, but it may also contain specialized data for certain 3rd-party database programs, or data required for
the system software (e.g. EFI partitions, booter partitions, APM partition map data, etc), or, notably, it might contain
backing-store physical volumes for AppleRAID, CoreStorage, APFS, or other (3rd-party) Storage Systems.
For example, a partition disk0s2 might contain APFS data and have a partition type of Apple_APFS;
this partition would then be termed an APFS Physical Store, out of which an APFS Container disk1 is defined,
out of which an APFS Volume disk1s1 is exported.

is an APFS Volume; it refers to a virtual logical volume that is shared out of an APFS Container.
For example, exported from an APFS Container designated as disk1 there might be an APFS Volume disk1s1,
mountable as a file system and usable for file storage via its mountpoint path.
.It
.Pa S
is an APFS Snapshot; it refers to a frozen moment in time of the state of files on an APFS Volume.
For example, if APFS Container disk6 has an APFS Volume disk6s3, and two APFS Snapshots have been "taken" on it,
these, when mounted, might be designated as disk6s3s1 and disk6s3s2. Zero or more snapshots can be
persistently defined on a volume, but only "active" (mounted) snapshots have disk identifiers.

Some units (e.g. floppy disks, RAID sets) contain file system data upon their "whole" device instead of containing
a partitioning scheme with partitions.
.Pp
Note that some of the forms appear the same and must be distinguished by context.
For example,
.Pa diskUsQ ,
.Pa diskUsS ,
and
.Pa diskCsV
are all 2-part forms that can mean different things: For non-optical media, it identifies a partition (on a partition map) upon
which (file system) data is stored; for optical media, it identifies a session upon which an entire partition map (with its
partitions with file systems) is stored; for an APFS setup, it identifies an APFS Volume. As another example,
in "stacked" cases (CoreStorage on AppleRAID or APFS on AppleRAID), the 1-part
.Pa diskU
form becomes a CoreStorage PV or APFS PhysicalStore, in contrast with the more-common 2-part form.
.Pp
It is important for software to avoid relying on numerical ordering of any of the parts.
Activities including but not limited to partition deletions and insertions, partition resizing, virtual volume deletions and additions,
device ejects and attachments due to media insertion cycles, plug cycles, authentication lock cycles or reboots, can all cause (temporary)
gaps and non-increments in the numerical ordering of any of the parts. You must rely on more persistent means of identification, such
as the various UUIDs.

.Sh SIZES
Wherever a size is emitted as an
.Sy output ,
it is presented as a base-ten approximation to the precision of one fractional decimal
digit and a base-ten SI multiplier, often accompanied by a precise count in bytes. Scripts should refrain from parsing this
human-readable output and use the
.Sy -plist
option instead.
.Pp
Wherever a
.Ar size
is to be supplied by you as an
.Sy input ,
you can provide values in a number of different ways, some absolute and some context-sensitive.
Values are interpreted as base ten and must be positive with no preceding "+".
An integer without a suffix is taken to mean an exact number of bytes (e.g. 5368709120).
Multiplier suffixes are optional, must follow your value immediately without whitespace, and allow your value
to be a real number (e.g. 5.1234t).
Some of the specifiers below should not have a preceding value at all (e.g. the letter
.Sy R
for "remainder").

In certain contexts (e.g. when asking to "use all space available", or when building partition triplets)
you can provide a relative value as follows:
.\" List-Begin-SizeSuffixes-4
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
.Sy 0
(the number zero) is a request to allocate "all possible". This may mean different things in different contexts.
For partition maps, this requests allocation until the start of the following partition or the end of the partition map's allocatable space.
.It
.Sy %
(with a preceding number) is a
.Sy percentage
of the whole-disk size, the partition map size, or other allocatable size, as appropriate by context.
Use of
.Sy %
is not supported in all situations.
.It
.Sy R
(with no preceding number) specifies the
.Sy remainder
of the whole-disk size or other allocatable size after all other triplets in the group are taken into account.
It need not be in the last triplet.  It must only appear in at most one triplet among all triplets.
Use of
.Sy R
is not supported in all situations; in some such cases, a value of
.Sy 0
is more appropriate.

You can provide an operating system-defined constant value as follows:

Note again that
.Sy B
refers to bytes and
.Sy S
and
.Sy UAM
refer to a constant multiplier of 512; the latter are useful when working with tools such as
.Sy gpt
(8) or
.Sy df
(1).  Note also that this multiplier is not a "block" size as actually implemented by the
underlying device driver and/or hardware, nor is it an "allocation block", which is a
file system's minimum unit of backing store usage, often formatting-option-dependent.
.Pp
Examples: 10G (10 gigabytes), 4.23tb (4.23 terabytes), 5M (5 megabytes), 4GiB (exactly 2^32 bytes),
126000 (exactly 126000 bytes), 25.4% (25.4 percent of whole disk size).
.Sh FORMAT
The
.Pa format
parameter for the erasing and partitioning verbs is the file system personality name.
You can determine this name by looking in a file system bundle's
.Pa /System/Library/Filesystems/<fs>.fs/Contents/Info.plist
and looking at the keys for the
.Sy FSPersonalities
dictionary, or by using the
.Sy listFilesystems
verb, which also lists shortcut aliases for common
personalities (these shortcuts are defined by
.Sy diskutil
for use with it only).
.Pp
Common examples include JHFS+, JHFSX, MS-DOS, etc, as nicknames for the canonical
forms from the file system bundles such as "Case-sensitive HFS+".

.Sh HISTORY
The eraseDisk and partitionDisk verbs had an option to add Mac OS 9 drivers (in partitions designated for that purpose);
there was also a repairOS9Permissions verb.
These have been removed.
.Pp
Starting with Mac OS X 10.6, the input and output notation of disk and partition sizes use power-of-10 suffixes.
In the past this had been power-of-2, regardless of the suffix (e.g. G, Gi, GiB) used for display or accepted as input.
Starting with Mac OS X 10.11, the
.Sy B
suffix is optional even for "bare" numeric values.
.Pp
Starting with Mac OS X 10.11, the verify- and repairPermissions verbs have been removed.
.Pp
Starting with macOS 10.12, the plist output of partitions from
.Sy diskutil list -plist
is presented in on-disk (not BSD slice name, e.g. disk0s2) order. This
mimics the order of outputs from programs such as
.Sy gpt
(1). The human-readable output always has been, and remains, in on-disk order.
.Pp
Starting with macOS 10.13.2, APFS cryptographic user authentication is
required even when disabling FileVault.
.Pp
Starting with macOS 10.14, partitions on all media above 1GiB in size will default to 1MiB alignment,
regardless of the partitioning scheme. This is significant for MBR partition maps and their use in
appliances such as cameras. Free-space requests will not be aligned.
.Pp
Starting with macOS 11.0, certain Core Storage manipulation verbs have been removed.

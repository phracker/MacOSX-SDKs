File::Find::Rule went down so well with the buying public that
everyone wanted to add extra features.  With the 0.07 release this
became a possibility, using the following conventions.

Yes, we're being very cavalier here and defining things into the main
File::Find::Rule namespace.  This is due to lack of imaginiation on my
part \- I simply can't find a way for the functional and oo interface
to work without doing this or some kind of inheritance, and
inheritance stops you using two File::Find::Rule::Foo modules
together.
.PP
For this reason try and pick distinct names for your extensions.  If
this becomes a problem then I may institute a semi-official registry
of taken names.
.SS "Taking no arguments."
.IX Subsection "Taking no arguments."
Note the null prototype on random.  This is a cheat for the procedural
interface to know that your sub takes no arguments, and so allows this
to happen:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& find( random => in => \*(Aq.\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
If you hadn't declared \f(CW\*(C`random\*(C'\fR with a null prototype it would have
consumed \f(CW\*(C`in\*(C'\fR as a parameter to it, then got all confused as it
doesn't know about a \f(CW\*(Aq.\*(Aq\fR rule.

File::Find::Rule::MMagic was the first extension module, so maybe
check that out.

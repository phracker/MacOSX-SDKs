.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Despite its name, the \f(CW\*(C`PPI::Statement::Include\*(C'\fR class covers a number
of different types of statement that cover all statements starting with
\&\f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR.
.PP
But basically, they cover three situations.
.PP
Firstly, a dependency on a particular version of perl (for which the
\&\f(CW\*(C`version\*(C'\fR method returns true), a pragma (for which the \f(CW\*(C`pragma\*(C'\fR method
returns true), or the loading (and unloading via no) of modules.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`PPI::Statement::Include\*(C'\fR has a number of methods in addition to the standard
PPI::Statement, PPI::Node and PPI::Element methods.
.SS "type"
.IX Subsection "type"
The \f(CW\*(C`type\*(C'\fR method returns the general type of statement (\f(CW\*(Aquse\*(Aq\fR, \f(CW\*(Aqno\*(Aq\fR
or \f(CW\*(Aqrequire\*(Aq\fR).
.PP
Returns the type as a string, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the type cannot be detected.
.SS "module"
.IX Subsection "module"
The \f(CW\*(C`module\*(C'\fR method returns the module name specified in any include
statement. This \f(CW\*(C`includes\*(C'\fR pragma names, because pragma are implemented
as modules. (And lets face it, the definition of a pragma can be fuzzy
at the best of times in any case)
.PP
This covers all of these...
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  use strict;
\&  use My::Module;
\&  no strict;
\&  require My::Module;
.Ve
.PP
\&...but does not cover any of these...
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  use 5.006;
\&  require 5.005;
\&  require "explicit/file/name.pl";
.Ve
.PP
Returns the module name as a string, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the include does
not specify a module name.
.SS "module_version"
.IX Subsection "module_version"
The \f(CW\*(C`module_version\*(C'\fR method returns the minimum version of the module
required by the statement, if there is one.
.SS "pragma"
.IX Subsection "pragma"
The \f(CW\*(C`pragma\*(C'\fR method checks for an include statement's use as a
pragma, and returns it if so.
.PP
Or at least, it claims to. In practice it's a lot harder to say exactly
what is or isn't a pragma, because the definition is fuzzy.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`intent\*(C'\fR of a pragma is to modify the way in which the parser works.
This is done though the use of modules that do various types of internals
magic.
.PP
For now, \s-1PPI\s0 assumes that any \*(L"module name\*(R" that is only a set of
lowercase letters (and perhaps numbers, like \f(CW\*(C`use utf8;\*(C'\fR). This
behaviour is expected to change, most likely to something that knows
the specific names of the various \*(L"pragmas\*(R".
.PP
Returns the name of the pragma, or false ('') if the include is not a
pragma.
.SS "version"
.IX Subsection "version"
The \f(CW\*(C`version\*(C'\fR method checks for an include statement that introduces a
dependency on the version of \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR the code is compatible with.
.PP
This covers two specific statements.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use 5.006;
\&  require 5.006;
.Ve
.PP
Currently the version is returned as a string, although in future the version
may be returned as a version object.  If you want a numeric representation,
use \f(CW\*(C`version_literal()\*(C'\fR.  Returns false if the statement is not a version
dependency.
.SS "version_literal"
.IX Subsection "version_literal"
The \f(CW\*(C`version_literal\*(C'\fR method has the same behavior as \f(CW\*(C`version()\*(C'\fR, but the
version is returned as a numeric literal.  Returns false if the statement is
not a version dependency.
.SS "arguments"
.IX Subsection "arguments"
The \f(CW\*(C`arguments\*(C'\fR method gives you the rest of the statement after the
module/pragma and module version, i.e. the stuff that will be used to
construct what gets passed to the module's \f(CW\*(C`import()\*(C'\fR subroutine.  This does
include the comma, etc. operators, but doesn't include non-significant direct
children or any final semicolon.

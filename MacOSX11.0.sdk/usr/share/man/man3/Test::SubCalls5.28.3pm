.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
There are a number of different situations (like testing caching code)
where you want to want to do a number of tests, and then verify that
some underlying subroutine deep within the code was called a specific
number of times.
.PP
This module provides a number of functions for doing testing in this way
in association with your normal Test::More (or similar) test scripts.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
In the nature of test modules, all functions are exported by default.
.ie n .SS "sub_track $subname"
.el .SS "sub_track \f(CW$subname\fP"
.IX Subsection "sub_track $subname"
The \f(CW\*(C`sub_track\*(C'\fR function creates a new call tracker for a named function.
.PP
The sub to track must be provided by name, references to the function
itself are insufficient.
.PP
Returns true if added, or dies on error.
.ie n .SS "sub_calls $subname, $expected_calls [, $message ]"
.el .SS "sub_calls \f(CW$subname\fP, \f(CW$expected_calls\fP [, \f(CW$message\fP ]"
.IX Subsection "sub_calls $subname, $expected_calls [, $message ]"
The \f(CW\*(C`sub_calls\*(C'\fR function is the primary (and only) testing function
provided by \f(CW\*(C`Test::SubCalls\*(C'\fR. A single call will represent one test in
your plan.
.PP
It takes the subroutine name as originally provided to \f(CW\*(C`sub_track\*(C'\fR,
the expected number of times the subroutine should have been called,
and an optional test message.
.PP
If no message is provided, a default message will be provided for you.
.PP
Test is ok if the number of times the sub has been called matches the
expected number, or not ok if not.
.ie n .SS "sub_reset $subname"
.el .SS "sub_reset \f(CW$subname\fP"
.IX Subsection "sub_reset $subname"
To prevent repeat users from having to take before and after counts when
they start testing from after zero, the \f(CW\*(C`sub_reset\*(C'\fR function has been
provided to reset a sub call counter to zero.
.PP
Returns true or dies if the sub name is invalid or not currently tracked.
.SS "sub_reset_all"
.IX Subsection "sub_reset_all"
Provided mainly as a convenience, the \f(CW\*(C`sub_reset_all\*(C'\fR function will reset
all the counters currently defined.
.PP
Returns true.

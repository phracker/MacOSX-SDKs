.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
If you've read PPI::Token::Whitespace, you should understand by now
the concept of documents \*(L"floating in a sea of PPI::Token::Whitespace\*(R".
.PP
Well it doesn't after the _\|_END_\|_ tag.
.PP
Once you _\|_END_\|_, it's all over. Anything after that tag isn't even fit
to be called whitespace. It just simply doesn't exist as far as perl
(the interpreter) is concerned.
.PP
That's not to say there isn't useful content. Most often people use
the _\|_END_\|_ tag to hide \s-1POD\s0 content, so that perl never has to see it,
and presumably providing some small speed up.
.PP
That's fine. \s-1PPI\s0 likes \s-1POD.\s0 Any \s-1POD\s0 after the _\|_END_\|_ tag is parsed
into valid PPI::Token::Pod tags as normal. \fBThis\fR class, on the
other hand, is for \*(L"what's after _\|_END_\|_ when it isn't \s-1POD\*(R".\s0
.PP
Basically, the completely worthless bits of the file :)

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
LWP::Authen::Ntlm allows \s-1LWP\s0 to authenticate against servers that are using the
\&\s-1NTLM\s0 authentication scheme popularized by Microsoft.  This type of authentication is
common on intranets of Microsoft-centric organizations.
.PP
The module takes advantage of the Authen::NTLM module by Mark Bush.  Since there
is also another Authen::NTLM module available from \s-1CPAN\s0 by Yee Man Chan with an
entirely different interface, it is necessary to ensure that you have the correct
\&\s-1NTLM\s0 module.
.PP
In addition, there have been problems with incompatibilities between different
versions of Mime::Base64, which Bush's Authen::NTLM makes use of.  Therefore, it is
necessary to ensure that your Mime::Base64 module supports exporting of the
encode_base64 and decode_base64 functions.
.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
The module is used indirectly through \s-1LWP,\s0 rather than including it directly in your
code.  The \s-1LWP\s0 system will invoke the \s-1NTLM\s0 authentication when it encounters the
authentication scheme while attempting to retrieve a \s-1URL\s0 from a server.  In order
for the \s-1NTLM\s0 authentication to work, you must have a few things set up in your
code prior to attempting to retrieve the \s-1URL:\s0
.IP "\(bu" 4
Enable persistent \s-1HTTP\s0 connections
.Sp
To do this, pass the \*(L"keep_alive=>1\*(R" option to the LWP::UserAgent when creating it, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent\->new(keep_alive=>1);
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Set the credentials on the UserAgent object
.Sp
The credentials must be set like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   $ua\->credentials(\*(Aqwww.company.com:80\*(Aq, \*(Aq\*(Aq, "MyDomain\e\eMyUserCode", \*(AqMyPassword\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
Note that you cannot use the HTTP::Request object's \fBauthorization_basic()\fR method to set
the credentials.  Note, too, that the 'www.company.com:80' portion only sets credentials
on the specified port \s-1AND\s0 it is case-sensitive (this is due to the way \s-1LWP\s0 is coded, and
has nothing to do with LWP::Authen::Ntlm)
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.IX Header "AVAILABILITY"
General queries regarding \s-1LWP\s0 should be made to the \s-1LWP\s0 Mailing List.

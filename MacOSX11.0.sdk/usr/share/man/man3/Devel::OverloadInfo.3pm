Devel::OverloadInfo \- introspect overloaded operators
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 0.005
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Devel::OverloadInfo returns information about overloaded
operators for a given class (or object), including where in the
inheritance hierarchy the overloads are declared and where the code
implementing them is.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
.SS "is_overloaded"
.IX Subsection "is_overloaded"
.Vb 1
\&   if (is_overloaded($class_or_object)) { ... }
.Ve
.PP
Returns a boolean indicating whether the given class or object has any
overloading declared.  Note that a bare \f(CW\*(C`use overload;\*(C'\fR with no
actual operators counts as being overloaded.
.PP
Equivalent to
\&\fBoverload::Overloaded()\fR, but
doesn't trigger various bugs associated with it in versions of perl
before 5.16.
.SS "overload_op_info"
.IX Subsection "overload_op_info"
.Vb 1
\&    my $info = overload_op_info($class_or_object, $op);
.Ve
.PP
Returns a hash reference with information about the specified
overloaded operator of the named class or blessed object.
.PP
Returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the operator is not overloaded.
.PP
See \*(L"Overloadable Operations\*(R" in overload for the available operators.
.PP
The keys in the returned hash are as follows:
.IP "class" 4
.IX Item "class"
The name of the class in which the operator overloading was declared.
.IP "code" 4
.IX Item "code"
A reference to the function implementing the overloaded operator.
.IP "code_name" 4
.IX Item "code_name"
The name of the function implementing the overloaded operator, as
returned by \f(CW\*(C`sub_fullname\*(C'\fR in Sub::Identify.
.IP "method_name (optional)" 4
.IX Item "method_name (optional)"
The name of the method implementing the overloaded operator, if the
overloading was specified as a named method, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`use overload $op
=> \*(Aqmethod\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR.
.IP "code_class (optional)" 4
.IX Item "code_class (optional)"
The name of the class in which the method specified by \f(CW\*(C`method_name\*(C'\fR
was found.
.IP "value (optional)" 4
.IX Item "value (optional)"
For the special \f(CW\*(C`fallback\*(C'\fR key, the value it was given in \f(CW\*(C`class\*(C'\fR.
.SS "overload_info"
.IX Subsection "overload_info"
.Vb 1
\&    my $info = overload_info($class_or_object);
.Ve
.PP
Returns a hash reference with information about all the overloaded
operators of specified class name or blessed object.  The keys are the
overloaded operators, as specified in \f(CW%overload::ops\fR (see
\&\*(L"Overloadable Operations\*(R" in overload), and the values are the hashes
returned by \*(L"overload_op_info\*(R".
.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
Whether the \f(CW\*(C`fallback\*(C'\fR key exists when it has its default value of
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR varies between perl versions: Before 5.18 it's there, in
later versions it's not.

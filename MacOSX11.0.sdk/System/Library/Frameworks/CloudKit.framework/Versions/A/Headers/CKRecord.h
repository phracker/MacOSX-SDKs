 *
 *  The share property on a record will be removed when the corresponding CKShare is deleted from the server. Send this record in the same batch as the share delete and this record's share property will be updated.
 *
 *  Sharing is only supported in zones with the @c CKRecordZoneCapabilitySharing capability. The default zone does not support sharing.
 *
 *  If any records have a parent reference to this record, they are implicitly shared alongside this record.
 *
 *  Note that records in a parent chain must only exist within one share. If a child record already has a share reference set then you will get a @c CKErrorAlreadyShared error if you try to share any of that record's parents.
 *
 *  Child records can be shared independently, even if they have a common parent.  For example:
 *  Record A has two child records, Record B and Record C.
 *      A
 *     / \
 *    B   C
 *
 *  These configurations are supported:
 *  - Record A part of Share 1, or
 *  - Record B part of Share 1, or
 *  - Record C part of Share 1, or
 *  - Record B part of Share 1, Record C part of Share 2
 *
 *  These configurations are not supported:
 *  Record A part of Share 1, Record B part of Share 2, or
 *    -- This is not allowed because Record B would then be in two shares; Share 1 by being Record A's child, and Share 2
 *  Record A part of Share 1, Record C part of Share 2, or
 *    -- This is not allowed because Record C would then be in two shares; Share 1 by being Record A's child, and Share 2
 *  Record A part of Share 1, Record B part of Share 2, Record C part of Share 3
 *    -- This is not allowed because both Record B and Record C would then each be in two shares.
 *
 *  Whenever possible, it is suggested that you construct your parent hierarchies such that you will only need to share the topmost record of that hierarchy.

 *
 *  A parent record reference must have @c CKReferenceActionNone set. You can create a separate reference with @c CKReferenceActionDeleteSelf if you would like your hierarchy cleaned up when the parent record is deleted.
 *
 *  The target of a parent reference must exist at save time - either already on the server, or part of the same @c CKModifyRecordsOperation batch.
 *
 *  You are encouraged to set up the @c parent relationships as part of normal record saves, even if you're not planning on sharing records at this time.
 *  This allows you to share and unshare a hierarchy of records at a later date by only modifying the "top level" record, setting or clearing its @c share reference.

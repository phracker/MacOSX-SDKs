.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Config module contains all the information that was available to
the \f(CW\*(C`Configure\*(C'\fR program at Perl build time (over 900 values).
.PP
Shell variables from the \fIconfig.sh\fR file (written by Configure) are
stored in the readonly-variable \f(CW%Config\fR, indexed by their names.
.PP
Values stored in config.sh as 'undef' are returned as undefined
values.  The perl \f(CW\*(C`exists\*(C'\fR function can be used to check if a
named variable exists.
.PP
For a description of the variables, please have a look at the
Glossary file, as written in the Porting folder, or use the url:
https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/blead/Porting/Glossary
.IP "\fBmyconfig()\fR" 4
.IX Item "myconfig()"
Returns a textual summary of the major perl configuration values.
See also \f(CW\*(C`\-V\*(C'\fR in \*(L"Command Switches\*(R" in perlrun.
.IP "\fBconfig_sh()\fR" 4
.IX Item "config_sh()"
Returns the entire perl configuration information in the form of the
original config.sh shell variable assignment script.
.IP "config_re($regex)" 4
.IX Item "config_re($regex)"
Like \fBconfig_sh()\fR but returns, as a list, only the config entries who's
names match the \f(CW$regex\fR.
.IP "config_vars(@names)" 4
.IX Item "config_vars(@names)"
Prints to \s-1STDOUT\s0 the values of the named configuration variable. Each is
printed on a separate line in the form:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  name=\*(Aqvalue\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
Names which are unknown are output as \f(CW\*(C`name=\*(AqUNKNOWN\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR.
See also \f(CW\*(C`\-V:name\*(C'\fR in \*(L"Command Switches\*(R" in perlrun.
.IP "\fBbincompat_options()\fR" 4
.IX Item "bincompat_options()"
Returns a list of C pre-processor options used when compiling this \fIperl\fR
binary, which affect its binary compatibility with extensions.
\&\f(CW\*(C`bincompat_options()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`non_bincompat_options()\*(C'\fR are shown together in
the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR as \fICompile-time options\fR.
.IP "\fBnon_bincompat_options()\fR" 4
.IX Item "non_bincompat_options()"
Returns a list of C pre-processor options used when compiling this \fIperl\fR
binary, which do not affect binary compatibility with extensions.
.IP "\fBcompile_date()\fR" 4
.IX Item "compile_date()"
Returns the compile date (as a string), equivalent to what is shown by
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fBlocal_patches()\fR" 4
.IX Item "local_patches()"
Returns a list of the names of locally applied patches, equivalent to what
is shown by \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBheader_files()\fR" 4
.IX Item "header_files()"
Returns a list of the header files that should be used as dependencies for
\&\s-1XS\s0 code, for this version of Perl on this platform.

.SH "WARNING"
.IX Header "WARNING"
Because this information is not stored within the perl executable
itself it is possible (but unlikely) that the information does not
relate to the actual perl binary which is being used to access it.
.PP
The Config module is installed into the architecture and version
specific library directory ($Config{installarchlib}) and it checks the
perl version number when loaded.
.PP
The values stored in config.sh may be either single-quoted or
double-quoted. Double-quoted strings are handy for those cases where you
need to include escape sequences in the strings. To avoid runtime variable
interpolation, any \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR characters are replaced by \f(CW\*(C`\e$\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e@\*(C'\fR, respectively. This isn't foolproof, of course, so don't embed \f(CW\*(C`\e$\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`\e@\*(C'\fR in double-quoted strings unless you're willing to deal with the
consequences. (The slashes will end up escaped and the \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR will
trigger variable interpolation)
.SH "GLOSSARY"
.IX Header "GLOSSARY"
Most \f(CW\*(C`Config\*(C'\fR variables are determined by the \f(CW\*(C`Configure\*(C'\fR script
on platforms supported by it (which is most \s-1UNIX\s0 platforms).  Some
platforms have custom-made \f(CW\*(C`Config\*(C'\fR variables, and may thus not have
some of the variables described below, or may have extraneous variables
specific to that particular port.  See the port specific documentation
in such cases.

.ie n .IP """afs""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWafs\fR" 4
.IX Item "afs"
From \fIafs.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is set to \f(CW\*(C`true\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`AFS\*(C'\fR (Andrew File System) is used
on the system, \f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR otherwise.  It is possible to override this
with a hint value or command line option, but you'd better know
what you are doing.
.ie n .IP """afsroot""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWafsroot\fR" 4
.IX Item "afsroot"
From \fIafs.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is by default set to \fI/afs\fR. In the unlikely case
this is not the correct root, it is possible to override this with
a hint value or command line option.  This will be used in subsequent
tests for AFSness in the configure and test process.
.ie n .IP """alignbytes""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWalignbytes\fR" 4
.IX Item "alignbytes"
From \fIalignbytes.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable holds the number of bytes required to align a
double\*(-- or a long double when applicable. Usual values are
2, 4 and 8.  The default is eight, for safety.
.ie n .IP """aphostname""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWaphostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "aphostname"
From \fId_gethname.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable contains the command which can be used to compute the
host name. The command is fully qualified by its absolute path, to make
it safe when used by a process with super-user privileges.
.ie n .IP """api_revision""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWapi_revision\fR" 4
.IX Item "api_revision"
From \fIpatchlevel.U\fR:
.Sp
The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
such as \fI5.6.1\fR, api_revision is the \f(CW5\fR.
Prior to 5.5.640, the format was a floating point number,
like 5.00563.
.Sp
\&\fIperl.c\fR:\fBincpush()\fR and \fIlib/lib.pm\fR will automatically search in
\&\fI\f(CI$sitelib\fI/.\fR. for older directories back to the limit specified
by these api_ variables.  This is only useful if you have a
perl library directory tree structured like the default one.
See \f(CW\*(C`INSTALL\*(C'\fR for how this works.  The versioned site_perl
directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the lowest
possible value.  The version list appropriate for the current
system is determined in \fIinc_version_list.U\fR.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`XXX\*(C'\fR To do:  Since compatibility can depend on compile time
options (such as bincompat, longlong, etc.) it should
(perhaps) be set by Configure, but currently it isn't.
Currently, we read a hard-wired value from \fIpatchlevel.h\fR.
Perhaps what we ought to do is take the hard-wired value from
\&\fIpatchlevel.h\fR but then modify it if the current Configure
options warrant.  \fIpatchlevel.h\fR then would use an #ifdef guard.
.ie n .IP """api_subversion""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWapi_subversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "api_subversion"
From \fIpatchlevel.U\fR:
.Sp
The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
such as \fI5.6.1\fR, api_subversion is the \f(CW1\fR.  See api_revision for
full details.
.ie n .IP """api_version""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWapi_version\fR" 4
.IX Item "api_version"
From \fIpatchlevel.U\fR:
.Sp
The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
such as \fI5.6.1\fR, api_version is the \f(CW6\fR.  See api_revision for
full details.  As a special case, 5.5.0 is rendered in the
old-style as 5.005.  (In the 5.005_0x maintenance series,
this was the only versioned directory in \f(CW$sitelib\fR.)
.ie n .IP """api_versionstring""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWapi_versionstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "api_versionstring"
From \fIpatchlevel.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable combines api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion in a format such as 5.6.1 (or 5_6_1) suitable
for use as a directory name.  This is filesystem dependent.
.ie n .IP """ar""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWar\fR" 4
.IX Item "ar"
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the ar program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain \f(CW\*(C`ar\*(C'\fR and is not useful.
.ie n .IP """archlib""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWarchlib\fR" 4
.IX Item "archlib"
From \fIarchlib.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
to put architecture-dependent public library files for \f(CW$package\fR.
It is most often a local directory such as \fI/usr/local/lib\fR.
Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal
with filename expansion.
.ie n .IP """archlibexp""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWarchlibexp\fR" 4
.IX Item "archlibexp"
From \fIarchlib.U\fR:

This variable is the same as the archlib variable, but is
filename expanded at configuration time, for convenient use.
.ie n .IP """archname""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWarchname\fR" 4
.IX Item "archname"
From \fIarchname.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is a short name to characterize the current
architecture.  It is used mainly to construct the default archlib.
.ie n .IP """archname64""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWarchname64\fR" 4
.IX Item "archname64"
From \fIuse64bits.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is used for the 64\-bitness part of \f(CW$archname\fR.
.ie n .IP """archobjs""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWarchobjs\fR" 4
.IX Item "archobjs"
From \fIUnix.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable defines any additional objects that must be linked
in with the program on this architecture.  On unix, it is usually
empty.  It is typically used to include emulations of unix calls
or other facilities.  For perl on \fI\s-1OS/2\s0\fR, for example, this would
include \fIos2/os2.obj\fR.
.ie n .IP """asctime_r_proto""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWasctime_r_proto\fR" 4
.IX Item "asctime_r_proto"
From \fId_asctime_r.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable encodes the prototype of asctime_r.
It is zero if d_asctime_r is undef, and one of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`REENTRANT_PROTO_T_ABC\*(C'\fR macros of \fIreentr.h\fR if d_asctime_r
is defined.
.ie n .IP """awk""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWawk\fR" 4
.IX Item "awk"
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the

This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
The value is the empty string and is not useful.
.ie n .IP """bin""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWbin\fR" 4
.IX Item "bin"
From \fIbin.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
to put publicly executable images for the package in question.  It
is most often a local directory such as \fI/usr/local/bin\fR. Programs using
this variable must be prepared to deal with \fI~name\fR substitution.
.ie n .IP """bin_ELF""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWbin_ELF\fR" 4
.IX Item "bin_ELF"
From \fIdlsrc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable saves the result from configure if generated binaries

.el .IP "\f(CWinstallstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "installstyle"
From \fIinstallstyle.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable describes the \f(CW\*(C`style\*(C'\fR of the perl installation.
This is intended to be useful for tools that need to
manipulate entire perl distributions.  Perl itself doesn't use
this to find its libraries \*(-- the library directories are
stored directly in \fIConfig.pm\fR.  Currently, there are only two
styles:  \f(CW\*(C`lib\*(C'\fR and \fIlib/perl5\fR.  The default library locations
(e.g. privlib, sitelib) are either \fI\f(CI$prefix\fI/lib\fR or
\&\fI\f(CI$prefix\fI/lib/perl5\fR.  The former is useful if \f(CW$prefix\fR is a
directory dedicated to perl (e.g. \fI/opt/perl\fR), while the latter
is useful if \f(CW$prefix\fR is shared by many packages, e.g. if
\&\f(CW$prefix\fR=\fI/usr/local\fR.
.Sp
Unfortunately, while this \f(CW\*(C`style\*(C'\fR variable is used to set
defaults for all three directory hierarchies (core, vendor, and
site), there is no guarantee that the same style is actually
appropriate for all those directories.  For example, \f(CW$prefix\fR
might be \fI/opt/perl\fR, but \f(CW$siteprefix\fR might be \fI/usr/local\fR.
(Perhaps, in retrospect, the \f(CW\*(C`lib\*(C'\fR style should never have been
supported, but it did seem like a nice idea at the time.)
.Sp
The situation is even less clear for tools such as MakeMaker
that can be used to install additional modules into
non-standard places.  For example, if a user intends to install
a module into a private directory (perhaps by setting \f(CW\*(C`PREFIX\*(C'\fR on
the \fIMakefile.PL\fR command line), then there is no reason to
assume that the Configure-time \f(CW$installstyle\fR setting will be
relevant for that \f(CW\*(C`PREFIX\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This may later be extended to include other information, so
be careful with pattern-matching on the results.
.Sp
For compatibility with \fIperl5.005\fR and earlier, the default
setting is based on whether or not \f(CW$prefix\fR contains the string
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR.

The full version number of this package, such as 5.6.1 (or 5_6_1).
This combines revision, patchlevel, and subversion to get the
full version number, including any possible subversions.
This is suitable for use as a directory name, and hence is
filesystem dependent.
.ie n .IP """version_patchlevel_string""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWversion_patchlevel_string\fR" 4
.IX Item "version_patchlevel_string"
From \fIpatchlevel.U\fR:
.Sp
This is a string combining version, subversion and
perl_patchlevel (if perl_patchlevel is non-zero).
It is typically something like
\&'version 7 subversion 1'  or
\&'version 7 subversion 1 patchlevel 11224'
It is computed here to avoid duplication of code in \fImyconfig.SH\fR
and \fIlib/Config.pm\fR.
.ie n .IP """versiononly""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWversiononly\fR" 4
.IX Item "versiononly"
From \fIversiononly.U\fR:
.Sp
If set, this symbol indicates that only the version-specific
components of a perl installation should be installed.
This may be useful for making a test installation of a new
version without disturbing the existing installation.
Setting versiononly is equivalent to setting installperl's \-v option.
In particular, the non-versioned scripts and programs such as
a2p, c2ph, h2xs, pod2*, and perldoc are not installed
(see \f(CW\*(C`INSTALL\*(C'\fR for a more complete list).  Nor are the man
pages installed.
Usually, this is undef.
.ie n .IP """vi""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWvi\fR" 4
.IX Item "vi"
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
The value is the empty string and is not useful.
.SS "x"
.IX Subsection "x"
.ie n .IP """xlibpth""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWxlibpth\fR" 4
.IX Item "xlibpth"
From \fIlibpth.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable holds extra path (space-separated) used to find
libraries on this platform, for example \f(CW\*(C`CPU\*(C'\fR\-specific libraries
(on multi\-\f(CW\*(C`CPU\*(C'\fR platforms) may be listed here.
.SS "y"
.IX Subsection "y"
.ie n .IP """yacc""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWyacc\fR" 4
.IX Item "yacc"
From \fIyacc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable holds the name of the compiler compiler we
want to use in the Makefile. It can be yacc, byacc, or bison \-y.
.ie n .IP """yaccflags""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWyaccflags\fR" 4
.IX Item "yaccflags"
From \fIyacc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable contains any additional yacc flags desired by the
user.  It is up to the Makefile to use this.
.SS "z"
.IX Subsection "z"
.ie n .IP """zcat""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWzcat\fR" 4
.IX Item "zcat"
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
The value is the empty string and is not useful.
.ie n .IP """zip""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWzip\fR" 4
.IX Item "zip"
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the zip program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain \f(CW\*(C`zip\*(C'\fR and is not useful.
.SH "GIT DATA"
.IX Header "GIT DATA"
Information on the git commit from which the current perl binary was compiled
can be found in the variable \f(CW$Config::Git_Data\fR.  The variable is a
structured string that looks something like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  git_commit_id=\*(Aqea0c2dbd5f5ac6845ecc7ec6696415bf8e27bd52\*(Aq
\&  git_describe=\*(AqGitLive\-blead\-1076\-gea0c2db\*(Aq

\&  git_commit_date=\*(Aq2009\-05\-09 17:47:31 +0200\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Its format is not guaranteed not to change over time.
.SH "NOTE"
.IX Header "NOTE"
This module contains a good example of how to use tie to implement a
cache and an example of how to make a tied variable readonly to those
outside of it.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBFile::Remove::remove\fR removes files and directories.  It acts like
\&\fB/bin/rm\fR, for the most part.  Although \f(CW\*(C`unlink\*(C'\fR can be given a list
of files, it will not remove directories; this module remedies that.
It also accepts wildcards, * and ?, as arguments for filenames.
.PP
\&\fBFile::Remove::trash\fR accepts the same arguments as \fBremove\fR, with
the addition of an optional, infrequently used \*(L"other platforms\*(R"
hashref.
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 1.58
.SH "SUBROUTINES"
.IX Header "SUBROUTINES"
.SS "remove"
.IX Subsection "remove"
Removes files and directories.  Directories are removed recursively like
in \fBrm \-rf\fR if the first argument is a reference to a scalar that
evaluates to true.  If the first argument is a reference to a scalar,
then it is used as the value of the recursive flag.  By default it's
false so only pass \e1 to it.
.PP
If the next argument is a hash reference then it is a key/values of options.
Currently, there is one supported option of \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aqglob\*(Aq => 0\*(C'\fR which prevents
globbing. E.g:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    remove(\e1, {glob => 0}, \*(Aq*\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Will not remove files globbed by '*' and will only remove the file
called asterisk if it exists.
.PP
In list context it returns a list of files/directories removed, in
scalar context it returns the number of files/directories removed.  The
list/number should match what was passed in if everything went well.
.SS "rm"
.IX Subsection "rm"
Just calls \fBremove\fR.  It's there for people who get tired of typing
\&\fBremove\fR.
.SS "clear"
.IX Subsection "clear"
The \f(CW\*(C`clear\*(C'\fR function is a version of \f(CW\*(C`remove\*(C'\fR designed for
use in test scripts. It takes a list of paths that it will both
initially delete during the current test run, and then further
flag for deletion at END-time as a convenience for the next test
run.
.SS "trash"
.IX Subsection "trash"
Removes files and directories, with support for undeleting later.
Accepts an optional \*(L"other platforms\*(R" hashref, passing the remaining
arguments to \fBremove\fR.
.IP "Win32" 4

.IP "Other platforms" 4
.IX Item "Other platforms"
The first argument to \fBtrash()\fR must be a hashref with two keys,
\&'rmdir' and 'unlink', each referencing a coderef.  The coderefs
will be called with the filenames that are to be deleted.

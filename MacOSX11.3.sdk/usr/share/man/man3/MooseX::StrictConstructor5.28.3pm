.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Simply loading this module makes your constructors \*(L"strict\*(R". If your
constructor is called with an attribute init argument that your class does not
declare, then it calls \f(CW\*(C`Moose\->throw_error()\*(C'\fR. This is a great way to
catch small typos.
.SS "Subverting Strictness"
.IX Subsection "Subverting Strictness"
You may find yourself wanting to have your constructor accept a
parameter which does not correspond to an attribute.
.PP
In that case, you'll probably also be writing a \f(CW\*(C`BUILD()\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`BUILDARGS()\*(C'\fR method to deal with that parameter. In a \f(CW\*(C`BUILDARGS()\*(C'\fR
method, you can simply make sure that this parameter is not included
in the hash reference you return. Otherwise, in a \f(CW\*(C`BUILD()\*(C'\fR method,
you can delete it from the hash reference of parameters.

.IX Header "DONATIONS"
If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a \*(L"donation\*(R" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.
.PP
Please note that \fBI am not suggesting that you must do this\fR in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.
.PP
Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time (let's all have a chuckle at that together).
.PP
To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org, or use the

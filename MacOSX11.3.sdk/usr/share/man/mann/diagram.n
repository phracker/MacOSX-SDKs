'\" The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
'\" manual entries.
'\"
'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"
'\" .VE
'\"	End of vertical sidebar.
'\"
'\" .DS
'\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .DE
'\"	End of indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .SO
'\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
'\"	the option's class in the option database.
'\"
'\" .UL arg1 arg2

.SH DESCRIPTION
Welcome to \fBdiagram\fR, a package for the easy construction of
diagrams (sic), i.e. 2D vector graphics, sometimes also called \fIpictures\fR.
Note that this package is not a replacement for \fBTk\fR's canvas,
but rather a layer sitting on top of it, to make it easier to use.
In other words, using the canvas as the core graphics engine \fBdiagram\fR abstracts away from the minutiae of handling coordinates to
position and size the drawn elements, allowing the user to concentrate
on the content of the diagram instead.
.PP
This is similar to Brian Kernighan's PIC language for troff, which is
the spiritual ancestor of this package.
.PP
This document contains the reference to the API and drawing (language)
commands. Its intended audience are users of the package wishing to
refresh their memory.
Newcomers should read the \fIDiagram Language Tutorial\fR first.
Developers wishing to work on the internals of the package and its
supporting packages should look at section
\fBDiagram Classes\fR
first, and then the comments in the sources of the packages itself.
.PP
In the remainder of the document we first describe the APIs of the
diagram class and its instances, followed by the language reference
for the drawing language itself.
.SH API
.SS "CLASS API"
The package exports the API described here.
.TP
\fB::diagram\fR \fIobjectName\fR \fIcanvas\fR ?\fIscript\fR?
The command creates a new instance of a diagram
controller and returns the fully qualified name of the
object command as its result.
The new instance is connected to the specified
\fIcanvas\fR object, which is used as the diagrams
graphics engine. This is usually an instance of Tk's
canvas, however any object which is API compatible to
Tk's canvas can be used here.
.sp
The API of this object command is described in the
following section, \fBObject API\fR. It may be
used to invoke various operations on the object.
.sp
If the \fIscript\fR argument is specified then method
\fBdraw\fR will be invoked on it.
.PP
.SS "OBJECT API"
Instances of the diagram class support the following
methods:
.TP
\fIdiagramObject\fR \fBnew direction\fR \fIname\fR ?\fIkey\fR \fIvalue\fR...?
This method defines a new named direction and its
attributes. The latter is given through the
\fIkey\fR/\fIvalue\fR pairs coming after the \fIname\fR.
.sp
Users are mostly free to specify arbitrary attributes
with whatever meaning they desire. The exception are
the names \fIangle\fR and \fIopposite\fR. They are
special to the diagram package and have a fixed meaning.
.RS
.TP
angle
This attribute specifies the angle of the direction in
degrees, where 0 points east (to the right) and 90 points
north (up).
.TP
opposite
This attribute specifies the name of the direction
which should be considered as complementary to the
named one.
.RE
.TP
\fIdiagramObject\fR \fBnew element\fR \fIname\fR \fIattributes\fR \fIcmdprefix\fR
This method defines a new graphics element for the
drawing language. I.e. \fIname\fR will become a new
command in the language, and the specified command
prefix (\fIcmdprefix\fR) will be called to perform
the actual drawing.
.sp
\fIattributes\fR specifies the set of attributes for which
data has to be available. I.e. the system will run the
...-callbacks for these attributes.
See the method \fBnew attribute\fR for more information
on attribute definitions.
.sp
The command prefix is expected to conform to the
following signature:
.RS
.TP
\fBcmdprefix\fR \fIcanvas\fR \fIattributes\fR
Where \fIcanvas\fR is the handle of the canvas widget
to draw to, and \fIattributes\fR is a dictionary
holding the attributes for the element, be they
user-specified, or defaults.
.sp
The results of the command has to be a list containing
at least two and at most four items. These are, in order:
.RS
.IP [1]
The list of canvas items the drawn element consists of.
.IP [2]
The dictionary of named locations in the element, its
\fIcorners\fR.
.IP [3]
An optional mode, either "relative" or "absolute".
When not returned "relative" is assumed. In the
case of a relative element position the attributes
"with" and "at" are used to determine the final
position of the new element.
.IP [4]
An optional name of a direction. If not the
empty string this is handed to the automatic
layouter as the new direction to follow.
.RE
.RE
.TP
\fIdiagramObject\fR \fBnew alias\fR \fIname\fR \fIcmdprefix\fR
This method defines a new command for the drawing
language. I.e. \fIname\fR will become a new command in
the language, and the specified command prefix
(\fIcmdprefix\fR) will be called on use of this new
command. Any arguments given to the command are
simply passed to the prefix. There is no fixed siganture.
.sp
Note that the prefix is run in the context of the
drawing language, allowing the direct use of any
existing commands.
.TP
\fIdiagramObject\fR \fBnew command\fR \fIname\fR \fIarguments\fR \fIbody\fR
This is like \fBnew alias\fR except that the new
command is defined as a procedure in the language's
context, with regular argument list and body.
.TP
\fIdiagramObject\fR \fBnew attribute\fR \fIname\fR ?\fIkey\fR \fIvalue\fR...?
This method defines a new named attribute which can be
used by graphical elements. The handling of the
attribute by the processor is declared through the
\fIkey\fR/\fIvalue\fR pairs coming after the \fIname\fR.
.sp
The accepted keys and their meanings are:
.RS
.TP
\fBkey\fR
The value of this key is the name of the key
under which the attribute's value shall be
stored in the attribute dictionary given to
the drawing command after attribute processing
is complete.
.sp
This key is optional. If it is not specified it
defaults to the name of the attribute.
.TP
\fBget\fR
The value of this key is a command prefix
which will be invoked to retrieve the
attribute's argument(s) from the command
line.
.sp
This key is optional. If it is not specified a
default is used which takes the single word
after the attribute name as the attribute's
value.
.sp
The signature of the command prefix is
.RS
.TP
\fBcmdprefix\fR \fIwordqueue\fR
Where \fIwordqueue\fR is the handle of
a queue object conforming to the API
of the queues provided by package
\fBstruct::queue\fR. This queue
contains the not-yet-processed part of
the attribute definitions, with one
entry per word, with the first entry
the word \fIafter\fR name of the
attribute. In other words, the
attribute's name has already been
removed from the queue.
.sp
The result of the command is the value
of the attribute, which may have been
taken from the queue, or not.
.RE
.TP
\fBtransform\fR
The value of this key is a command prefix
which will be invoked to transform the
retrieved value (See \fBget\fR) into their
final form.
.sp
This key is optional. If it is not specified
no transformation is done.
The signature of the command prefix is
.RS
.TP
\fBcmdprefix\fR \fIvalue\fR
Where \fIvalue\fR is the value to transform.
.sp
The result of the command is the final
value of the attribute.
.RE
.TP
\fBtype\fR
The value of this key is a command prefix
which will be invoked to validate the
attribute's argument(s).
.sp
This key is optional. If it is not specified
no validation is done.
.sp
The signature of the command prefix is that of
snit validation types. See the documentation
of the \fBsnit\fR package.
.TP
\fBmerge\fR
The value of this key is a command prefix
which will be invoked to insert the
transformed and validated attribute value into
the dictionary of collected attributes.
.sp
This key is optional. If it is not specified
a default merge is chosen, based on the data
for key \fBaggregate\fR, see below.
The signature of the command prefix is
.RS
.TP
\fBcmdprefix\fR \fIvalue\fR \fIdict\fR
Where \fIvalue\fR is the value to
insert, and \fIdict\fR the dictionary
of attributes and values collected so
far.
.sp
The result of the command is the new
dictionary of attributes.
.RE
.TP
\fBaggregate\fR
The value of this key is a boolean flag. It
has an effect if and only if the key \fBmerge\fR was not specified. This key is
optional. If it is not specified it defaults
to \fBFalse\fR.
.sp
If the key is effective, the value of \fBFalse\fR means that the attribute's value is
\fIset\fR into the dictionary using the value
of key \fIkey\fR (see above) as index,
\fIoverwriting\fR any previously specified value.
.sp
If the key is effective, the value of \fBTrue\fR means that the attribute's value is
\fIadded\fR to the dictionary using the value
of key \fIkey\fR (see above) as index,
\fIextending\fR any previously specified value.
This means that the final value of the
attribute as seen after processing will be a
list of the collected values.
.TP
\fBdefault\fR
The value of this key is a command prefix
which will be invoked after collection of
attributes has been completed and this
attribute is in the list of required
attributes for the drawing element (See
argument \fIattributes\fR of method
\fBnew element\fR).
.sp
Note that the connection is made through the
value of key \fIkey\fR, not through the
attribute name per se.
.sp
Further note that this command prefix is
invoked even if a user specified attribute
value is present. This allows the command
to go beyond simply setting defaults, it
can calculate and store derived values as
well.
.sp
This key is optional. If an element requires
this attribute, but \fIdefault\fR is not
specified then nothing will be done.
.sp
The signature of the command prefix is
.RS
.TP
\fBcmdprefix\fR \fBinit\fR
This method is run when the attribute
is defined, its responsibility is to
initialize anything in the language
namespace for the attribute and
default processing.
.sp
The result of this method is ignored.
.TP
\fBcmdprefix\fR \fBfill\fR \fIvarname\fR
This method is run to put defaults, or
derived values into the attribute dictionary
named by \fIvarname\fR. This variable will
be found in the calling context.
.sp
The result of this method is ignored.
.TP
\fBcmdprefix\fR \fBset\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
This method is run to push current a
attribute value into the language
namespace, to make it the new default.
.sp
The result of this method is ignored.
.RE
.TP
\fBlinked\fR
This key is effective if and only if key
\fBdefault\fR is not specified. In that
case is supplies a default handling for
\fBdefault\fR, linking the attribute to a
variable in the language context.
.sp
The value for this key is a 2-element list
containing the name of the variable to link
to, and its initial value, in this order.
.RE
.TP
\fIdiagramObject\fR \fBunknown attribute\fR \fIcmdprefix\fR
This method registers the command prefix with the
subsystem processing the attributes for element
commands, telling it to call it when it encounters an
attribute it is unable to handle on its on.
.sp
It is allowed to register more than callback, these
will be called in order of registration (i.e. first to
last), until one of the callbacks accepts the current
input.
The command prefix is expected to conform to the
following signature:
.RS
.TP
\fBcmdprefix\fR \fIwordqueue\fR
Where \fIwordqueue\fR is the handle of a queue
object conforming to the API of the queues
provided by package \fBstruct::queue\fR.
This queue contains the not-yet-processed part
of the attribute definitions, with one entry
per word, with the first entry the name of the
attribute which could not be processed.
.sp
The results of the command has to be a boolean
value where \fBTrue\fR signals that this
callback has accepted the attribute, processed
it, and the new state of the \fIwordqueue\fR
is where the general processing shall continue.
.sp
Given the signature the command has basically
two ways of handling (rewriting) the attributes
it recognizes:
.RS
.IP [1]
Replace the attribute (and arguments)
with a different attribute and arguments.
.IP [2]
Push additional words in front to get
the general processing unstuck.
.RE
.RE
.TP
\fIdiagramObject\fR \fBdraw\fR \fIscript\fR
This method runs the given \fIscript\fR in the
context of the drawing language definitions.
See section \fBLanguage Reference\fR for
details on the available commands.
.sp
\fINote\fR that \fIscript\fR is \fItrusted\fR.
It is executed in the current interpreter with
access to its full abilities.
For the execution of untrusted diagram scripts this
interpreter should be a safe one.
.PP
.SH "LANGUAGE REFERENCE"
.SS ELEMENTS
This section lists the commands for the predefined drawing elements,
aka shapes. These commands are all defined in the language's context.
All commands of this section return the handle of the newly created
element as their result. This handle also exists as a command which
can be used to query the element for its corners (names, values).
See section \fBMiscellaneous Commands\fR.
IMAGE: figure-02-basic-shapes
.TP
\fBarc\fR \fIattr\fR...
IMAGE: figure-02-arc
An open element with the corresponding corners, i.e. "start", "end",
and "center".
Note however that it also has the compass rose of closed elements as
its corners, with the center of the arc's circle as the center of the
compass and the other points on the circle the arc is part of.
It handles the attributes

\fBblock\fR \fIscript\fR \fIattr\fR...
A closed element with the corresponding corners, i.e. the eight

The main effect is the aggregration of all elements created by the
\fIscript\fR into one element.
This also means that while the elements created by the script are
visible in the element history while the script is executing,
afterward the history contains only the block itself, and not the
elements it is composed of.
.sp
The script has access to the current state of all variables in the
language context.
Any changes to the variables will be reverted after execution of the
block.
However, also, any variables set in the script will be exported as
corners of the element, allowing users to define their own named
locations in the block.
.sp
Regarding the layout mechanism any changes made by the script are
reverted after the element is done.
In other words, a block is an implicit \fBgroup\fR.
.sp
Blocks handle all attributes, propgating their settings into the
script as the default values active during script execution.

Specifies where to draw arrowheads on the \fBline\fR element, at the
beginning or end, at both ends, or none.
If not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the
language variable \fBarrowhead\fR, which itself defaults to
\fBnone\fR.
The legal values are
.RS
.TP
\fBnone\fR, \fB-\fR
Draw no arrowheads, at neither end of the line.

.RE
Note that the values "start", "end", "-", "->", "<-", and "<->" are
all accepted as shorthands for the \fBarrowhead\fR command using them
as argument.
.TP
\fBaspect\fR \fInumber\fR
Specifies the aspect ratio, i.e ratio of width to height, of the
\fBdiamond\fR element.
The manner in which a default is calculated when not specified also
depends on the specifications of the attributes \fBwidth\fR and
\fBheight\fR, if any.
.sp
If both \fBwidth\fR, and \fBheight\fR are specified then any
specification of \fBaspect\fR is ignored, as it is implicitly defined
in the width and height as well, and this takes precedence. A missing
specification is ignored in that case well, i.e. no defaults are
required.
.sp
If the \fBaspect\fR is specified, and one of the attributes
\fBwidth\fR or \fBheight\fR, then the missing attribute is calculated
from the two which are specified. No defaults are required for these
cases either.
.sp
If only one of the attributes \fBwidth\fR or \fBheight\fR is specified
then the system uses a fallback for the \fBaspect\fR, the value taken
from the language variable \fBdiamondaspect\fR, which itselfs defaults
to \fB2\fR.
.sp
If none of of the attributes \fBwidth\fR or \fBheight\fR is specified
then the system uses a fallback for the \fBwidth\fR, the value taken
from the language variable \fBboxwidth\fR, which itselfs defaults to
the pixel equivalent of \fB2 cm\fR. For the aspect it uses either
the user-specified value or the default taken as described in the
previous paragraph.
.TP
\fBaspect\fR \fInumber\fR
Specifies the aspect ratio, i.e ratio of width to height, of the
ellipses which are used to draw the top and bottom of the \fBdrum\fR
element.

language variable \fBdrumaspect\fR, which itself defaults to
\fB0.35\fR.
.TP
\fBat\fR \fIlocation\fR
Specifies the location of the element's corner named by the attribute
\fBwith\fR.
Defaults to the current location as maintained by the layouting
system.
.TP
\fBat\fR \fIlocation\fR
\fBLine\fR elements are normally positioned absolutely, using the
locations specified through the attributes \fBfrom\fR, \fBthen\fR, and
\fBto\fR.
If \fBat\fR is specified however then these positions are translated a
last time, moving the line's corner named by the attribute \fBwith\fR
to the location given by this attribute.
.TP
\fBchop\fR ?\fIlength\fR?
Specifies the length of the \fBline\fR element to remove from the
beginning and/or end.
Defaults to nothing.
If specified once the chopping applies to both beginning and end of
the line.
If specified twice or more the last two specifications are used, and
applied to beginning and end of the line, in this order.
Whenever the attribute is specified without an explicit length, the
system falls back to the value taken from the language variable
\fBcircleradius\fR, which itself defaults to the pixel equivalent of
\fB1 cm\fR
.TP

\fBccw\fR
Specifies the direction of the \fBarc\fR element, here

.TP
\fBdiameter\fR \fIlength\fR
.TP
\fBdiam\fR \fIlength\fR
Specifies the diameter of the \fBcircle\fR element, as an alternative
way to specify its \fBradius\fR.
Effective if and only if the radius was not specified. I.e. if both
diameter and radius are specified then the radius infomration has
precendence.
This attribute has no default, because the defaults are taken from the
radius.
.TP
\fBfillcolor\fR \fIspec\fR
IMAGE: figure-21-style-colors
Specifies the color used to draw the inside of the element.
If not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the
language variable \fBfillcolor\fR, which itself defaults to the empty
string, signaling "no filling".
.TP

system.
.TP

language variable \fBboxheight\fR, which itself defaults to the
pixel equivalent of \fB2 cm\fR.
.TP
\fBheight\fR \fIlength\fR
Specifies the height of the \fBdiamond\fR element.
The manner in which a default is calculated when not specified also
depends on the specifications of the attributes \fBaspect\fR and
\fBwidth\fR, if any.
.sp
If both \fBwidth\fR, and \fBheight\fR are specified then any
specification of \fBaspect\fR is ignored, as it is implicitly defined
in the width and height as well, and this takes precedence. A missing
specification is ignored in that case well, i.e. no defaults are

.sp
If the \fBaspect\fR is specified, and one of the attributes
\fBwidth\fR or \fBheight\fR, then the missing attribute is calculated
from the two which are specified. No defaults are required for these
cases either.
.sp
If only one of the attributes \fBwidth\fR or \fBheight\fR is specified
then the system uses a fallback for the \fBaspect\fR, the value taken
from the language variable \fBdiamondaspect\fR, which itselfs defaults
to \fB2\fR.
.sp
If none of of the attributes \fBwidth\fR or \fBheight\fR is specified
then the system uses a fallback for the \fBwidth\fR, the value taken
from the language variable \fBboxwidth\fR, which itselfs defaults to
the pixel equivalent of \fB2 cm\fR. For the aspect it uses either
the user-specified value or the default taken as described in the
previous paragraph.
.TP

Specifies the height of the \fBtext\fR element.
Defaults to the natural height of its text.
.TP
\fBjustify\fR \fBleft\fR|\fBcenter\fR|\fBright\fR
Specifies how multi-line text associated with the element is
positioned within its box.
The value is ignored if no text was specified for the element.
If not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the
language variable \fBjustify\fR, which itself defaults to
\fBleft\fR.
The legal values are \fBleft\fR, \fBright\fR, and \fBcenter\fR.
.TP
\fBnoturn\fR
Specifies that the direction of \fBline\fR element at its end is not
propagated to the layout management.
If not specified the direction of the line becomes the new direction
the layout.
.TP
\fBradius\fR \fIlength\fR
.TP
\fBrad\fR \fIlength\fR
Specifies the radius of the \fBcircle\fR element.
If not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the
language variable \fBcircleradius\fR, which itself defaults to the
pixel equivalent of \fB1 cm\fR.
.TP
\fBradius\fR \fIlength\fR
Specifies the radius of the \fBarc\fR element, or rather, the radius
of the circle the shown arc is a part of.
If not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the
language variable \fBarcradius\fR, which itself defaults to the pixel
equivalent of \fB1 cm\fR.
.TP
\fBslant\fR \fIangle\fR
Specifies the angle by which the \fBbox\fR element is slanted, in
degrees.
If not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the
language variable \fBslant\fR, which itself defaults to \fB90\fR,
i.e. vertical, no slant.
0 degrees is slanting straight east, pointing to the right.
90 degrees is slanting to the north, pointing straight up.
.TP
\fBsmooth\fR

.TP
\fBstyle\fR \fIspec\fR
IMAGE: figure-18-style-dash
Specifies the style used to draw the lines of the element.
If not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the
language variable \fBlinestyle\fR, which itself defaults to
\fBsolid\fR lines.
The legal values are all those accepted by
\fITk_GetDash\fR [http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/GetDash.htm],
and additionally all which are listed below:

.RE
Note that the values "solid", "dot(ted)", "dash(ed)", "dash-dot", and
"dash-dot-dot" are all accepted as shorthands for the \fBstyle\fR
command using them as argument.
.TP
\fBtext\fR \fIstring\fR
Specifies the text to associate with the element.
Defaults to nothing.
When specified multiple times the actually shown text is the
concatenation of the individual strings, vertically stacked, with the
first string specified being the topmost element.
.TP
\fBtextcolor\fR \fIspec\fR
Specifies the color used to draw the text of an element with.
Ignored if there is no text.

\fBtextfont\fR \fIspec\fR
Specifies the font used to draw the text of an element with.
Ignored if there is no text.
If not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the

.TP
\fBthen\fR \fIlocation\fR
.TP
\fBthen\fR (<direction> ?\fIlength\fR?)...
.TP
(<direction> ?\fIlength\fR?)...
This attribute specifies an intermediate location the \fBline\fR
element has to go through.
It can be specified multiple times, with each use adding one
additional location to the series which the line will go
through. These location will be traversed in the order they were
specified.
.sp
The location can be given explicitly, or as a series of directions
with distances. In the latter case the names of all known directions
are accepted for the direction part.
If no distance is specified for a direction the system falls back to
the value taken from the language variable \fBmovelength\fR, which
itself defaults to the pixel equivalent of \fB2 cm\fR.
The whole set of direction,distance pairs is treated as a series of
translations which are added up to provide the final translation
specifying the intermediate point (relative to the preceding point).
.sp
The last named direction is propagated to the layout system as the
direction to follow. The use of \fBnoturn\fR is not able to overide
this behaviour.
.sp
At last, the names of the registered directions also serve as
attribute commands, with an implicit attribute \fBthen\fR in front of
them.
.sp
If no intermediate or last location is specified for the line the
system falls back to a point \fBmovelength\fR pixels away from the
starting location, in the current direction as maintained by the
layouting system
.TP
\fBto\fR \fIlocation\fR
Specifies the location where the \fBline\fR element ends.
This attribute has no default. The default is handled by the attribute
\fBthen\fR, which makes it appear as if \fBto\fR has a default when
not specified.
.TP
\fBto\fR \fIlocation\fR
Specifies the location where the \fBarc\fR element ends.
Defaults to a location such that a 90-degree arc is drawn in the
chosen direction, starting at \fBfrom\fR.
.TP
\fBwidth\fR \fIlength\fR
.TP
\fBwid\fR \fIlength\fR
Specifies the width of the element.
If not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the
language variable \fBboxwidth\fR, which itself defaults to the pixel
equivalent of \fB2 cm\fR.
.TP
\fBwidth\fR \fIlength\fR
Specifies the width of the \fBdiamond\fR element.
The manner in which a default is calculated when not specified also
depends on the specifications of the attributes \fBaspect\fR and
\fBheight\fR, if any.
.sp
If both \fBwidth\fR, and \fBheight\fR are specified then any
specification of \fBaspect\fR is ignored, as it is implicitly defined
in the width and height as well, and this takes precedence. A missing
specification is ignored in that case well, i.e. no defaults are
required.
.sp
If the \fBaspect\fR is specified, and one of the attributes
\fBwidth\fR or \fBheight\fR, then the missing attribute is calculated
from the two which are specified. No defaults are required for these
cases either.
.sp
If only one of the attributes \fBwidth\fR or \fBheight\fR is specified
then the system uses a fallback for the \fBaspect\fR, the value taken
from the language variable \fBdiamondaspect\fR, which itselfs defaults
to \fB2\fR.
.sp
If none of of the attributes \fBwidth\fR or \fBheight\fR is specified
then the system uses a fallback for the \fBwidth\fR, the value taken
from the language variable \fBboxwidth\fR, which itselfs defaults to
the pixel equivalent of \fB2 cm\fR. For the aspect it uses either
the user-specified value or the default taken as described in the
previous paragraph.
.TP
\fBwidth\fR \fIlength\fR
Specifies the width of the \fBtext\fR element.
Defaults to the natural width of its text.
.TP
\fBwith\fR \fIcorner\fR
Specifies the corner of the element to place at the location given by
the attribute \fBat\fR.
Defaults to the current corner as maintained by the layouting system,
except if the value for \fBat\fR was specified by the user. In that
case it defaults to \fBcenter\fR.
.TP
\fBwith\fR \fIcorner\fR
\fBLine\fR elements are normally positioned absolutely, using the
locations specified through the attributes \fBfrom\fR, \fBthen\fR, and
\fBto\fR.
If \fBat\fR is specified however then these positions are translated a
last time, moving the line's corner named by the attribute \fBwith\fR
to the location given by this attribute.
This means that \fIwith\fR is effective if and only if the attribute
\fBat\fR was specified as well for the line.
.PP
.SS CORNERS
Corners are named values for in elements, usually locations.

The \fIclosed\fR elements define corners for the compass rose,
including the "center", and their "width" and "height".

.SS "NAMED DIRECTIONS"
The named directions are commands which tell the layout system in
which direction to go when placing the next element without an
explicit position specification.
They can also be used as arguments to the attribute \fBthen\fR, and
the command \fBby\fR for relative points, see there for the relevant

.SH "DIAGRAM CLASSES"     The intended audience of this section are developers wishing to work
on the internals of the diagram package.

Regular users of \fBdiagram\fR can skip this section without
missing anything.


.PP


The main information seen here is the figure below, showing the
hierarchy of the classes implementing diagram.


.PP
IMAGE: figure-00-dependencies
.PP


At the bottom, all at the same level are the supporting packages like
\fBsnit\fR, etc. These can all be found in Tcllib.


.PP


Above them is the set of diagram classes implementing the various
aspects of the system, i.e.:




.TP
\fBdiagram\fR

The main class, that which is seen by the user.


.TP
\fBdiagram::core\fR

The core engine, itself distributed over four helper classes.


.TP
\fBdiagram::basic\fR

The implementation of the standard shapes, like box, circle, etc.,
based on the extension features of the core.


.TP
\fBdiagram::element\fR

Core support class, the database of created elements. It also keeps
the history, i.e. the order in which elements were created.


.TP
\fBdiagram::attribute\fR

Core support class, the generic handling of definition and processing
of attributes.


.TP
\fBdiagram::direction\fR

Core support class, the database of named directions.


.TP
\fBdiagram::navigation\fR

Core support class, the state of layout engine, i.e. current position
and directin, and operations on it.


.TP
\fBdiagram::point\fR

General support class handling various vector operations.

'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"

'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives

.SH DESCRIPTION
This package provides a class for the creation of objects able to
process and convert text written in the \fIdoctools\fR markup
language into any output format X for which a
\fIformatting engine\fR is available.
.PP
A reader interested in the markup language itself should start with
the \fIdoctools language introduction\fR and proceed from there to
the formal specifications, i.e. the \fIdoctools language syntax\fR
and the \fIdoctools language command reference\fR.
.PP
If on the other hand the reader wishes to write her own formatting
engine for some format, i.e. is a \fIplugin writer\fR then reading
and understanding the \fIdoctools plugin API reference\fR is an
absolute necessity, as that document specifies the interaction between
this package and its plugins, i.e. the formatting engines, in detail.
.SH "PUBLIC API"
.SS "PACKAGE COMMANDS"
.TP
\fB::doctools::new\fR \fIobjectName\fR ?\fIoption value\fR...?
This command creates a new doctools object with an associated Tcl
command whose name is \fIobjectName\fR. This \fIobject\fR command is
explained in full detail in the sections \fBOBJECT COMMAND\fR
and \fBOBJECT METHODS\fR. The object command will be created
under the current namespace if the \fIobjectName\fR is not fully
qualified, and in the specified namespace otherwise.
.sp
The options and their values coming after the name of the object are
used to set the initial configuration of the object.
.TP
\fB::doctools::help\fR
This is a convenience command for applications wishing to provide
their user with a short description of the available formatting
commands and their meanings. It returns a string containing a standard
help text.
.TP
\fB::doctools::search\fR \fIpath\fR
Whenever an object created by this the package has to map the name of
a format to the file containing the code for its formatting engine it
will search for the file in a number of directories stored in a
list. See section \fBFORMAT MAPPING\fR for more explanations.
.sp
This list not only contains three default directories which are
declared by the package itself, but is also extensible user of the
package.
This command is the means to do so. When given a \fIpath\fR to an
existing and readable directory it will prepend that directory to the
list of directories to search. This means that the \fIpath\fR added
last is later searched through first.
.sp
An error will be thrown if the \fIpath\fR either does not exist, is
not a directory, or is not readable.
.PP
.SS "OBJECT COMMAND"
All commands created by \fB::doctools::new\fR have the following
general form and may be used to invoke various operations on their
doctools converter object.
.TP
\fBobjectName\fR \fBmethod\fR ?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
The method \fBmethod\fR and its \fIarg\fR'uments determine the exact
behavior of the command. See section \fBOBJECT METHODS\fR for
the detailed specifications.
.PP
.SS "OBJECT METHODS"
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBconfigure\fR
The method returns a list of all known options and their current
values when called without any arguments.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBconfigure\fR \fIoption\fR
The method behaves like the method \fBcget\fR when called with a
single argument and returns the value of the option specified by said
argument.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBconfigure\fR \fB-option\fR \fIvalue\fR...
The method reconfigures the specified \fBoption\fRs of the object,
setting them to the associated \fIvalue\fRs, when called with an even
number of arguments, at least two.
.sp
The legal options are described in the section
\fBOBJECT CONFIGURATION\fR.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBcget\fR \fB-option\fR
This method expects a legal configuration option as argument and will
return the current value of that option for the object the method was
invoked for.
.sp
The legal configuration options are described in section
\fBOBJECT CONFIGURATION\fR.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBdestroy\fR
This method destroys the object it is invoked for.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBformat\fR \fItext\fR
This method runs the \fItext\fR through the configured formatting
engine and returns the generated string as its result. An error will
be thrown if no \fB-format\fR was configured for the object.
.sp
The method assumes that the \fItext\fR is in \fIdoctools\fR format as
specified in the companion document \fIdoctools_fmt\fR. Errors will
be thrown otherwise.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBmap\fR \fIsymbolic\fR \fIactual\fR
This methods add one entry to the per-object mapping from
\fIsymbolic\fR filenames to the \fIactual\fR uris.
The object just stores this mapping and makes it available to the
configured formatting engine through the command \fBdt_fmap\fR.
This command is described in more detail in the
\fIdoctools plugin API reference\fR which specifies the interaction
between the objects created by this package and doctools formatting
engines.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBparameters\fR
This method returns a list containing the names of all engine
parameters provided by the configured formatting engine. It will
return an empty list if the object is not yet configured for a
specific format.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBsearch\fR \fIpath\fR
This method extends the per-object list of paths searched for doctools
formatting engines. See also the command \fB::doctools::search\fR on
how to extend the per-package list of paths. Note that the path
entered last will be searched first.
For more details see section \fBFORMAT MAPPING\fR.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBsetparam\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
This method sets the \fIname\fRd engine parameter to the specified
\fIvalue\fR.
It will throw an error if the object is either not yet configured for
a specific format, or if the formatting engine for the configured
format does not provide a parameter with the given \fIname\fR.
The list of parameters provided by the configured formatting engine
can be retrieved through the method \fBparameters\fR.
.TP
\fIobjectName\fR \fBwarnings\fR
This method returns a list containing all the warnings which were
generated by the configured formatting engine during the last
invocation of the method \fBformat\fR.
.PP
.SS "OBJECT CONFIGURATION"
All doctools objects understand the following configuration options:
.TP
\fB-file\fR \fIfile\fR
The argument of this option is stored in the object and made available
to the configured formatting engine through the commands \fBdt_file\fR
and \fBdt_mainfile\fR.
These commands are described in more detail in the companion document
\fIdoctools_api\fR which specifies the API between the object and
formatting engines.
.sp
The default value of this option is the empty string.
.sp
The configured formatting engine should interpret the value as the
name of the file containing the document which is currently processed.
.TP
\fB-module\fR \fItext\fR
The argument of this option is stored in the object and made available
to the configured formatting engine through the command \fBdt_module\fR.
This command is described in more detail in the companion document
\fIdoctools_api\fR which specifies the API between the object and
formatting engines.
.sp
The default value of this option is the empty string.
.sp
The configured formatting engine should interpret the value as the
name of the module the file containing the document which is currently
processed belongs to.
.TP
\fB-format\fR \fItext\fR
The argument of this option specifies the format to generate and by
implication the formatting engine to use when converting text via the
method \fBformat\fR. Its default value is the empty string. The
method \fBformat\fR cannot be used if this option is not set to a
valid value at least once.
.sp
The package will immediately try to map the given name to a file
containing the code for a formatting engine generating that format. An
error will be thrown if this mapping fails. In that case a previously
configured format is left untouched.
.sp
The section \fBFORMAT MAPPING\fR explains in detail how the
package and object will look for engine implementations.
.TP
\fB-deprecated\fR \fIboolean\fR
This option is a boolean flag. The object will generate warnings if
this flag is set and the text given to method \fBformat\fR contains
the deprecated markup command \fBstrong\fR.
Its default value is \fBFALSE\fR. In other words, no warnings will
be generated.
.TP
\fB-copyright\fR \fItext\fR
The argument of this option is stored in the object and made available
to the configured formatting engine through the command \fBdt_copyright\fR.
This command is described in more detail in the companion document
\fIdoctools_api\fR which specifies the API between the object and
formatting engines.
.sp
The default value of this option is the empty string.
.sp
The configured formatting engine should interpret the value as a
copyright assignment for the document which is currently processed, or
the package described by it.
.sp
This information must be used if and only if the engine is unable to
find any copyright assignments within the document itself. Such are
specified by the formatting command \fBcopyright\fR. This command is
described in more detail in the companion document \fIdoctools_fmt\fR
which specifies the \fIdoctools\fR format itself.
.PP
.SS "FORMAT MAPPING"
The package and object will perform the following algorithm when
trying to map a format name \fIfoo\fR to a file containing an
implementation of a formatting engine for \fIfoo\fR:
.IP [1]
If \fIfoo\fR is the name of an existing file then this file is
directly taken as the implementation.
.IP [2]
If not, the list of per-object search paths is searched. For each
directory in the list the package checks if that directory contains a
file "\fIfmt.\fIfoo\fR\fR". If yes, then that file is taken as the
implementation.
.sp
Note that this list of paths is initially empty and can be extended
through the object method \fBsearch\fR.
.IP [3]
If not, the list of package paths is searched.
For each directory in the list the package checks if that directory
contains a file "\fIfmt.\fIfoo\fR\fR". If yes, then that file is taken
as the implementation.
.sp
This list of paths can be extended
through the command \fB::doctools::search\fR.
It contains initially one path, the subdirectory "\fImpformats\fR" of
the directory the package itself is located in.
In other words, if the package implementation "\fIdoctools.tcl\fR" is
installed in the directory "\fI/usr/local/lib/tcllib/doctools\fR" then
it will by default search the
directory "\fI/usr/local/lib/tcllib/doctools/mpformats\fR" for format
implementations.
.IP [4]
The mapping fails.
.PP
.SH "PREDEFINED ENGINES"
The package provides predefined engines for the following
formats. Some of the engines support parameters. These will be
explained below as well.
.TP
html
This engine generates HTML markup, for processing by web browsers and
the like. This engine supports four parameters:
.RS
.TP
footer
The value for this parameter has to be valid selfcontained HTML markup
for the body section of a HTML document. The default value is the
empty string. The value is inserted into the generated output just
before the \fB</body>\fR tag, closing the body of the generated
HTML.
.sp
This can be used to insert boilerplate footer markup into the
generated document.
.TP
header
The value for this parameter has to be valid selfcontained HTML markup
for the body section of a HTML document. The default value is the
empty string. The value is inserted into the generated output just
after the \fB<body>\fR tag, starting the body of the generated HTML.
.sp
This can be used to insert boilerplate header markup into the
generated document.
.TP
meta
The value for this parameter has to be valid selfcontained HTML markup
for the header section of a HTML document. The default value is the
empty string. The value is inserted into the generated output just
after the \fB<head>\fR tag, starting the header section of the
generated HTML.
.sp
This can be used to insert boilerplate meta data markup into the
generated document, like references to a stylesheet, standard meta
keywords, etc.
.TP
xref
The value for this parameter has to be a list of triples specifying
cross-reference information. This information is used by the engine to
create more hyperlinks. Each triple is a list containing a pattern,
symbolic filename and fragment reference, in this order. If a pattern
is specified multiple times the last occurence of the pattern will be
used.
.sp
The engine will consult the xref database when encountering specific
commands and will create a link if the relevant text matches one of
the patterns. No link will be created if no match was found. The link
will go to the uri \fBfile#fragment\fR listed in the relevant
triple, after conversion of the symbolic file name to the actual uri
via \fBdt_fmap\fR (see the \fIdoctools plugin API reference\fR).
This file-to-uri mapping was build by calls to the method \fBmap\fR
of the doctools object (See section \fBOBJECT METHODS\fR).
.sp
The following formatting commands will consult the xref database:
.RS
.TP
\fBcmd\fR \fIword\fR
The command will look for the patterns \fBsa,\fR\fIword\fR, and
\fIword\fR, in this order. If this fails if it will convert \fIword\fR
to all lowercase and try again.
.TP
\fBsyscmd\fR \fIword\fR
The command will look for the patterns \fBsa,\fR\fIword\fR, and
\fIword\fR, in this order. If this fails if it will convert \fIword\fR
to all lowercase and try again.
.TP
\fBterm\fR \fIword\fR
The command will look for the patterns \fBkw,\fR\fIword\fR,
\fBsa,\fR\fIword\fR, and \fIword\fR, in this order. If this fails if
it will convert \fIword\fR to all lowercase and try again.
.TP
\fBpackage\fR \fIword\fR
The command will look for the patterns \fBsa,\fR\fIword\fR,
\fBkw,\fR\fIword\fR, and \fIword\fR, in this order. If this fails if
it will convert \fIword\fR to all lowercase and try again.
.TP
\fBsee_also\fR \fIword\fR...
The command will look for the patterns \fBsa,\fR\fIword\fR, and
\fIword\fR, in this order, for each \fIword\fR given to the
command. If this fails if it will convert \fIword\fR to all lowercase
and try again.
.TP
\fBkeywords\fR \fIword\fR...
The command will look for the patterns \fBkw,\fR\fIword\fR, and
\fIword\fR, in this order, for each \fIword\fR given to the
command. If this fails if it will convert \fIword\fR to all lowercase
and try again.

.TP
latex
This engine generates output suitable for the \fBlatex\fR text
processor coming out of the TeX world.
.TP
list
This engine retrieves version, section and title of the manpage from
the document. As such it can be used to generate a directory listing
for a set of manpages.
.TP
nroff
This engine generates nroff output, for processing by \fBnroff\fR,
or \fBgroff\fR. The result will be standard man pages as they are
known in the unix world.
.TP
null
This engine generates no outout at all. This can be used if one just
wants to validate some input.
.TP
tmml
This engine generates TMML markup as specified by Joe English. The Tcl
Manpage Markup Language is a derivate of XML.
.TP
wiki
This engine generates Wiki markup as understood by Jean Claude
Wippler's \fBwikit\fR application.

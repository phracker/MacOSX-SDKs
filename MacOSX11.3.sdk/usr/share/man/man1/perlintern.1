.SH "CV reference counts and CvOUTSIDE"
.IX Header "CV reference counts and CvOUTSIDE"
.IP "CvWEAKOUTSIDE" 8
.IX Xref "CvWEAKOUTSIDE"
.IX Item "CvWEAKOUTSIDE"
Each \s-1CV\s0 has a pointer, \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE()\*(C'\fR, to its lexically enclosing
\&\s-1CV\s0 (if any).  Because pointers to anonymous sub prototypes are
stored in \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR pad slots, it is a possible to get a circular reference,
with the parent pointing to the child and vice-versa.  To avoid the
ensuing memory leak, we do not increment the reference count of the \s-1CV\s0
pointed to by \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR in the \fIone specific instance\fR that the parent
has a \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR pad slot pointing back to us.  In this case, we set the
\&\f(CW\*(C`CvWEAKOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR flag in the child.  This allows us to determine under what
circumstances we should decrement the refcount of the parent when freeing
the child.
.Sp
There is a further complication with non-closure anonymous subs (i.e. those
that do not refer to any lexicals outside that sub).  In this case, the
anonymous prototype is shared rather than being cloned.  This has the
consequence that the parent may be freed while there are still active
children, \fIe.g.\fR,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    BEGIN { $a = sub { eval \*(Aq$x\*(Aq } }
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, the \s-1BEGIN\s0 is freed immediately after execution since there
are no active references to it: the anon sub prototype has
\&\f(CW\*(C`CvWEAKOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR set since it's not a closure, and \f(CW$a\fR points to the same
\&\s-1CV,\s0 so it doesn't contribute to \s-1BEGIN\s0's refcount either.  When \f(CW$a\fR is
executed, the \f(CW\*(C`eval \*(Aq$x\*(Aq\*(C'\fR causes the chain of \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE\*(C'\fRs to be followed,
and the freed \s-1BEGIN\s0 is accessed.
.Sp
To avoid this, whenever a \s-1CV\s0 and its associated pad is freed, any
\&\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR entries in the pad are explicitly removed from the pad, and if the
refcount of the pointed-to anon sub is still positive, then that
child's \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR is set to point to its grandparent.  This will only
occur in the single specific case of a non-closure anon prototype
having one or more active references (such as \f(CW$a\fR above).
.Sp
One other thing to consider is that a \s-1CV\s0 may be merely undefined
rather than freed, eg \f(CW\*(C`undef &foo\*(C'\fR.  In this case, its refcount may
not have reached zero, but we still delete its pad and its \f(CW\*(C`CvROOT\*(C'\fR etc.
Since various children may still have their \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR pointing at this
undefined \s-1CV,\s0 we keep its own \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR for the time being, so that
the chain of lexical scopes is unbroken.  For example, the following
should print 123:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    my $x = 123;
\&    sub tmp { sub { eval \*(Aq$x\*(Aq } }
\&    my $a = tmp();
\&    undef &tmp;
\&    print  $a\->();

during compilation.  Once it is compiled and \f(CW\*(C`CvROOT\*(C'\fR attached, it has

Creates a new \f(CW\*(C`refcounted_he\*(C'\fR.  This consists of a single key/value
pair and a reference to an existing \f(CW\*(C`refcounted_he\*(C'\fR chain (which may

by this function and will become part of the constructed subroutine.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`proto\*(C'\fR specifies the subroutine's prototype, unless one is supplied
as an attribute (see below).  If \f(CW\*(C`proto\*(C'\fR is null, then the subroutine
will not have a prototype.  If \f(CW\*(C`proto\*(C'\fR is non-null, it must point to a
\&\f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR op whose value is a string, and the subroutine will have that
string as its prototype.  If a prototype is supplied as an attribute, the
attribute takes precedence over \f(CW\*(C`proto\*(C'\fR, but in that case \f(CW\*(C`proto\*(C'\fR should
preferably be null.  In any case, \f(CW\*(C`proto\*(C'\fR is consumed by this function.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`attrs\*(C'\fR supplies attributes to be applied the subroutine.  A handful of
attributes take effect by built-in means, being applied to \f(CW\*(C`PL_compcv\*(C'\fR
immediately when seen.  Other attributes are collected up and attached
to the subroutine by this route.  \f(CW\*(C`attrs\*(C'\fR may be null to supply no
attributes, or point to a \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR op for a single attribute, or point
to a \f(CW\*(C`list\*(C'\fR op whose children apart from the \f(CW\*(C`pushmark\*(C'\fR are \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR
ops for one or more attributes.  Each \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR op must be a string,
giving the attribute name optionally followed by parenthesised arguments,
in the manner in which attributes appear in Perl source.  The attributes
will be applied to the sub by this function.  \f(CW\*(C`attrs\*(C'\fR is consumed by
this function.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`o_is_gv\*(C'\fR is false and \f(CW\*(C`o\*(C'\fR is null, then the subroutine will
be anonymous.  If \f(CW\*(C`o_is_gv\*(C'\fR is false and \f(CW\*(C`o\*(C'\fR is non-null, then \f(CW\*(C`o\*(C'\fR
must point to a \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR op, which will be consumed by this function,
and its string value supplies a name for the subroutine.  The name may
be qualified or unqualified, and if it is unqualified then a default
stash will be selected in some manner.  If \f(CW\*(C`o_is_gv\*(C'\fR is true, then \f(CW\*(C`o\*(C'\fR
doesn't point to an \f(CW\*(C`OP\*(C'\fR at all, but is instead a cast pointer to a \f(CW\*(C`GV\*(C'\fR
by which the subroutine will be named.
.Sp
If there is already a subroutine of the specified name, then the new
sub will either replace the existing one in the glob or be merged with
the existing one.  A warning may be generated about redefinition.
.Sp
If the subroutine has one of a few special names, such as \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR, then it will be claimed by the appropriate queue for automatic
running of phase-related subroutines.  In this case the relevant glob will
be left not containing any subroutine, even if it did contain one before.
In the case of \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR, the subroutine will be executed and the reference
to it disposed of before this function returns.
.Sp
The function returns a pointer to the constructed subroutine.  If the sub
is anonymous then ownership of one counted reference to the subroutine
is transferred to the caller.  If the sub is named then the caller does
not get ownership of a reference.  In most such cases, where the sub
has a non-phase name, the sub will be alive at the point it is returned
by virtue of being contained in the glob that names it.  A phase-named
subroutine will usually be alive by virtue of the reference owned by the
phase's automatic run queue.  But a \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR subroutine, having already
been executed, will quite likely have been destroyed already by the
time this function returns, making it erroneous for the caller to make
any use of the returned pointer.  It is the caller's responsibility to
ensure that it knows which of these situations applies.

.IX Item "newXS_len_flags"
Construct an \s-1XS\s0 subroutine, also performing some surrounding jobs.
.Sp
The subroutine will have the entry point \f(CW\*(C`subaddr\*(C'\fR.  It will have
the prototype specified by the nul-terminated string \f(CW\*(C`proto\*(C'\fR, or
no prototype if \f(CW\*(C`proto\*(C'\fR is null.  The prototype string is copied;
the caller can mutate the supplied string afterwards.  If \f(CW\*(C`filename\*(C'\fR
is non-null, it must be a nul-terminated filename, and the subroutine
will have its \f(CW\*(C`CvFILE\*(C'\fR set accordingly.  By default \f(CW\*(C`CvFILE\*(C'\fR is set to
point directly to the supplied string, which must be static.  If \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR
has the \f(CW\*(C`XS_DYNAMIC_FILENAME\*(C'\fR bit set, then a copy of the string will
be taken instead.
.Sp
Other aspects of the subroutine will be left in their default state.
If anything else needs to be done to the subroutine for it to function
correctly, it is the caller's responsibility to do that after this
function has constructed it.  However, beware of the subroutine
potentially being destroyed before this function returns, as described
below.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR is null then the subroutine will be anonymous, with its
\&\f(CW\*(C`CvGV\*(C'\fR referring to an \f(CW\*(C`_\|_ANON_\|_\*(C'\fR glob.  If \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR is non-null then the
subroutine will be named accordingly, referenced by the appropriate glob.
\&\f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR is a string of length \f(CW\*(C`len\*(C'\fR bytes giving a sigilless symbol name,
in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 if \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR has the \f(CW\*(C`SVf_UTF8\*(C'\fR bit set and in Latin\-1 otherwise.
The name may be either qualified or unqualified, with the stash defaulting
in the same manner as for \f(CW\*(C`gv_fetchpvn_flags\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR may contain
flag bits understood by \f(CW\*(C`gv_fetchpvn_flags\*(C'\fR with the same meaning as
they have there, such as \f(CW\*(C`GV_ADDWARN\*(C'\fR.  The symbol is always added to
the stash if necessary, with \f(CW\*(C`GV_ADDMULTI\*(C'\fR semantics.
.Sp
If there is already a subroutine of the specified name, then the new sub
will replace the existing one in the glob.  A warning may be generated
about the redefinition.  If the old subroutine was \f(CW\*(C`CvCONST\*(C'\fR then the
decision about whether to warn is influenced by an expectation about
whether the new subroutine will become a constant of similar value.
That expectation is determined by \f(CW\*(C`const_svp\*(C'\fR.  (Note that the call to
this function doesn't make the new subroutine \f(CW\*(C`CvCONST\*(C'\fR in any case;
that is left to the caller.)  If \f(CW\*(C`const_svp\*(C'\fR is null then it indicates
that the new subroutine will not become a constant.  If \f(CW\*(C`const_svp\*(C'\fR
is non-null then it indicates that the new subroutine will become a
constant, and it points to an \f(CW\*(C`SV*\*(C'\fR that provides the constant value
that the subroutine will have.
.Sp
If the subroutine has one of a few special names, such as \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR, then it will be claimed by the appropriate queue for automatic
running of phase-related subroutines.  In this case the relevant glob will
be left not containing any subroutine, even if it did contain one before.
In the case of \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR, the subroutine will be executed and the reference
to it disposed of before this function returns, and also before its
prototype is set.  If a \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR subroutine would not be sufficiently
constructed by this function to be ready for execution then the caller
must prevent this happening by giving the subroutine a different name.
.Sp
The function returns a pointer to the constructed subroutine.  If the sub
is anonymous then ownership of one counted reference to the subroutine
is transferred to the caller.  If the sub is named then the caller does
not get ownership of a reference.  In most such cases, where the sub
has a non-phase name, the sub will be alive at the point it is returned
by virtue of being contained in the glob that names it.  A phase-named
subroutine will usually be alive by virtue of the reference owned by the
phase's automatic run queue.  But a \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR subroutine, having already
been executed, will quite likely have been destroyed already by the

.IX Header "SV Manipulation Functions"
An \s-1SV\s0 (or \s-1AV, HV,\s0 etc.) is allocated in two parts: the head (struct
sv, av, hv...) contains type and reference count information, and for
many types, a pointer to the body (struct xrv, xpv, xpviv...), which
contains fields specific to each type.  Some types store all they need
in the head, so don't have a body.
.PP
In all but the most memory-paranoid configurations (ex: \s-1PURIFY\s0), heads
and bodies are allocated out of arenas, which by default are
approximately 4K chunks of memory parcelled up into N heads or bodies.
Sv-bodies are allocated by their sv-type, guaranteeing size
consistency needed to allocate safely from arrays.
.PP
For SV-heads, the first slot in each arena is reserved, and holds a
link to the next arena, some flags, and a note of the number of slots.
Snaked through each arena chain is a linked list of free items; when
this becomes empty, an extra arena is allocated and divided up into N
items which are threaded into the free list.
.PP
SV-bodies are similar, but they use arena-sets by default, which
separate the link and info from the arena itself, and reclaim the 1st
slot in the arena.  SV-bodies are further described later.

The following global variables are associated with arenas:

.PP
A few special \s-1SV\s0 heads are not allocated from an arena, but are
instead directly created in the interpreter structure, eg PL_sv_undef.
The size of arenas can be changed from the default by setting
\&\s-1PERL_ARENA_SIZE\s0 appropriately at compile time.
.PP
The \s-1SV\s0 arena serves the secondary purpose of allowing still-live SVs
to be located and destroyed during final cleanup.
.PP
At the lowest level, the macros \fBnew_SV()\fR and \fBdel_SV()\fR grab and free
an \s-1SV\s0 head.  (If debugging with \-DD, \fBdel_SV()\fR calls the function \fBS_del_sv()\fR
to return the \s-1SV\s0 to the free list with error checking.) \fBnew_SV()\fR calls
\&\fBmore_sv()\fR / \fBsv_add_arena()\fR to add an extra arena if the free list is empty.
SVs in the free list have their SvTYPE field set to all ones.
.PP
At the time of very final cleanup, \fBsv_free_arenas()\fR is called from
\&\fBperl_destruct()\fR to physically free all the arenas allocated since the
start of the interpreter.
.PP
The function \fBvisit()\fR scans the \s-1SV\s0 arenas list, and calls a specified
function for each \s-1SV\s0 it finds which is still live \- ie which has an SvTYPE
other than all 1's, and a non-zero SvREFCNT. \fBvisit()\fR is used by the
following functions (specified as [function that calls \fBvisit()\fR] / [function
called by \fBvisit()\fR for each \s-1SV\s0]):

For example, if your scalar is a reference and you want to modify the \f(CW\*(C`SvIVX\*(C'\fR

Find the name of the undefined variable (if any) that caused the operator
to issue a \*(L"Use of uninitialized value\*(R" warning.
If match is true, only return a name if its value matches \f(CW\*(C`uninit_sv\*(C'\fR.
So roughly speaking, if a unary operator (such as \f(CW\*(C`OP_COS\*(C'\fR) generates a
warning, then following the direct child of the op may yield an

Returns a bool as to whether or not the sequence of bytes from \f(CW\*(C`s\*(C'\fR up to but

sequence starting at \f(CW\*(C`s\*(C'\fR is to be treated as \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  To be precise, except for
two degenerate cases given below, this function returns \s-1TRUE\s0 iff all code
points in it come from any combination of three \*(L"scripts\*(R" given by the Unicode
\&\*(L"Script Extensions\*(R" property: Common, Inherited, and possibly one other.
Additionally all decimal digits must come from the same consecutive sequence of
10.
.Sp
For example, if all the characters in the sequence are Greek, or Common, or
Inherited, this function will return \s-1TRUE,\s0 provided any decimal digits in it
are from the same block of digits in Common.  (These are the \s-1ASCII\s0 digits
\&\*(L"0\*(R"..\*(L"9\*(R" and additionally a block for full width forms of these, and several
others used in mathematical notation.)   For scripts (unlike Greek) that have
their own digits defined this will accept either digits from that set or from
one of the Common digit sets, but not a combination of the two.  Some scripts,
such as Arabic, have more than one set of digits.  All digits must come from
the same set for this function to return \s-1TRUE.\s0

If the sequence is empty, \s-1TRUE\s0 is returned, but \f(CW*ret_script\fR (if asked for)
will be \f(CW\*(C`SCX_INVALID\*(C'\fR.

If the sequence contains a single code point which is unassigned to a character
in the version of Unicode being used, the function will return \s-1TRUE,\s0 and the
script will be \f(CW\*(C`SCX_Unknown\*(C'\fR.  Any other combination of unassigned code points
in the input sequence will result in the function treating the input as not
being a script run.
.Sp
The returned script will be \f(CW\*(C`SCX_Inherited\*(C'\fR iff all the code points in it are
from the Inherited script.

Otherwise, the returned script will be \f(CW\*(C`SCX_Common\*(C'\fR iff all the code points in

This function looks at the sequence of bytes between \f(CW\*(C`s\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`e\*(C'\fR, which are
assumed to be encoded in ASCII/Latin1, and returns how many of them would
change should the string be translated into \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  Due to the nature of \s-1UTF\-8,\s0
each of these would occupy two bytes instead of the single one in the input
string.  Thus, this function returns the precise number of bytes the string
would expand by when translated to \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
.Sp
Unlike most of the other functions that have \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR in their name, the input

.IX Subsection "Set proper umask before calling mkstemp(3)"
In 5.22.0 perl started setting umask to \f(CW0600\fR before calling \f(CWmkstemp(3)\fR
and restoring it afterwards.  This wrongfully tells \f(CWopen(2)\fR to strip the
owner read and write bits from the given mode before applying it, rather than
the intended negation of leaving only those bits in place.
.PP
Systems that use mode \f(CW0666\fR in \f(CWmkstemp(3)\fR (like old versions of glibc)
create a file with permissions \f(CW0066\fR, leaving world read and write permissions
regardless of current umask.
.PP
This has been fixed by using umask \f(CW0177\fR instead.

Previously, if an environment variable appeared more than once in \f(CW\*(C`environ[]\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW%ENV\fR would contain the last entry for that name, while a
typical \f(CW\*(C`getenv()\*(C'\fR would return the first entry.  We now make sure \f(CW%ENV\fR
contains the same as what \f(CW\*(C`getenv()\*(C'\fR returns.
.PP
Secondly, we now remove duplicates from \f(CW\*(C`environ[]\*(C'\fR, so if a setting with that

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for

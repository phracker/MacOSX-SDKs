.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This tool is a command-line client for the DBI::ProfileData.  It
allows you to analyze the profile data file produced by
DBI::ProfileDumper and produce various useful reports.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
This program accepts the following options:
.IP "\-\-number N" 4
.IX Item "--number N"
Produce this many items in the report.  Defaults to 10.  If set to
\&\*(L"all\*(R" then all results are shown.
.IP "\-\-sort field" 4
.IX Item "--sort field"
Sort results by the given field. Sorting by multiple fields isn't currently
supported (patches welcome).  The available sort fields are:
.RS 4
.IP "total" 4
.IX Item "total"
Sorts by total time run time across all runs.  This is the default
sort.
.IP "longest" 4
.IX Item "longest"
Sorts by the longest single run.
.IP "count" 4
.IX Item "count"
Sorts by total number of runs.
.IP "first" 4
.IX Item "first"
Sorts by the time taken in the first run.
.IP "shortest" 4
.IX Item "shortest"
Sorts by the shortest single run.
.IP "key1" 4
.IX Item "key1"
Sorts by the value of the first element in the Path, which should be numeric.
You can also sort by \f(CW\*(C`key2\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`key3\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\-\-reverse" 4
.IX Item "--reverse"
Reverses the selected sort.  For example, to see a report of the
shortest overall time:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-sort total \-\-reverse
.Ve
.IP "\-\-match keyN=value" 4
.IX Item "--match keyN=value"
Consider only items where the specified key matches the given value.
Keys are numbered from 1.  For example, let's say you used a
DBI::Profile Path of:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  [ DBIprofile_Statement, DBIprofile_Methodname ]
.Ve
.Sp
And called dbiprof as in:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key2=execute
.Ve
.Sp
Your report would only show execute queries, leaving out prepares,
fetches, etc.
.Sp
If the value given starts and ends with slashes (\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR) then it will be
treated as a regular expression.  For example, to only include \s-1SELECT\s0
queries where key1 is the statement:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key1=/^SELECT/
.Ve
.Sp
By default the match expression is matched case-insensitively, but
this can be changed with the \-\-case\-sensitive option.
.IP "\-\-exclude keyN=value" 4
.IX Item "--exclude keyN=value"
Remove items for where the specified key matches the given value.  For
example, to exclude all prepare entries where key2 is the method name:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-exclude key2=prepare
.Ve
.Sp
Like \f(CW\*(C`\-\-match\*(C'\fR, If the value given starts and ends with slashes
(\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR) then it will be treated as a regular expression.  For example,
to exclude \s-1UPDATE\s0 queries where key1 is the statement:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbiprof \-\-match key1=/^UPDATE/
.Ve
.Sp
By default the exclude expression is matched case-insensitively, but
this can be changed with the \-\-case\-sensitive option.
.IP "\-\-case\-sensitive" 4
.IX Item "--case-sensitive"
Using this option causes \-\-match and \-\-exclude to work
case-sensitively.  Defaults to off.
.IP "\-\-delete" 4
.IX Item "--delete"
Sets the \f(CW\*(C`DeleteFiles\*(C'\fR option to DBI::ProfileData which causes the
files to be deleted after reading. See DBI::ProfileData for more details.
.IP "\-\-dumpnodes" 4
.IX Item "--dumpnodes"
Print the list of nodes in the form of a perl data structure.
Use the \f(CW\*(C`\-sort\*(C'\fR option if you want the list sorted.
.IP "\-\-version" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Print the dbiprof version number and exit.

.IX Subsection ".proverc"
If \fI~/.proverc\fR or \fI./.proverc\fR exist they will be read and any
options they contain processed before the command line options. Options
in \fI.proverc\fR are specified in the same way as command line options:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # .proverc
\&    \-\-state=hot,fast,save
\&    \-j9
.Ve
.PP
Additional option files may be specified with the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rc\*(C'\fR option.
Default option file processing is disabled by the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-norc\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
Under Windows and \s-1VMS\s0 the option file is named \fI_proverc\fR rather than
\&\fI.proverc\fR and is sought only in the current directory.
.ie n .SS "Reading from ""STDIN"""
.el .SS "Reading from \f(CWSTDIN\fP"
.IX Subsection "Reading from STDIN"
If you have a list of tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to test) in a
file, you can add them to your tests by using a '\-':
.PP
.Vb 1
\& prove \- < my_list_of_things_to_test.txt
.Ve
.PP
See the \f(CW\*(C`README\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`examples\*(C'\fR directory of this distribution.
.SS "Default Test Directory"
.IX Subsection "Default Test Directory"
If no files or directories are supplied, \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR looks for all files
matching the pattern \f(CW\*(C`t/*.t\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Colored Test Output"
.IX Subsection "Colored Test Output"
Colored test output using TAP::Formatter::Color is the default, but
if output is not to a terminal, color is disabled. You can override this by
adding the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-color\*(C'\fR switch.
.PP
Color support requires Term::ANSIColor and, on windows platforms, also
Win32::Console::ANSI. If the necessary module(s) are not installed
colored output will not be available.
.SS "Exit Code"
.IX Subsection "Exit Code"
If the tests fail \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR will exit with non-zero status.
.SS "Arguments to Tests"
.IX Subsection "Arguments to Tests"
It is possible to supply arguments to tests. To do so separate them from
prove's own arguments with the arisdottle, '::'. For example
.PP
.Vb 1
\& prove \-v t/mytest.t :: \-\-url http://example.com
.Ve
.PP
would run \fIt/mytest.t\fR with the options '\-\-url http://example.com'.
When running multiple tests they will each receive the same arguments.
.ie n .SS """\-\-exec"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-exec\fP"
.IX Subsection "--exec"
Normally you can just pass a list of Perl tests and the harness will know how
to execute them.  However, if your tests are not written in Perl or if you
want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-exec\*(C'\fR
switch:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/usr/bin/ruby \-w\*(Aq t/
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/usr/bin/perl \-Tw \-mstrict \-Ilib\*(Aq t/
\& prove \-\-exec \*(Aq/path/to/my/customer/exec\*(Aq
.Ve
.ie n .SS """\-\-merge"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-merge\fP"
.IX Subsection "--merge"
If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct
order relative to test results you can use the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-merge\*(C'\fR option to
merge the test scripts' \s-1STDERR\s0 into their \s-1STDOUT.\s0
.PP
This guarantees that \s-1STDOUT\s0 (where the test results appear) and \s-1STDERR\s0
(where the diagnostics appear) will stay in sync. The harness will
display any diagnostics your tests emit on \s-1STDERR.\s0
.PP
Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything
that appears on \s-1STDERR\s0 looks like a test result the test harness will
get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences
and can live with the risk.
.ie n .SS """\-\-trap"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-trap\fP"
.IX Subsection "--trap"
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-trap\*(C'\fR option will attempt to trap \s-1SIGINT\s0 (Ctrl-C) during a test
run and display the test summary even if the run is interrupted
.ie n .SS """\-\-state"""
.el .SS "\f(CW\-\-state\fP"
.IX Subsection "--state"
You can ask \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR to remember the state of previous test runs and
select and/or order the tests to be run based on that saved state.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-state\*(C'\fR switch requires an argument which must be a comma
separated list of one or more of the following options.
.ie n .IP """last""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWlast\fR" 4
.IX Item "last"
Run the same tests as the last time the state was saved. This makes it
possible, for example, to recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Run all tests in random order
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=save \-\-shuffle
\&
\&    # Run them again in the same order
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=last

Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful to make sure that no
new problems have been introduced.
.ie n .IP """all""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWall\fR" 4
.IX Item "all"
Run all tests in normal order. Multple options may be specified, so to
run all tests with the failures from last time first:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=failed,all,save
.Ve
.ie n .IP """hot""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWhot\fR" 4
.IX Item "hot"
Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure time of
each test is stored. The \f(CW\*(C`hot\*(C'\fR option causes tests to be run in most\-recent\-
failure order.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot,save
.Ve
.Sp
Tests that have never failed will not be selected. To run all tests with
the most recently failed first use
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot,all,save
.Ve
.Sp

.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=adrian

.IX Item "slow"
Run the tests in slowest to fastest order. This is useful in conjunction
with the \f(CW\*(C`\-j\*(C'\fR parallel testing switch to ensure that your slowest tests
start running first.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=slow \-j9

.IX Item "old"
Run the tests in oldest to newest order.
.ie n .IP """fresh""" 4

.IX Item "fresh"
Run those test scripts that have been modified since the last test run.
.ie n .IP """save""" 4

.IX Item "save"
Save the state on exit. The state is stored in a file called \fI.prove\fR
(\fI_prove\fR on Windows and \s-1VMS\s0) in the current directory.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-state\*(C'\fR switch may be used more than once.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ prove \-b \-\-state=hot \-\-state=all,save
.Ve
.SS "\-\-rules"
.IX Subsection "--rules"
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rules\*(C'\fR option is used to control which tests are run sequentially and
which are run in parallel, if the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-jobs\*(C'\fR option is specified. The option may
be specified multiple times, and the order matters.
.PP
The most practical use is likely to specify that some tests are not
\&\*(L"parallel-ready\*(R".  Since mentioning a file with \-\-rules doesn't cause it to
be selected to run as a test, you can \*(L"set and forget\*(R" some rules preferences in
your .proverc file. Then you'll be able to take maximum advantage of the
performance benefits of parallel testing, while some exceptions are still run
in parallel.
.PP
\fI\-\-rules examples\fR

\&\*(L"First match wins\*(R". The first rule that matches a test will be the one that applies.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Any test which does not match a rule will be run in sequence at the end of the run.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The existence of a rule does not imply selecting a test. You must still specify the tests to run.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Specifying a rule to allow tests to run in parallel does not make them run in parallel. You still need specify the number of parallel \f(CW\*(C`jobs\*(C'\fR in your Harness object.
.PP
\fI\-\-rules Glob-style pattern matching\fR
.IX Subsection "--rules Glob-style pattern matching"
.PP
We implement our own glob-style pattern matching for \-\-rules. Here are the
supported patterns:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    ** is any number of characters, including /, within a pathname
\&    * is zero or more characters within a filename/directory name
\&    ? is exactly one character within a filename/directory name
\&    {foo,bar,baz} is any of foo, bar or baz.
\&    \e is an escape character
.Ve
.PP
\fIMore advanced specifications for parallel vs sequence run rules\fR
.IX Subsection "More advanced specifications for parallel vs sequence run rules"
.PP
If you need more advanced management of what runs in parallel vs in sequence, see
the associated 'rules' documentation in TAP::Harness and TAP::Parser::Scheduler.
If what's possible directly through \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR is not sufficient, you can write your own
harness to access these features directly.
.ie n .SS "@INC"
.el .SS "\f(CW@INC\fP"
.IX Subsection "@INC"
prove introduces a separation between \*(L"options passed to the perl which
runs prove\*(R" and \*(L"options passed to the perl which runs tests\*(R"; this
distinction is by design. Thus the perl which is running a test starts
with the default \f(CW@INC\fR. Additional library directories can be added
via the \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR environment variable, via \-Ifoo in \f(CW\*(C`PERL5OPT\*(C'\fR or
via the \f(CW\*(C`\-Ilib\*(C'\fR option to \fIprove\fR.
.SS "Taint Mode"
.IX Subsection "Taint Mode"
Normally when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR environment variable do not appear in \f(CW@INC\fR.
.PP
Because \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR is often used during testing to add build
directories to \f(CW@INC\fR prove passes the names of any directories found
in \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR as \-I switches. The net effect of this is that
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR is honoured even when prove is run in taint mode.

\&\f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR. If an option can take multiple values, just specify it multiple times,
as with the \f(CW\*(C`extensions=\*(C'\fR examples above. If the option should be a hash
reference, specify the value as a second pair separated by a \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, as in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`pset=\*(C'\fR examples above (escape \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR with a backslash).
.PP
All \f(CW\*(C`\-\-sources\*(C'\fR are combined into a hash, and passed to \*(L"new\*(R" in TAP::Harness's
\&\f(CW\*(C`sources\*(C'\fR parameter.
.PP
See TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory for more details on how configuration is
passed to \fISourceHandlers\fR.

Plugins can be loaded using the \f(CW\*(C`\-P\f(CIplugin\f(CW\*(C'\fR syntax, eg:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  prove \-PMyPlugin
.Ve
.PP
This will search for a module named \f(CW\*(C`App::Prove::Plugin::MyPlugin\*(C'\fR, or failing
that, \f(CW\*(C`MyPlugin\*(C'\fR.  If the plugin can't be found, \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR will complain & exit.
.PP
You can pass arguments to your plugin by appending \f(CW\*(C`=arg1,arg2,etc\*(C'\fR to the
plugin name:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  prove \-PMyPlugin=fou,du,fafa
.Ve
.PP
Please check individual plugin documentation for more details.

Due to a mistake in the string-copying logic, copying the value of a state

introduced in Perl 5.20, would happen mostly for long strings (1250 chars or
more), but could happen for any strings under builds with copy-on-write
disabled.

On Win32, restoring in a child pseudo-process a variable that was \f(CW\*(C`local()\*(C'\fRed
in a parent pseudo-process before the \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR happened caused memory corruption
and a crash in the child pseudo-process (and therefore \s-1OS\s0 process).

Calling \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR on a format with a \f(CW\*(C`^**\*(C'\fR field could produce a panic in

In Perl 5.20.0, \f(CW\*(C`sort CORE::fake\*(C'\fR where 'fake' is anything other than a
keyword started chopping of the last 6 characters and treating the result as a
sort sub name.  The previous behaviour of treating \*(L"CORE::fake\*(R" as a sort sub
name has been restored.
[perl #123410] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123410>
.IP "\(bu" 4
A bug in regular expression patterns that could lead to segfaults and other
crashes has been fixed.  This occurred only in patterns compiled with \f(CW"/i"\fR,
while taking into account the current \s-1POSIX\s0 locale (this usually means they
have to be compiled within the scope of \f(CW"use\ locale"\fR), and there must be
a string of at least 128 consecutive bytes to match.

Certain syntax errors in substitutions, such as \f(CW\*(C`s/${<>{})//\*(C'\fR, would
crash, and had done so since Perl 5.10.  (In some cases the crash did not start

[perl #123542] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123542>
.IP "\(bu" 4
A memory leak in some regular expressions, introduced in Perl 5.20.1, has been

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`formline("@...", "a");\*(C'\fR would crash.  The \f(CW\*(C`FF_CHECKNL\*(C'\fR case in

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ ,
the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on

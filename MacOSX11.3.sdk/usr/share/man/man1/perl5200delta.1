.SS "Experimental Subroutine signatures"
.IX Subsection "Experimental Subroutine signatures"
Declarative syntax to unwrap argument list into lexical variables.
\&\f(CW\*(C`sub foo ($a,$b) {...}\*(C'\fR checks the number of arguments and puts the
arguments into lexical variables.  Signatures are not equivalent to
the existing idiom of \f(CW\*(C`sub foo { my($a,$b) = @_; ... }\*(C'\fR.  Signatures
are only available by enabling a non-default feature, and generate
warnings about being experimental.  The syntactic clash with
prototypes is managed by disabling the short prototype syntax when
signatures are enabled.
.PP
See \*(L"Signatures\*(R" in perlsub for details.
.ie n .SS """sub""s now take a ""prototype"" attribute"
.el .SS "\f(CWsub\fPs now take a \f(CWprototype\fP attribute"
.IX Subsection "subs now take a prototype attribute"
When declaring or defining a \f(CW\*(C`sub\*(C'\fR, the prototype can now be specified inside
of a \f(CW\*(C`prototype\*(C'\fR attribute instead of in parens following the name.
.PP
For example, \f(CW\*(C`sub foo($$){}\*(C'\fR could be rewritten as
\&\f(CW\*(C`sub foo : prototype($$){}\*(C'\fR.
.SS "More consistent prototype parsing"
.IX Subsection "More consistent prototype parsing"
Multiple semicolons in subroutine prototypes have long been tolerated and
treated as a single semicolon.  There was one case where this did not
happen.  A subroutine whose prototype begins with \*(L"*\*(R" or \*(L";*\*(R" can affect
whether a bareword is considered a method name or sub call.  This now
applies also to \*(L";;;*\*(R".
.PP
Whitespace has long been allowed inside subroutine prototypes, so
\&\f(CW\*(C`sub( $ $ )\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`sub($$)\*(C'\fR, but until now it was stripped
when the subroutine was parsed.  Hence, whitespace was \fInot\fR allowed in
prototypes set by \f(CW\*(C`Scalar::Util::set_prototype\*(C'\fR.  Now it is permitted,
and the parser no longer strips whitespace.  This means
\&\f(CW\*(C`prototype &mysub\*(C'\fR returns the original prototype, whitespace and all.
.ie n .SS """rand"" now uses a consistent random number generator"
.el .SS "\f(CWrand\fP now uses a consistent random number generator"
.IX Subsection "rand now uses a consistent random number generator"
Previously perl would use a platform specific random number generator, varying
between the libc \fBrand()\fR, \fBrandom()\fR or \fBdrand48()\fR.
.PP
This meant that the quality of perl's random numbers would vary from platform
to platform, from the 15 bits of \fBrand()\fR on Windows to 48\-bits on \s-1POSIX\s0
platforms such as Linux with \fBdrand48()\fR.
.PP
Perl now uses its own internal \fBdrand48()\fR implementation on all platforms.  This
does not make perl's \f(CW\*(C`rand\*(C'\fR cryptographically secure.  [perl #115928]
.SS "New slice syntax"

The new \f(CW%hash{...}\fR and \f(CW%array[...]\fR syntax returns a list of key/value (or

.SS "Experimental Postfix Dereferencing"

Until this release, only single-byte locales, such as the \s-1ISO 8859\s0
series were supported.  Now, the increasingly common multi-byte \s-1UTF\-8\s0
locales are also supported.  A \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locale is one in which the

.ie n .SS """use\ locale"" now compiles on systems without locale ability"
.el .SS "\f(CWuse\ locale\fP now compiles on systems without locale ability"
.IX Subsection "uselocale now compiles on systems without locale ability"
Previously doing this caused the program to not compile.  Within its
scope the program behaves as if in the \*(L"C\*(R" locale.  Thus programs
written for platforms that support locales can run on locale-less
platforms without change.  Attempts to change the locale away from the
\&\*(L"C\*(R" locale will, of course, fail.
.SS "More locale initialization fallback options"
.IX Subsection "More locale initialization fallback options"
If there was an error with locales during Perl start-up, it immediately
gave up and tried to use the \f(CW"C"\fR locale.  Now it first tries using
other locales given by the environment variables, as detailed in
\&\*(L"\s-1ENVIRONMENT\*(R"\s0 in perllocale.  For example, if \f(CW\*(C`LC_ALL\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`LANG\*(C'\fR are
both set, and using the \f(CW\*(C`LC_ALL\*(C'\fR locale fails, Perl will now try the
\&\f(CW\*(C`LANG\*(C'\fR locale, and only if that fails, will it fall back to \f(CW"C"\fR.  On
Windows machines, Perl will try, ahead of using \f(CW"C"\fR, the system
default locale if all the locales given by environment variables fail.

Previously \fB\-F\fR without \fB\-a\fR was a no-op, and \fB\-a\fR without \fB\-n\fR or \fB\-p\fR
was a no-op, with this change, if you supply \fB\-F\fR then both \fB\-a\fR and \fB\-n\fR
are implied and if you supply \fB\-a\fR then \fB\-n\fR is implied.
.PP
You can still use \fB\-p\fR for its extra behaviour. [perl #116190]

The special variables \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR, used in \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR, are now exempt from \*(L"used

.PP
A literal \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR after \f(CW\*(C`\eB\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\eb\*(C'\fR is now fatal.
.PP
These were deprecated in perl v5.14.0.
.SS "Tainting happens under more circumstances; now conforms to documentation"
.IX Subsection "Tainting happens under more circumstances; now conforms to documentation"
This affects regular expression matching and changing the case of a
string (\f(CW\*(C`lc\*(C'\fR, \f(CW"\eU"\fR, \fIetc\fR.) within the scope of \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR.
The result is now tainted based on the operation, no matter what the
contents of the string were, as the documentation (perlsec,
\&\*(L"\s-1SECURITY\*(R"\s0 in perllocale) indicates it should.  Previously, for the case
change operation, if the string contained no characters whose case
change could be affected by the locale, the result would not be tainted.
For example, the result of \f(CW\*(C`uc()\*(C'\fR on an empty string or one containing
only above\-Latin1 code points is now tainted, and wasn't before.  This
leads to more consistent tainting results.  Regular expression patterns
taint their non-binary results (like \f(CW$&\fR, \f(CW$2\fR) if and only if the
pattern contains elements whose matching depends on the current
(potentially tainted) locale.  Like the case changing functions, the
actual contents of the string being matched now do not matter, whereas
formerly it did.  For example, if the pattern contains a \f(CW\*(C`\ew\*(C'\fR, the
results will be tainted even if the match did not have to use that
portion of the pattern to succeed or fail, because what a \f(CW\*(C`\ew\*(C'\fR matches
depends on locale.  However, for example, a \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR in a pattern will not
enable tainting, because the dot matches any single character, and what
the current locale is doesn't change in any way what matches and what
doesn't.
.ie n .SS """\ep{}"", ""\eP{}"" matching has changed for non-Unicode code points."
.el .SS "\f(CW\ep{}\fP, \f(CW\eP{}\fP matching has changed for non-Unicode code points."
.IX Subsection "p{}, P{} matching has changed for non-Unicode code points."
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eP{}\*(C'\fR are defined by Unicode only on Unicode-defined code
points (\f(CW\*(C`U+0000\*(C'\fR through \f(CW\*(C`U+10FFFF\*(C'\fR).  Their behavior on matching
these legal Unicode code points is unchanged, but there are changes for
code points \f(CW0x110000\fR and above.  Previously, Perl treated the result
of matching \f(CW\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eP{}\*(C'\fR against these as \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, which
translates into \*(L"false\*(R".  For \f(CW\*(C`\eP{}\*(C'\fR, this was then complemented into
\&\*(L"true\*(R".  A warning was supposed to be raised when this happened.
However, various optimizations could prevent the warning, and the
results were often counter-intuitive, with both a match and its seeming
complement being false.  Now all non-Unicode code points are treated as
typical unassigned Unicode code points.  This generally is more
Do-What-I-Mean.  A warning is raised only if the results are arguably
different from a strict Unicode approach, and from what Perl used to do.
Code that needs to be strictly Unicode compliant can make this warning
fatal, and then Perl always raises the warning.
.PP
Details are in \*(L"Beyond Unicode code points\*(R" in perlunicode.
.ie n .SS """\ep{All}"" has been expanded to match all possible code points"
.el .SS "\f(CW\ep{All}\fP has been expanded to match all possible code points"
.IX Subsection "p{All} has been expanded to match all possible code points"
The Perl-defined regular expression pattern element \f(CW\*(C`\ep{All}\*(C'\fR, unused
on \s-1CPAN,\s0 used to match just the Unicode code points; now it matches all
possible code points; that is, it is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`qr/./s\*(C'\fR.  Thus
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{All}\*(C'\fR is no longer synonymous with \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Any}\*(C'\fR, which continues to
match just the Unicode code points, as Unicode says it should.
.SS "Data::Dumper's output may change"
.IX Subsection "Data::Dumper's output may change"
Depending on the data structures dumped and the settings set for
Data::Dumper, the dumped output may have changed from previous

.PP
If you have tests that depend on the exact output of Data::Dumper,
they may fail.
.PP
To avoid this problem in your code, test against the data structure
from evaluating the dumped structure, instead of the dump itself.
.ie n .SS "Locale decimal point character no longer leaks outside of ""use\ locale"" scope"
.el .SS "Locale decimal point character no longer leaks outside of \f(CWuse\ locale\fP scope"
.IX Subsection "Locale decimal point character no longer leaks outside of uselocale scope"
This is actually a bug fix, but some code has come to rely on the bug
being present, so this change is listed here.  The current locale that
the program is running under is not supposed to be visible to Perl code
except within the scope of a \f(CW\*(C`use\ locale\*(C'\fR.  However, until now under
certain circumstances, the character used for a decimal point (often a
comma) leaked outside the scope.  If your code is affected by this
change, simply add a \f(CW\*(C`use\ locale\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Assignments of Windows sockets error codes to $! now prefer \fIerrno.h\fP values over \fBWSAGetLastError()\fP values"
.IX Subsection "Assignments of Windows sockets error codes to $! now prefer errno.h values over WSAGetLastError() values"
In previous versions of Perl, Windows sockets error codes as returned by
\&\fBWSAGetLastError()\fR were assigned to $!, and some constants such as \s-1ECONNABORTED,\s0
not in \fIerrno.h\fR in \s-1VC++\s0 (or the various Windows ports of gcc) were defined to
corresponding WSAE* values to allow $! to be tested against the E* constants
exported by Errno and \s-1POSIX\s0.
.PP
This worked well until \s-1VC++ 2010\s0 and later, which introduced new E* constants
with values > 100 into \fIerrno.h\fR, including some being (re)defined by perl
to WSAE* values.  That caused problems when linking \s-1XS\s0 code against other
libraries which used the original definitions of \fIerrno.h\fR constants.
.PP
To avoid this incompatibility, perl now maps WSAE* error codes to E* values
where possible, and assigns those values to $!.  The E* constants exported by
Errno and \s-1POSIX\s0 are updated to match so that testing $! against them,
wherever previously possible, will continue to work as expected, and all E*
constants found in \fIerrno.h\fR are now exported from those modules with their
original \fIerrno.h\fR values.
.PP
In order to avoid breakage in existing Perl code which assigns WSAE* values to
$!, perl now intercepts the assignment and performs the same mapping to E*
values as it uses internally when assigning to $! itself.
.PP
However, one backwards-incompatibility remains: existing Perl code which
compares $! against the numeric values of the WSAE* error codes that were
previously assigned to $! will now be broken in those cases where a
corresponding E* value has been assigned instead.  This is only an issue for
those E* values < 100, which were always exported from Errno and
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 with their original \fIerrno.h\fR values, and therefore could not be used
for WSAE* error code tests (e.g. \s-1WSAEINVAL\s0 is 10022, but the corresponding
\&\s-1EINVAL\s0 is 22).  (E* values > 100, if present, were redefined to WSAE*
values anyway, so compatibility can be achieved by using the E* constants,
which will work both before and after this change, albeit using different
numeric values under the hood.)

individual bytes that make up a UTF8\-encoded character, then use
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::encode()\*(C'\fR on the string (or a copy) first.
.SS "Literal control characters in variable names"
.IX Subsection "Literal control characters in variable names"
This deprecation affects things like $\ecT, where \ecT is a literal control (such
as a \f(CW\*(C`NAK\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE\*(C'\fR character) in
the source code.  Surprisingly, it appears that originally this was intended as
the canonical way of accessing variables like $^T, with the caret form only
being added as an alternative.
.PP
The literal control form is being deprecated for two main reasons.  It has what
are likely unfixable bugs, such as $\ecI not working as an alias for $^I, and
their usage not being portable to non-ASCII platforms: While $^T will work
everywhere, \ecT is whitespace in \s-1EBCDIC.\s0  [perl #119123]

.IX Subsection "References to non-integers and non-positive integers in $/"
Setting \f(CW$/\fR to a reference to zero or a reference to a negative integer is
now deprecated, and will behave \fBexactly\fR as though it was set to \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
If you want slurp behavior set \f(CW$/\fR to \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR explicitly.
.PP
Setting \f(CW$/\fR to a reference to a non integer is now forbidden and will
throw an error. Perl has never documented what would happen in this
context and while it used to behave the same as setting \f(CW$/\fR to
the address of the references in future it may behave differently, so we
have forbidden this usage.
.SS "Character matching routines in \s-1POSIX\s0"
.IX Subsection "Character matching routines in POSIX"
Use of any of these functions in the \f(CW\*(C`POSIX\*(C'\fR module is now deprecated:

functions are buggy and don't work on \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded strings.  See their
entries in \s-1POSIX\s0 for more information.
.PP
A warning is raised on the first call to any of them from each place in
the code that they are called.  (Hence a repeated statement in a loop
will raise just the one warning.)
.SS "Interpreter-based threads are now \fIdiscouraged\fP"
.IX Subsection "Interpreter-based threads are now discouraged"
The \*(L"interpreter-based threads\*(R" provided by Perl are not the fast, lightweight
system for multitasking that one might expect or hope for.  Threads are
implemented in a way that make them easy to misuse.  Few people know how to
use them correctly or will be able to provide help.
.PP
The use of interpreter-based threads in perl is officially
discouraged.
.SS "Module removals"
.IX Subsection "Module removals"
The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a

Distributions on \s-1CPAN\s0 which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.
.PP
The core versions of these modules will now issue \f(CW"deprecated"\fR\-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from \s-1CPAN.\s0
.PP
Note that the planned removal of these modules from core does not reflect a
judgement about the quality of the code and should not be taken as a suggestion
that their use be halted.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on
their necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl
installation, not on concerns over their design.

.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl has a new copy-on-write mechanism that avoids the need to copy the
internal string buffer when assigning from one scalar to another. This
makes copying large strings appear much faster.  Modifying one of the two
(or more) strings after an assignment will force a copy internally. This
makes it unnecessary to pass strings by reference for efficiency.
.Sp
This feature was already available in 5.18.0, but wasn't enabled by
default. It is the default now, and so you no longer need build perl with
the \fIConfigure\fR argument:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    \-Accflags=\-DPERL_NEW_COPY_ON_WRITE
.Ve
.Sp
It can be disabled (for now) in a perl build with:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    \-Accflags=\-DPERL_NO_COW
.Ve
.Sp
On some operating systems Perl can be compiled in such a way that any
attempt to modify string buffers shared by multiple SVs will crash.  This
way \s-1XS\s0 authors can test that their modules handle copy-on-write scalars
correctly.  See \*(L"Copy on Write\*(R" in perlguts for detail.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl has an optimizer for regular expression patterns.  It analyzes the pattern
to find things such as the minimum length a string has to be to match, etc.  It
now better handles code points that are above the Latin1 range.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Executing a regex that contains the \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR anchor (or its variant under the
\&\f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR flag) has been made much faster in several situations.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Precomputed hash values are now used in more places during method lookup.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Constant hash key lookups (\f(CW$hash{key}\fR as opposed to \f(CW$hash{$key}\fR) have
long had the internal hash value computed at compile time, to speed up
lookup.  This optimisation has only now been applied to hash slices as
well.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Combined \f(CW\*(C`and\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`or\*(C'\fR operators in void context, like those
generated for \f(CW\*(C`unless ($a && $b)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`if ($a || b)\*(C'\fR now
short circuit directly to the end of the statement. [perl #120128]
.IP "\(bu" 4
In certain situations, when \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR is the last statement in a subroutine's
main scope, it will be optimized out. This means code like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  sub baz { return $cat; }
.Ve
.Sp
will now behave like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  sub baz { $cat; }
.Ve
.Sp
which is notably faster.
.Sp
[perl #120765]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Code like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  my $x; # or @x, %x
\&  my $y;
.Ve
.Sp
is now optimized to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my ($x, $y);
.Ve
.Sp
In combination with the padrange optimization introduced in
v5.18.0, this means longer uninitialized my
variable statements are also optimized, so:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my $x; my @y; my %z;
.Ve
.Sp
becomes:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my ($x, @y, %z);
.Ve
.Sp
[perl #121077]
.IP "\(bu" 4
The creation of certain sorts of lists, including array and hash slices, is now
faster.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The optimisation for arrays indexed with a small constant integer is now
applied for integers in the range \-128..127, rather than 0..255. This should
speed up Perl code using expressions like \f(CW$x[\-1]\fR, at the expense of
(presumably much rarer) code using expressions like \f(CW$x[200]\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The first iteration over a large hash (using \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR) is now
faster. This is achieved by preallocating the hash's internal iterator
state, rather than lazily creating it when the hash is first iterated. (For
small hashes, the iterator is still created only when first needed. The
assumption is that small hashes are more likely to be used as objects, and
therefore never allocated. For large hashes, that's less likely to be true,
and the cost of allocating the iterator is swamped by the cost of allocating
space for the hash itself.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
When doing a global regex match on a string that came from the \f(CW\*(C`readline\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR operator, the data is no longer copied unnecessarily.
[perl #121259]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Dereferencing (as in \f(CW\*(C`$obj\->[0]\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`$obj\->{k}\*(C'\fR) is now faster
when \f(CW$obj\fR is an instance of a class that has overloaded methods, but
doesn't overload any of the dereferencing methods \f(CW\*(C`@{}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`%{}\*(C'\fR, and so on.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl's optimiser no longer skips optimising code that follows certain
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval {}\*(C'\fR expressions (including those with an apparent infinite loop).
.IP "\(bu" 4
The implementation now does a better job of avoiding meaningless work at
runtime. Internal effect-free \*(L"null\*(R" operations (created as a side-effect of
parsing Perl programs) are normally deleted during compilation. That
deletion is now applied in some situations that weren't previously handled.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl now does less disk I/O when dealing with Unicode properties that cover
up to three ranges of consecutive code points.

Starting in v5.14.0, it was possible to use push, pop, keys, and other
built-in functions not only on aggregate types, but on references to

specification, and now may become redundant to postfix dereferencing.
It has always been categorized as an experimental feature, and in

Attribute prototype(%s) discards earlier prototype attribute in same sub
.Sp
(W misc) A sub was declared as \f(CW\*(C`sub foo : prototype(A) : prototype(B) {}\*(C'\fR, for
example.  Since each sub can only have one prototype, the earlier
declaration(s) are discarded while the last one is applied.

Possible precedence issue with control flow operator

.Sp

Prototype '%s' overridden by attribute 'prototype(%s)' in \f(CW%s\fR

Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]
.Sp
(W syntax) In scalar context, you've used an array index/value slice (indicated
by %) to select a single element of an array.  Generally it's better to ask for
a scalar value (indicated by $).  The difference is that \f(CW$foo[&bar]\fR always
behaves like a scalar, both in the value it returns and when evaluating its
argument, while \f(CW%foo[&bar]\fR provides a list context to its subscript, which
can do weird things if you're expecting only one subscript.  When called in
list context, it also returns the index (what \f(CW&bar\fR returns) in addition to
the value.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Scalar value @%s{%s} better written as $%s{%s}
.Sp
(W syntax) In scalar context, you've used a hash key/value slice (indicated by

But what \f(CW%s\fR could be was mostly up to luck.  For \f(CW\*(C`(?(foobar))\*(C'\fR, you might have

This is a huge time saver if cross-compiling, but can also help

.IP "\(bu" 4
The cross-compilation model has been renovated.
There's several new options, and some backwards-incompatible changes:
.Sp
We now build binaries for miniperl and generate_uudmap to be used on the host,
rather than running every miniperl call on the target; this means that, short
of 'make test', we no longer need access to the target system once Configure is
done.  You can provide already-built binaries through the \f(CW\*(C`hostperl\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`hostgenerate\*(C'\fR options to Configure.
.Sp
Additionally, if targeting an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform from an \s-1ASCII\s0 host,
or viceversa, you'll need to run Configure with \f(CW\*(C`\-Uhostgenerate\*(C'\fR, to
indicate that generate_uudmap should be run on the target.
.Sp
Finally, there's also a way of having Configure end early, right after
building the host binaries, by cross-compiling without specifying a
\&\f(CW\*(C`targethost\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The incompatible changes include no longer using xconfig.h, xlib, or
Cross.pm, so canned config files and Makefiles will have to be updated.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Related to the above, there is now a way of specifying the location of sh
(or equivalent) on the target system: \f(CW\*(C`targetsh\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
For example, Android has its sh in /system/bin/sh, so if cross-compiling
from a more normal Unixy system with sh in /bin/sh, \*(L"targetsh\*(R" would end
up as /system/bin/sh, and \*(L"sh\*(R" as /bin/sh.

By default, \fBgcc\fR 4.9 does some optimizations that break perl.  The \fB\-fwrapv\fR

go away), \fIConfigure\fR now adds \fB\-fwrapv\fR unless the user requests

It is now possible to keep Perl from initializing locale handling.
For the most part, Perl doesn't pay attention to locale.  (See
perllocale.)  Nonetheless, until now, on startup, it has always
initialized locale handling to the system default, just in case the
program being executed ends up using locales.  (This is one of the first
things a locale-aware program should do, long before Perl knows if it
will actually be needed or not.)  This works well except when Perl is
embedded in another application which wants a locale that isn't the
system default.  Now, if the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT\*(C'\fR is set at the time Perl is started, this
initialization step is skipped.  Prior to this, on Windows platforms,
the only workaround for this deficiency was to use a hacked-up copy of
internal Perl code.  Applications that need to use older Perls can
discover if the embedded Perl they are using needs the workaround by
testing that the C preprocessor symbol \f(CW\*(C`HAS_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT\*(C'\fR is not
defined.  [\s-1RT\s0 #38193]

Perl's new copy-on-write mechanism  (which is now enabled by default),
allows any \f(CW\*(C`SvPOK\*(C'\fR scalar to be automatically upgraded to a copy-on-write

the string buffer itself.

Note that both scalars share the same \s-1PV\s0 buffer and have a \s-1COW_REFCNT\s0
greater than zero.
.Sp
This means that \s-1XS\s0 code which wishes to modify the \f(CW\*(C`SvPVX()\*(C'\fR buffer of an
\&\s-1SV\s0 should call \f(CW\*(C`SvPV_force()\*(C'\fR or similar first, to ensure a valid (and
unshared) buffer, and to call \f(CW\*(C`SvSETMAGIC()\*(C'\fR afterwards. This in fact has
always been the case (for example hash keys were already copy-on-write);
this change just spreads the \s-1COW\s0 behaviour to a wider variety of SVs.
.Sp
One important difference is that before 5.18.0, shared hash-key scalars
used to have the \f(CW\*(C`SvREADONLY\*(C'\fR flag set; this is no longer the case.

supports \f(CW\*(C`sv\*(C'\fR argument being non-NULL dates to 5.0 alpha 2 directly, and
indirectly to Perl 1.0 (pre 5.0 api). The lack of documentation that the
functions accepted a \s-1NULL\s0 \f(CW\*(C`sv\*(C'\fR was corrected in 5.11.0 and between 5.11.0

a \s-1NULL\s0 \f(CW\*(C`sv\*(C'\fR being passed to sv_2*v* functions, is if \s-1XS\s0 code defines its own
getter type Sv*V* macros, which check for \s-1NULL\s0 \fBbefore\fR dereferencing and

Changes in warnings raised by \f(CW\*(C`utf8n_to_uvchr()\*(C'\fR
.Sp
This bottom level function decodes the first character of a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 string
into a code point.  It is accessible to \f(CW\*(C`XS\*(C'\fR level code, but it's
discouraged from using it directly.  There are higher level functions
that call this that should be used instead, such as
\&\*(L"utf8_to_uvchr_buf\*(R" in perlapi.  For completeness though, this documents
some changes to it.  Now, tests for malformations are done before any
tests for other potential issues.  One of those issues involves code
points so large that they have never appeared in any official standard
(the current standard has scaled back the highest acceptable code point
from earlier versions).  It is possible (though not done in \s-1CPAN\s0) to
warn and/or forbid these code points, while accepting smaller code
points that are still above the legal Unicode maximum.  The warning
message for this now includes the code point if representable on the
machine.  Previously it always displayed raw bytes, which is what it
still does for non-representable code points.

Regexp engine changes that affect the pluggable regex engine interface
.Sp
Many flags that used to be exposed via regexp.h and used to populate the
extflags member of struct regexp have been removed. These fields were
technically private to Perl's own regexp engine and should not have been
exposed there in the first place.
.Sp
The affected flags are:
.Sp
.Vb 8

The \f(CW\*(C`SvPVbyte\*(C'\fR \s-1XS\s0 function has been fixed to work with tied scalars returning
something other than a string.  It used to return utf8 in those cases where
\&\f(CW\*(C`SvPV\*(C'\fR would.

Perl 5.18.0 inadvertently made \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR crash on dereferenced regular

\&\f(CW\*(C`reset\*(C'\fR with an argument no longer skips copy-on-write scalars, regular

read-only values, it no longer skips any array or hash with the same name.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`reset\*(C'\fR with an argument now skips scalars aliased to typeglobs
(\f(CW\*(C`for $z (*foo) { reset "z" }\*(C'\fR).  Previously it would corrupt memory or crash.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`ucfirst\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`lcfirst\*(C'\fR were not respecting the bytes pragma.  This was a
regression from Perl 5.12. [perl #117355]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Changes to \f(CW\*(C`UNIVERSAL::DESTROY\*(C'\fR now update \s-1DESTROY\s0 caches in all classes,
instead of causing classes that have already had objects destroyed to continue
using the old sub.  This was a regression in Perl 5.18. [perl #114864]
.IP "\(bu" 4
All known false-positive occurrences of the deprecation warning \*(L"Useless use of

removed. [perl #119101]
.IP "\(bu" 4
The value of $^E is now saved across signal handlers on Windows.  [perl #85104]
.IP "\(bu" 4
A lexical filehandle (as in \f(CW\*(C`open my $fh...\*(C'\fR) is usually given a name based on
the current package and the name of the variable, e.g. \*(L"main::$fh\*(R".  Under
recursion, the filehandle was losing the \*(L"$fh\*(R" part of the name.  This has been
fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Uninitialized values returned by XSUBs are no longer exempt from uninitialized
warnings.  [perl #118693]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`elsif ("")\*(C'\fR no longer erroneously produces a warning about void context.
[perl #118753]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Passing \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR to a subroutine now causes \f(CW@_\fR to contain the same read-only
undefined scalar that \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR returns.  Furthermore, \f(CW\*(C`exists $_[0]\*(C'\fR will now
return true if \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR was the first argument.  [perl #7508, #109726]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Passing a non-existent array element to a subroutine does not usually
autovivify it unless the subroutine modifies its argument.  This did not work
correctly with negative indices and with non-existent elements within the
array.  The element would be vivified immediately.  The delayed vivification
has been extended to work with those.  [perl #118691]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning references or globs to the scalar returned by $#foo after the \f(CW@foo\fR
array has been freed no longer causes assertion failures on debugging builds
and memory leaks on regular builds.
.IP "\(bu" 4
On 64\-bit platforms, large ranges like 1..1000000000000 no longer crash, but
eat up all your memory instead.  [perl #119161]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_DATA_\|_\*(C'\fR now puts the \f(CW\*(C`DATA\*(C'\fR handle in the right package, even if the
current package has been renamed through glob assignment.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`redo\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`exit\*(C'\fR unwind the scope,
it is possible for \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR recursively to call a subroutine or format that
is currently being exited.  It that case, sometimes the lexical variables
inside the sub would start out having values from the outer call, instead of
being undefined as they should.  This has been fixed.  [perl #119311]
.IP "\(bu" 4
${^MPEN} is no longer treated as a synonym for ${^MATCH}.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl now tries a little harder to return the correct line number in
\&\f(CW\*(C`(caller)[2]\*(C'\fR.  [perl #115768]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Line numbers inside multiline quote-like operators are now reported correctly.
[perl #3643]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`#line\*(C'\fR directives inside code embedded in quote-like operators are now
respected.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Line numbers are now correct inside the second here-doc when two here-doc
markers occur on the same line.
.IP "\(bu" 4
An optimization in Perl 5.18 made incorrect assumptions causing a bad
interaction with the Devel::CallParser \s-1CPAN\s0 module.  If the module was
loaded then lexical variables declared in separate statements following a
\&\f(CW\*(C`my(...)\*(C'\fR list might fail to be cleared on scope exit.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW&xsub\fR and \f(CW\*(C`goto &xsub\*(C'\fR calls now allow the called subroutine to autovivify
elements of \f(CW@_\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW&xsub\fR and \f(CW\*(C`goto &xsub\*(C'\fR no longer crash if *_ has been undefined and has no

\&\f(CW&xsub\fR and \f(CW\*(C`goto &xsub\*(C'\fR now work with tied \f(CW@_\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Overlong identifiers no longer cause a buffer overflow (and a crash).  They
started doing so in Perl 5.18.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The warning \*(L"Scalar value \f(CW@hash\fR{foo} better written as \f(CW$hash\fR{foo}\*(R" now produces
far fewer false positives.  In particular, \f(CW@hash{+function_returning_a_list}\fR

slices.  [perl #28380, #114024]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$! = EINVAL; waitpid(0, WNOHANG);\*(C'\fR no longer goes into an internal infinite

.IP "\(bu" 4
A possible segmentation fault in filehandle duplication has been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A subroutine in \f(CW@INC\fR can return a reference to a scalar containing the initial
contents of the file.  However, that scalar was freed prematurely if not
referenced elsewhere, giving random results.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR no longer returns values that the same statement has accumulated so
far, fixing amongst other things the long-standing bug that \f(CW\*(C`push @a, last\*(C'\fR
would try to return the \f(CW@a\fR, copying it like a scalar in the process and
resulting in the error, \*(L"Bizarre copy of \s-1ARRAY\s0 in last.\*(R"  [perl #3112]
.IP "\(bu" 4
In some cases, closing file handles opened to pipe to or from a process, which
had been duplicated into a standard handle, would call perl's internal waitpid
wrapper with a pid of zero.  With the fix for [perl #85228] this zero pid was
passed to \f(CW\*(C`waitpid\*(C'\fR, possibly blocking the process.  This wait for process
zero no longer occurs.  [perl #119893]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR used to ignore magic on the fourth (timeout) argument, leading to
effects such as \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR blocking indefinitely rather than the expected sleep
time.  This has now been fixed.  [perl #120102]
.IP "\(bu" 4
The class name in \f(CW\*(C`for my class $foo\*(C'\fR is now parsed correctly.  In the case of
the second character of the class name being followed by a digit (e.g. 'a1b')
this used to give the error \*(L"Missing $ on loop variable\*(R".  [perl #120112]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl 5.18.0 accidentally disallowed \f(CW\*(C`\-bareword\*(C'\fR under \f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`use integer\*(C'\fR.  This has been fixed.  [perl #120288]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-a\*(C'\fR at the start of a line (or a hyphen with any single letter that is
not a filetest operator) no longer produces an erroneous 'Use of \*(L"\-a\*(R"

.IP "\(bu" 4
Lvalue context is now properly propagated into bare blocks and \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR blocks in lvalue subroutines.  Previously, arrays and hashes would
sometimes incorrectly be flattened when returned in lvalue list context, or
\&\*(L"Bizarre copy\*(R" errors could occur.  [perl #119797]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Lvalue context is now propagated to the branches of \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR (and
their alphabetic equivalents, \f(CW\*(C`or\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`and\*(C'\fR).  This means
\&\f(CW\*(C`foreach (pos $x || pos $y) {...}\*(C'\fR now allows \f(CW\*(C`pos\*(C'\fR to be modified
through \f(CW$_\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`readline\*(C'\fR remember the last handle used; the former
for the special \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR filehandle, the latter for \f(CW\*(C`${^LAST_FH}\*(C'\fR.
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval "*foo if 0"\*(C'\fR where *foo was the last handle passed to \f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`readline\*(C'\fR could cause that handle to be forgotten if the
handle were not opened yet.  This has been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Various cases of \f(CW\*(C`delete $::{a}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`delete $::{ENV}\*(C'\fR etc. causing a crash
have been fixed.  [perl #54044]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Setting \f(CW$!\fR to \s-1EACCESS\s0 before calling \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR could affect

.IP "\(bu" 4
The \*(L"Can't use \e1 to mean \f(CW$1\fR in expression\*(R" warning message now only occurs

happen in code embedded in the left-hand side, or in any other quote-like
operator.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Blessing into a reference (\f(CW\*(C`bless $thisref, $thatref\*(C'\fR) has long been
disallowed, but magical scalars for the second like \f(CW$/\fR and those tied

.IP "\(bu" 4
Blessing into a reference was accidentally allowed in 5.18 if the class

disallowed once more, as in 5.16.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$x\->{key}\*(C'\fR where \f(CW$x\fR was declared as \f(CW\*(C`my Class $x\*(C'\fR no longer crashes

A nonexistent array element with a large index passed to a subroutine that
ties the array and then tries to access the element no longer results in a

Declaring a subroutine stub named \s-1NEGATIVE_INDICES\s0 no longer makes negative

Aliasing \s-1CORE::GLOBAL::\s0 functions to constants stopped working in Perl 5.10

When \f(CW\*(C`\`...\`\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`qx/.../\*(C'\fR calls a \f(CW\*(C`readpipe\*(C'\fR override, double-quotish
interpolation now happens, as is the case when there is no override.
Previously, the presence of an override would make these quote-like
operators act like \f(CW\*(C`q{}\*(C'\fR, suppressing interpolation.  [perl #115330]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`<<<\`...\`\*(C'\fR here-docs (with backticks as the delimiters) now call

\&\f(CW\*(C`&CORE::exit()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`&CORE::die()\*(C'\fR now respect vmsish hints.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Undefining a glob that triggers a \s-1DESTROY\s0 method that undefines the same
glob is now safe.  It used to produce \*(L"Attempt to free unreferenced glob

If subroutine redefinition (\f(CW\*(C`eval \*(Aqsub foo{}\*(Aq\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`newXS\*(C'\fR for \s-1XS\s0 code)

method assigns a subroutine to the same slot (\f(CW\*(C`*foo = sub {}\*(C'\fR), \f(CW$_[0]\fR
is no longer left pointing to a freed scalar.  Now \s-1DESTROY\s0 is delayed until
the new subroutine has been installed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
On Windows, perl no longer calls \fBCloseHandle()\fR on a socket handle.  This makes
debugging easier on Windows by removing certain irrelevant bad handle
exceptions.  It also fixes a race condition that made socket functions randomly
fail in a Perl process with multiple \s-1OS\s0 threads, and possible test failures in
\&\fIdist/IO/t/cachepropagate\-tcp.t\fR.  [perl #120091/118059]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Formats involving \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded strings, or strange vars like ties,
overloads, or stringified refs (and in recent
perls, pure \s-1NOK\s0 vars) would generally do the wrong thing in formats
when the var is treated as a string and repeatedly chopped, as in
\&\f(CW\*(C`^<<<~~\*(C'\fR and similar. This has now been resolved.

\&\f(CW\*(C`semctl(..., SETVAL, ...)\*(C'\fR would set the semaphore to the top

Perl 5.18 broke autoloading via \f(CW\*(C`\->SUPER::foo\*(C'\fR method calls by looking
up \s-1AUTOLOAD\s0 from the current package rather than the current package's

.IP "\(bu" 4
A longstanding bug causing \f(CW\*(C`do {} until CONSTANT\*(C'\fR, where the constant
holds a true value, to read unallocated memory has been resolved.  This

crashed intermittently. [perl #72406]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fix HP-UX \f(CW$!\fR failure. HP-UX \fBstrerror()\fR returns an empty string for an

indicating the code is for an unknown error.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Individually-tied elements of \f(CW@INC\fR (as in \f(CW\*(C`tie $INC[0]...\*(C'\fR) are now
handled correctly.  Formerly, whether a sub returned by such a tied element

.IP "\(bu" 4
An initial \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR at the beginning of a format argument line was always
interpreted as the beginning of a block prior to v5.18.  In Perl v5.18, it

whether it was supposed to be an anonymous hash constructor or a block
based on the contents.  Now the previous behavious has been restored.

Backticks (\f(CW\*(C` \`\` \*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C` qx// \*(C'\fR) combined with multiple threads on

Greg was well known for many good reasons. He was one of the organisers of
the first YAPC::Europe, which concluded with an unscheduled auction where he
frantically tried to raise extra money to avoid the conference making a
loss. It was Greg who mistakenly arrived for a london.pm meeting a week
late; some years later he was the one who sold the choice of official
meeting date at a YAPC::Europe auction, and eventually as glorious leader of
london.pm he got to inherit the irreverent confusion that he had created.

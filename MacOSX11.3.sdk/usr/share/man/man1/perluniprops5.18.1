.SH "NAME"
perluniprops \- Index of Unicode Version 6.2.0 character properties in Perl
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document provides information about the portion of the Unicode database
that deals with character properties, that is the portion that is defined on
single code points.  (\*(L"Other information in the Unicode data base\*(R"
below briefly mentions other data that Unicode provides.)
.PP
Perl can provide access to all non-provisional Unicode character properties,
though not all are enabled by default.  The omitted ones are the Unihan
properties (accessible via the \s-1CPAN\s0 module Unicode::Unihan) and certain
deprecated or Unicode-internal properties.  (An installation may choose to
recompile Perl's tables to change this.  See \*(L"Unicode character
properties that are \s-1NOT\s0 accepted by Perl\*(R".)
.PP
For most purposes, access to Unicode properties from the Perl core is through
regular expression matches, as described in the next section.
For some special purposes, and to access the properties that are not suitable
for regular expression matching, all the Unicode character properties that
Perl handles are accessible via the standard Unicode::UCD module, as
described in the section \*(L"Properties accessible through Unicode::UCD\*(R".
.PP
Perl also provides some additional extensions and short-cut synonyms
for Unicode properties.
.PP
This document merely lists all available properties and does not attempt to
explain what each property really means.  There is a brief description of each
Perl extension; see \*(L"Other Properties\*(R" in perlunicode for more information on
these.  There is some detail about Blocks, Scripts, General_Category,
and Bidi_Class in perlunicode, but to find out about the intricacies of the
official Unicode properties, refer to the Unicode standard.  A good starting
place is <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/>.
.PP
Note that you can define your own properties; see
\&\*(L"User-Defined Character Properties\*(R" in perlunicode.
.ie n .SH "Properties accessible through ""\ep{}"" and ""\eP{}"""
.el .SH "Properties accessible through \f(CW\ep{}\fP and \f(CW\eP{}\fP"
.IX Header "Properties accessible through p{} and P{}"
The Perl regular expression \f(CW\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eP{}\*(C'\fR constructs give access to
most of the Unicode character properties.  The table below shows all these
constructs, both single and compound forms.
.PP
\&\fBCompound forms\fR consist of two components, separated by an equals sign or a
colon.  The first component is the property name, and the second component is
the particular value of the property to match against, for example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{Script: Greek}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Script=Greek}\*(C'\fR both mean to match characters
whose Script property is Greek.
.PP
\&\fBSingle forms\fR, like \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Greek}\*(C'\fR, are mostly Perl-defined shortcuts for
their equivalent compound forms.  The table shows these equivalences.  (In our
example, \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Greek}\*(C'\fR is a just a shortcut for \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Script=Greek}\*(C'\fR.)
There are also a few Perl-defined single forms that are not shortcuts for a
compound form.  One such is \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Word}\*(C'\fR.  These are also listed in the table.
.PP
In parsing these constructs, Perl always ignores Upper/lower case differences
everywhere within the {braces}.  Thus \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Greek}\*(C'\fR means the same thing as
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{greek}\*(C'\fR.  But note that changing the case of the \f(CW"p"\fR or \f(CW"P"\fR before
the left brace completely changes the meaning of the construct, from \*(L"match\*(R"
(for \f(CW\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fR) to \*(L"doesn't match\*(R" (for \f(CW\*(C`\eP{}\*(C'\fR).  Casing in this document is
for improved legibility.
.PP
Also, white space, hyphens, and underscores are normally ignored
everywhere between the {braces}, and hence can be freely added or removed
even if the \f(CW\*(C`/x\*(C'\fR modifier hasn't been specified on the regular expression.
But a '\fBT\fR' at the beginning of an entry in the table below
means that tighter (stricter) rules are used for that entry:
.ie n .IP "Single form (""\ep{name}"") tighter rules:" 4
.el .IP "Single form (\f(CW\ep{name}\fR) tighter rules:" 4
.IX Item "Single form (p{name}) tighter rules:"
White space, hyphens, and underscores \s-1ARE\s0 significant
except for:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
white space adjacent to a non-word character
.IP "\(bu" 4
underscores separating digits in numbers
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
That means, for example, that you can freely add or remove white space
adjacent to (but within) the braces without affecting the meaning.
.RE
.ie n .IP "Compound form (""\ep{name=value}"" or ""\ep{name:value}"") tighter rules:" 4
.el .IP "Compound form (\f(CW\ep{name=value}\fR or \f(CW\ep{name:value}\fR) tighter rules:" 4
.IX Item "Compound form (p{name=value} or p{name:value}) tighter rules:"
The tighter rules given above for the single form apply to everything to the
right of the colon or equals; the looser rules still apply to everything to
the left.
.Sp
That means, for example, that you can freely add or remove white space
adjacent to (but within) the braces and the colon or equal sign.
.PP
Some properties are considered obsolete by Unicode, but still available.
There are several varieties of obsolescence:
.IP "Stabilized" 4
.IX Item "Stabilized"
A property may be stabilized.  Such a determination does not indicate
that the property should or should not be used; instead it is a declaration
that the property will not be maintained nor extended for newly encoded
characters.  Such properties are marked with an '\fBS\fR' in the
table.
.IP "Deprecated" 4
.IX Item "Deprecated"
A property may be deprecated, perhaps because its original intent
has been replaced by another property, or because its specification was
somehow defective.  This means that its use is strongly
discouraged, so much so that a warning will be issued if used, unless the
regular expression is in the scope of a \f(CW\*(C`no\ warnings\ \*(Aqdeprecated\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
statement.  A '\fBD\fR' flags each such entry in the table, and
the entry there for the longest, most descriptive version of the property will
give the reason it is deprecated, and perhaps advice.  Perl may issue such a
warning, even for properties that aren't officially deprecated by Unicode,
when there used to be characters or code points that were matched by them, but
no longer.  This is to warn you that your program may not work like it did on
earlier Unicode releases.
.Sp
A deprecated property may be made unavailable in a future Perl version, so it
is best to move away from them.
.Sp
A deprecated property may also be stabilized, but this fact is not shown.
.IP "Obsolete" 4
.IX Item "Obsolete"
Properties marked with an '\fBO\fR' in the table are considered (plain)
obsolete.  Generally this designation is given to properties that Unicode once
used for internal purposes (but not any longer).
.PP
Some Perl extensions are present for backwards compatibility and are
discouraged from being used, but are not obsolete.  An '\fBX\fR'
flags each such entry in the table.  Future Unicode versions may force
some of these extensions to be removed without warning, replaced by another
property with the same name that means something different.  Use the
equivalent shown instead.
.PP
Matches in the Block property have shortcuts that begin with \*(L"In_\*(R".  For
example, \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Block=Latin1}\*(C'\fR can be written as \f(CW\*(C`\ep{In_Latin1}\*(C'\fR.  For
backward compatibility, if there is no conflict with another shortcut, these
may also be written as \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Latin1}\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Is_Latin1}\*(C'\fR.  But, N.B., there
are numerous such conflicting shortcuts.  Use of these forms for Block is
discouraged, and are flagged as such, not only because of the potential
confusion as to what is meant, but also because a later release of Unicode may
preempt the shortcut, and your program would no longer be correct.  Use the
\&\*(L"In_\*(R" form instead to avoid this, or even more clearly, use the compound form,
e.g., \f(CW\*(C`\ep{blk:latin1}\*(C'\fR.  See \*(L"Blocks\*(R" in perlunicode for more information
about this.
.PP
The table below has two columns.  The left column contains the \f(CW\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fR
constructs to look up, possibly preceded by the flags mentioned above; and
the right column contains information about them, like a description, or
synonyms.  It shows both the single and compound forms for each property that
has them.  If the left column is a short name for a property, the right column
will give its longer, more descriptive name; and if the left column is the
longest name, the right column will show any equivalent shortest name, in both
single and compound forms if applicable.
.PP
The right column will also caution you if a property means something different
than what might normally be expected.
.PP
All single forms are Perl extensions; a few compound forms are as well, and
are noted as such.
.PP
Numbers in (parentheses) indicate the total number of code points matched by
the property.  For emphasis, those properties that match no code points at all
are listed as well in a separate section following the table.
.PP
Most properties match the same code points regardless of whether \f(CW"/i"\fR
case-insensitive matching is specified or not.  But a few properties are
affected.  These are shown with the notation
.PP
.Vb 1
\& (/i= other_property)
.Ve
.PP
in the second column.  Under case-insensitive matching they match the
same code pode points as the property \*(L"other_property\*(R".
.PP
There is no description given for most non-Perl defined properties (See
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/> for that).
.PP
For compactness, '\fB*\fR' is used as a wildcard instead of showing all possible
combinations.  For example, entries like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& \ep{Gc: *}                                  \ep{General_Category: *}
.Ve
.PP
mean that 'Gc' is a synonym for 'General_Category', and anything that is valid
for the latter is also valid for the former.  Similarly,
.PP
.Vb 1
\& \ep{Is_*}                                   \ep{*}
.Ve
.PP
means that if and only if, for example, \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Foo}\*(C'\fR exists, then
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{Is_Foo}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\ep{IsFoo}\*(C'\fR are also valid and all mean the same thing.
And similarly, \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Foo=Bar}\*(C'\fR means the same as \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Is_Foo=Bar}\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{IsFoo=Bar}\*(C'\fR.  \*(L"*\*(R" here is restricted to something not beginning with an
underscore.
.PP
Also, in binary properties, 'Yes', 'T', and 'True' are all synonyms for 'Y'.
And 'No', 'F', and 'False' are all synonyms for 'N'.  The table shows 'Y*' and
\&'N*' to indicate this, and doesn't have separate entries for the other
possibilities.  Note that not all properties which have values 'Yes' and 'No'
are binary, and they have all their values spelled out without using this wild
card, and a \f(CW\*(C`NOT\*(C'\fR clause in their description that highlights their not being
binary.  These also require the compound form to match them, whereas true
binary properties have both single and compound forms available.
.PP
Note that all non-essential underscores are removed in the display of the
short names below.

Unicode has some property-value pairs that currently don't match anything.
This happens generally either because they are obsolete, or they exist for
symmetry with other forms, but no language has yet been encoded that uses
them.  In this version of Unicode, the following match zero code points:

.IX Header "Properties accessible through Unicode::UCD"
All the Unicode character properties mentioned above (except for those marked
as for internal use by Perl) are also accessible by
\&\*(L"\fIprop_invlist()\fR\*(R" in Unicode::UCD.
.PP
Due to their nature, not all Unicode character properties are suitable for
regular expression matches, nor \f(CW\*(C`prop_invlist()\*(C'\fR.  The remaining
non-provisional, non-internal ones are accessible via
\&\*(L"\fIprop_invmap()\fR\*(R" in Unicode::UCD (except for those that this Perl installation
hasn't included; see below for which those are).
.PP
For compatibility with other parts of Perl, all the single forms given in the
table in the section above
are recognized.  \s-1BUT,\s0 there are some ambiguities between some Perl extensions
and the Unicode properties, all of which are silently resolved in favor of the
official Unicode property.  To avoid surprises, you should only use
\&\f(CW\*(C`prop_invmap()\*(C'\fR for forms listed in the table below, which omits the
non-recommended ones.  The affected forms are the Perl single form equivalents
of Unicode properties, such as \f(CW\*(C`\ep{sc}\*(C'\fR being a single-form equivalent of
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{gc=sc}\*(C'\fR, which is treated by \f(CW\*(C`prop_invmap()\*(C'\fR as the \f(CW\*(C`Script\*(C'\fR property,
whose short name is \f(CW\*(C`sc\*(C'\fR.  The table indicates the current ambiguities in the
\&\s-1INFO\s0 column, beginning with the word \f(CW"NOT"\fR.
.PP
The standard Unicode properties listed below are documented in
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/>; Perl_Decimal_Digit is documented in
\&\*(L"\fIprop_invmap()\fR\*(R" in Unicode::UCD.  The other Perl extensions are in
\&\*(L"Other Properties\*(R" in perlunicode;
.PP
The first column in the table is a name for the property; the second column is
an alternative name, if any, plus possibly some annotations.  The alternative
name is the property's full name, unless that would simply repeat the first
column, in which case the second column indicates the property's short name
(if different).  The annotations are given only in the entry for the full
name.  If a property is obsolete, etc, the entry will be flagged with the same
characters used in the table in the section above, like \fBD\fR or \fBS\fR.

Perl will generate an error for a few character properties in Unicode when
used in a regular expression.  The non-Unihan ones are listed below, with the
reasons they are not accepted, perhaps with work-arounds.  The short names for
the properties are listed enclosed in (parentheses).
As described after the list, an installation can change the defaults and choose
to accept any of these.  The list is machine generated based on the
choices made for the installation that generated this document.

Deprecated by Unicode.  These are characters that expand to more than one character in the specified normalization form, but whether they actually take up more bytes or not depends on the encoding being used.

.SH "Other information in the Unicode data base"
.IX Header "Other information in the Unicode data base"
The Unicode data base is delivered in two different formats.  The \s-1XML\s0 version
is valid for more modern Unicode releases.  The other version is a collection
of files.  The two are intended to give equivalent information.  Perl uses the
older form; this allows you to recompile Perl to use early Unicode releases.
.PP
The only non-character property that Perl currently supports is Named
Sequences, in which a sequence of code points
is given a name and generally treated as a single entity.  (Perl supports
these via the \f(CW\*(C`\eN{...}\*(C'\fR double-quotish construct,
\&\*(L"charnames::string_vianame(name)\*(R" in charnames, and \*(L"\fInamedseq()\fR\*(R" in Unicode::UCD.
.PP
Below is a list of the files in the Unicode data base that Perl doesn't
currently use, along with very brief descriptions of their purposes.
Some of the names of the files have been shortened from those that Unicode
uses, in order to allow them to be distinguishable from similarly named files
on file systems for which only the first 8 characters of a name are
significant.

from version control history.  In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
\&\*(L"\s-1SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\*(R"\s0 in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.

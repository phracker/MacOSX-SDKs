By default, Archive::Tar doesn't allow extracting files outside the current
working directory.  However, this secure extraction mode could be bypassed by
putting a symlink and a regular file with the same name into the tar file.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history.  In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see

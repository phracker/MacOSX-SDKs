					when they are displayed.
					
					If a non-NULL control timebase is set, it will be used to interpret time stamps.
					You can control the timing of frame display by setting the rate and time of the
					control timebase.  
					If you are synchronizing video to audio, you can use a timebase whose master clock
					is a CMAudioDeviceClock for the appropriate audio device to prevent drift.
					
					Note that prior to OSX 10.10 and iOS 8.0, the control timebase could not be changed after enqueueSampleBuffer: was called.  As of OSX 10.10 and iOS 8.0, the control timebase may be changed at any time.

    is one of CSSM_KEYCLASS_PUBLIC_KEY, CSSM_KEYCLASS_PRIVATE_KEY
    or CSSM_KEYCLASS_SESSION_KEY.
    @constant kSecKeyPrintName type blob, human readable name of
    the key.  Same as kSecLabelItemAttr for normal keychain items.
    @constant kSecKeyAlias type blob, currently unused.
    @constant kSecKeyPermanent type uint32, value is nonzero iff
    this key is permanent (stored in some keychain).  This is always
    1.
    @constant kSecKeyPrivate type uint32, value is nonzero iff this
    key is protected by a user login or a password, or both.
    @constant kSecKeyModifiable type uint32, value is nonzero iff
    attributes of this key can be modified.
    @constant kSecKeyLabel type blob, for private and public keys
    this contains the hash of the public key.  This is used to
    associate certificates and keys.  Its value matches the value
    of the kSecPublicKeyHashItemAttr of a certificate and it's used
    to construct an identity from a certificate and a key.
    For symmetric keys this is whatever the creator of the key
    passed in during the generate key call.

    of bits in this key.
    @constant kSecKeyEffectiveKeySize type uint32, value is the
    effective number of bits in this key.  For example a des key
    has a kSecKeyKeySizeInBits of 64 but a kSecKeyEffectiveKeySize
    of 56.
    @constant kSecKeyStartDate type CSSM_DATE.  Earliest date from
    which this key may be used.  If the value is all zeros or not
    present, no restriction applies.
    @constant kSecKeyEndDate type CSSM_DATE.  Latest date at
    which this key may be used.  If the value is all zeros or not
    present, no restriction applies.
    @constant kSecKeySensitive type uint32, iff value is nonzero
    this key cannot be wrapped with CSSM_ALGID_NONE.
    @constant kSecKeyAlwaysSensitive type uint32, value is nonzero
    iff this key has always been marked sensitive.
    @constant kSecKeyExtractable type uint32, value is nonzero iff
    this key can be wrapped.
    @constant kSecKeyNeverExtractable type uint32, value is nonzero
    iff this key was never marked extractable.
    @constant kSecKeyEncrypt type uint32, value is nonzero iff this
    key can be used in an encrypt operation.
    @constant kSecKeyDecrypt type uint32, value is nonzero iff this
    key can be used in a decrypt operation.
    @constant kSecKeyDerive type uint32, value is nonzero iff this
    key can be used in a deriveKey operation.
    @constant kSecKeySign type uint32, value is nonzero iff this
    key can be used in a sign operation.

    key can unwrap other keys.

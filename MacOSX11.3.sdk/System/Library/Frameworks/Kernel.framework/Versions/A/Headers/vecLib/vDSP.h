/*  Documentation conventions:

        Many of the routines below are documented with C-like pseudocode that
        describes what they do.  For example, vDSP_vadd is declared with:

            extern void vDSP_vadd(
                const float *__A,
                vDSP_Stride  __IA,
                const float *__B,
                vDSP_Stride  __IB,
                float       *__C,
                vDSP_Stride  __IC,
                vDSP_Length  __N)
 					API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.0), ios(4.0));

        and is described with:

            for (n = 0; n < N; ++n)
                C[n] = A[n] + B[n];

        The pseudocode uses two important simplifications:

            Names are shortened.

                The prefix "__" is removed.  This prefix is used in this
                header file so that Apple parameter names do not conflict with
                other developer macro names that might be used in source files
                that include this header, as when a program might use "#define
                N 1024" to set a preprocessor macro "N" to expand to "1024".

            Vectors are simplified by omitting strides.

                The parameters A and IA (with the prefix omitted) represent a
                vector with its elements at memory locations A[i*IA], for
                appropriate values of i.  In the pseudocode, the stride IA
                is omitted; the vector is treated as a simple mathematical
                vector with elements A[i].

                This default map is assumed for all vDSP routines unless stated
                otherwise.  An array without a stride parameter has unit
                stride.  Some routines have more complicated maps.  These are
                documented with each routine.

    Default maps:

        These default maps are used unless documented otherwise for a routine.
        For real vectors:

            Pseudocode:     Memory:
            C[n]            C[n*IC]

        For complex vectors:

            Pseudocode:     Memory:
            C[n]            C->realp[n*IC] + i * C->imagp[n*IC]

        Observe that C[n] in the pseudocode is a complex number, with a real
        component and an imaginary component.


    Pseudocode:

        The pseudo-code used to describe routines is largely C with some
        additions:

            e, pi, and i are the usual mathematical constants, approximately
            2.71828182845, 3.1415926535, and sqrt(-1).

            "**" is exponentiation.  3**4 is 81.

            Re and Im are the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
            Re(3+4*i) is 3, and Im(3+4*i) is 4.

            sum(f(j), 0 <= j < N) is the sum of f(j) evaluated for each integer
            j from 0 (inclusive) to N (exclusive).  sum(j**2, 0 <= j < 4) is
            0 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 14.  Multiple dimensions may be used.  Thus,
            sum(f(j, k), 0 <= j < M, 0 <= k < N) is the sum of f(j, k)
            evaluated for each pair of integers (j, k) satisfying the
            constraints.

            conj(z) is the complex conjugate of z (the imaginary part is
            negated).

            |x| is the absolute value of x.

   Exactness, IEEE 754 conformance:

        vDSP routines are not expected to produce results identical to the
        pseudo-code in the descriptions, because vDSP routines are free to
        rearrange calculations for better performance.  These rearrangements
        are mathematical identities, so they would produce identical results
        if exact arithmetic were used.  However, floating-point arithmetic
        is approximate, and the rounding errors will often be different when
        operations are rearranged.

        Generally, vDSP routines are not expected to conform to IEEE 754.
        Notably, results may be not correctly rounded to the last bit even for
        elementary operations, and operations involving infinities and NaNs may
        be handled differently than IEEE 754 specifies.

    Const:

        vDSP does not modify the contents of input arrays (including input
        scalars passed by address).  If the specification of a routine does not
        state that it alters the memory that a parameter points to, then the
        routine does not alter that memory through that parameter.  (It may of
        course alter the same memory if it is also pointed to by an output
        parameter.  Such in-place operation is permitted for some vDSP routines
        and not for others.)

        Unfortunately, C semantics make it impractical to add "const" to
        pointers inside structs, because such structs are type-incompatible
        with structs containing pointers that are not const.  Thus, vDSP
        routines with complex parameters accept those parameters via
        DSPSplitComplex and DSPDoubleSplitComplex structs (among other types)
        and not via const versions of those structures.

    Strides:

        (Note:  This section introduces strides.  For an issue using strides
        with complex data, see "Complex strides" below.)

        Many vDSP routines use strides, which specify that the vector operated
        on is embedded in a larger array in memory.  Consider an array A of
        1024 elements.  Then:

            Passing a vDSP routine:     Says to operate on:

            Address A and stride 1      Each element A[j]

            Address A and stride 2      Every other element, A[j*2]

            Address A+1 and stride 2    Every other element, starting
                                        with A[1], so A[j*2+1]

        Strides may be used to operate on columns of multi-dimensional arrays.
        For example, consider a 32*64 element array, A[32][64].  Then passing
        address A+13 and stride 64 instructs vDSP to operate on the elements of
        column 13.

        When strides are used, generally there is some accompanying parameter
        that specifies the length of the operation.  This length is typically
        the number of elements to be processed, not the number in the larger
        array.  (Some vDSP routines have interactions between parameters so
        that the length may specify some number of output elements but requires
        a different numbe of input elements.  This is documented with each
        routine.)

    Complex strides:

        Strides with complex data (interleaved complex data, not split
        complex data) are complicated by a legacy issue.  Originally, complex
        data was regarded as an array of individual elements, so that memory
        containing values to represent complex numbers 2 + 3i, 4 + 5i, 6 + 7i,
        and so on, contained individual floating-point elements:

            A[0] A[1] A[2] A[3] A[4] A[5]…
             2    3    4    5    6    7  …

        This arrangement was said to have a stride of two, indicating that a
        new complex number starts every two elements.  In the modern view, we
        would regard this as an array of struct with a stride of one struct.
        Unfortunately, the vDSP interface is bound by requirements of backward
        compatibility and must retain the original use.

        Adding to this issue, a parameter is declared as a pointer to DSPComplex
        or DSPDoubleComplex (both structures of two floating-point elements),
        but its stride is still passed as a stride of floating-point elements.
        This means that, in C, to refer to complex element i of a vector C with
        stride IC, you must divide the stride by 2, using C[i*IC/2].
        Essentially, the floating-point element stride passed to the vDSP
        routine, IA, should be twice the complex-number struct stride.

            are not used.

        These compute:

        N = 1 << Log2N;

        If Direction is +1, a real-to-complex transform is performed, taking
        input from a real vector that has been coerced into the complex
        structure:

            scale = 2;

            // Define a real vector, h:
            for (j = 0; j < N/2; ++j)
            {
                h[2*j + 0] = C->realp[j*IC];
                h[2*j + 1] = C->imagp[j*IC];
            }

            // Perform Discrete Fourier Transform.
            for (k = 0; k < N; ++k)
                H[k] = scale *
                    sum(h[j] * e**(-Direction*2*pi*i*j*k/N), 0 <= j < N);

            // Pack DC and Nyquist components into C->realp[0] and C->imagp[0].
            C->realp[0*IC] = Re(H[ 0 ]).
            C->imagp[0*IC] = Re(H[N/2]).

            // Store regular components:
            for (k = 1; k < N/2; ++k)
            {
                C->realp[k*IC] = Re(H[k]);
                C->imagp[k*IC] = Im(H[k]);
            }

            Note that, for N/2 < k < N, H[k] is not stored.  However, since
            the input is a real vector, the output has symmetry that allows the
            unstored elements to be derived from the stored elements:  H[k] =
            conj(H(N-k)).  This symmetry also implies the DC and Nyquist
            components are real, so their imaginary parts are zero.

        If Direction is -1, a complex-to-real inverse transform is performed,
        producing a real output vector coerced into the complex structure:

            scale = 1./N;

            // Define a complex vector, h:
            h[ 0 ] = C->realp[0*IC];
            h[N/2] = C->imagp[0*IC];
            for (j = 1; j < N/2; ++j)
            {
                h[ j ] = C->realp[j*IC] + i * C->imagp[j*IC];
                h[N-j] = conj(h[j]);
            }

            // Perform Discrete Fourier Transform.
            for (k = 0; k < N; ++k)
                H[k] = scale *
                    sum(h[j] * e**(-Direction*2*pi*i*j*k/N), 0 <= j < N);

            // Coerce real results into complex structure:
            for (k = 0; k < N/2; ++k)
            {
                C->realp[k*IC] = H[2*k+0];
                C->imagp[k*IC] = H[2*k+1];
            }

            Note that, mathematically, the symmetry in the input vector compels
            every H[k] to be real, so there are no imaginary components to be
            stored.

        Setup must have been properly created by a call to vDSP_create_fftsetup
        (for single precision) or vDSP_create_fftsetupD (for double precision)
        and not subsequently destroyed.

        Direction must be +1 or -1.

        The temporary buffer versions perform the same operation but are
        permitted to use the temporary buffer for improved performance.  Each
        of Buffer->realp and Buffer->imagp must contain N/2 * sizeof *C->realp
        bytes and is preferably 16-byte aligned or better.

        N+WindowLength-1 elements.  Although only N outputs are provided in C,
        the additional elements may be used for intermediate computation.

        A and C may not overlap.

/*! @class CKOperationConfiguration
 *
 *  @discussion An operation configuration is a set of properties that describes how your operation should behave.  All properties have a default value.  When determining what properties to apply to an operation, we consult the operation's configuration property, as well as the operation->group->defaultConfiguration property.  We combine them following these rules:
 *  @code
 *   Group Default Configuration Value | Operation Configuration Value |        Value Applied To Operation
 *  -----------------------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
 *             default value           |         default value         |                  default value
 *             default value           |         explicit value        |       operation.configuration explicit value
 *             explicit value          |         default value         | operation.group.defaultConfiguration explicit value
 *             explicit value          |         explicit value        |       operation.configuration explicit value
 *  @endcode
 *  For example:
 *  CKOperationGroup -> defaultConfiguration -> allowsCellularAccess explicitly set to NO
 *  + CKOperation -> configuration -> allowsCellularAccess has default value of YES
 *  = disallow cellular access
 *
 *  CKOperationGroup -> defaultConfiguration -> allowsCellularAccess explicitly set to NO
 *  + CKOperation -> configuration -> allowsCellularAccess explicitly set to YES
 *  = allow cellular access

 *  Background         | 1 week                     | internally retried     | discretionary
 *  @endcode
 * timeoutIntervalForResource
 * - the timeout interval for any network resources retrieved by this operation
 * - this can be overridden via CKOperationConfiguration's timeoutIntervalForResource property
 *
 * Network Error Behavior
 * - when a network request in service of a CKOperation fails due to a networking error, the operation may fail with that error, or internally retry the network request.  Only a subset of networking errors are retried, and limiting factors such as timeoutIntervalForResource are still applicable.
 *
 * Discretionary Behavior
 * - network requests in service of a CKOperation may be marked as discretionary
 * - discretionary network requests are scheduled at the description of the system for optimal performance
 *
 * CKOperations have a default qualityOfService of Default.

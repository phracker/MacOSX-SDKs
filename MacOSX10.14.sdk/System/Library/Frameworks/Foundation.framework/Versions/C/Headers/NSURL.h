 - You are using a URL that you know came directly from one of the above APIs
 - You are inside the accessor block of a coordinated read or write that used NSFileCoordinatorReadingImmediatelyAvailableMetadataOnly, NSFileCoordinatorWritingForDeleting, NSFileCoordinatorWritingForMoving, or NSFileCoordinatorWritingContentIndependentMetadataOnly

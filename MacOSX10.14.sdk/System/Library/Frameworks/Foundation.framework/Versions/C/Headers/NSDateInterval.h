 NSDateInterval represents a closed date interval in the form of [startDate, endDate].  It is possible for the start and end dates to be the same with a duration of 0.  NSDateInterval does not support reverse intervals i.e. intervals where the duration is less than 0 and the end date occurs earlier in time than the start date.

/*
 (NSComparisonResult)compare:(NSDateInterval *) prioritizes ordering by start date. If the start dates are equal, then it will order by duration.
 e.g.
    Given intervals a and b
        a.   |-----|
        b.      |-----|
 [a compare:b] would return NSOrderAscending because a's startDate is earlier in time than b's start date.

 In the event that the start dates are equal, the compare method will attempt to order by duration.
 e.g.
    Given intervals c and d
        c.  |-----|
        d.  |---|
 [c compare:d] would result in NSOrderDescending because c is longer than d.

 If both the start dates and the durations are equal, then the intervals are considered equal and NSOrderedSame is returned as the result.

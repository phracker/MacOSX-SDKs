	@class AVAudioTime
	@abstract Represent a moment in time.
	@discussion
		AVAudioTime is used in AVAudioEngine to represent time. Instances are immutable.
		
		A single moment in time may be represented in two different ways:
		1. mach_absolute_time(), the system's basic clock. Commonly referred to as "host time."
		2. audio samples at a particular sample rate
		
		A single AVAudioTime instance may contain either or both representations; it might
		represent only a sample time, only a host time, or both.
		
Rationale for using host time:
[a] internally we are using AudioTimeStamp, which uses host time, and it seems silly to divide
[b] it is consistent with a standard system timing service
[c] we do provide conveniences to convert between host ticks and seconds (host time divided by
	frequency) so client code wanting to do what should be straightforward time computations can at 
	least not be cluttered by ugly multiplications and divisions by the host clock frequency.

		If anchorTime is an AVAudioTime where both host time and sample time are valid,
		and self is another timestamp where only one of the two is valid, this method
		returns a new AVAudioTime copied from self and where any additional valid fields provided by
		the anchor are also valid.
 
		Note that the anchorTime must have both host and sample time valid, and self must have
		sample rate and at least one of host or sample time valid. Otherwise this method returns nil.

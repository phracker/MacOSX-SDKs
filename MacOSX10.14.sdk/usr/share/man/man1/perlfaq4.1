This section of the \s-1FAQ\s0 answers questions related to manipulating
numbers, dates, strings, arrays, hashes, and miscellaneous data issues.
.SH "Data: Numbers"
.IX Header "Data: Numbers"
.SS "Why am I getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting (eg, 19.95)?"
.IX Subsection "Why am I getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting (eg, 19.95)?"
For the long explanation, see David Goldberg's \*(L"What Every Computer
Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic\*(R"
(<http://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse320/Documents/FloatingPoint.pdf>).
.PP
Internally, your computer represents floating-point numbers in binary.
Digital (as in powers of two) computers cannot store all numbers
exactly. Some real numbers lose precision in the process. This is a
problem with how computers store numbers and affects all computer
languages, not just Perl.
.PP
perlnumber shows the gory details of number representations and
conversions.
.PP
To limit the number of decimal places in your numbers, you can use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR function. See
\&\*(L"Floating-point Arithmetic\*(R" in perlop for more details.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    printf "%.2f", 10/3;
\&
\&    my $number = sprintf "%.2f", 10/3;
.Ve
.SS "Why is \fIint()\fP broken?"
.IX Subsection "Why is int() broken?"
Your \f(CW\*(C`int()\*(C'\fR is most probably working just fine. It's the numbers that
aren't quite what you think.
.PP
First, see the answer to \*(L"Why am I getting long decimals
(eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting
(eg, 19.95)?\*(R".
.PP
For example, this
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print int(0.6/0.2\-2), "\en";
.Ve
.PP
will in most computers print 0, not 1, because even such simple
numbers as 0.6 and 0.2 cannot be presented exactly by floating-point
numbers. What you think in the above as 'three' is really more like
2.9999999999999995559.
.SS "Why isn't my octal data interpreted correctly?"
.IX Subsection "Why isn't my octal data interpreted correctly?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
You're probably trying to convert a string to a number, which Perl only
converts as a decimal number. When Perl converts a string to a number, it
ignores leading spaces and zeroes, then assumes the rest of the digits
are in base 10:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $string = \*(Aq0644\*(Aq;
\&
\&    print $string + 0;  # prints 644
\&
\&    print $string + 44; # prints 688, certainly not octal!
.Ve
.PP
This problem usually involves one of the Perl built-ins that has the
same name a Unix command that uses octal numbers as arguments on the
command line. In this example, \f(CW\*(C`chmod\*(C'\fR on the command line knows that
its first argument is octal because that's what it does:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    %prompt> chmod 644 file
.Ve
.PP
If you want to use the same literal digits (644) in Perl, you have to tell
Perl to treat them as octal numbers either by prefixing the digits with
a \f(CW0\fR or using \f(CW\*(C`oct\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    chmod(     0644, $filename );  # right, has leading zero
\&    chmod( oct(644), $filename );  # also correct
.Ve
.PP
The problem comes in when you take your numbers from something that Perl
thinks is a string, such as a command line argument in \f(CW@ARGV\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    chmod( $ARGV[0],      $filename );  # wrong, even if "0644"
\&
\&    chmod( oct($ARGV[0]), $filename );  # correct, treat string as octal
.Ve
.PP
You can always check the value you're using by printing it in octal
notation to ensure it matches what you think it should be. Print it
in octal  and decimal format:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    printf "0%o %d", $number, $number;
.Ve
.SS "Does Perl have a \fIround()\fP function? What about \fIceil()\fP and \fIfloor()\fP? Trig functions?"
.IX Subsection "Does Perl have a round() function? What about ceil() and floor()? Trig functions?"
Remember that \f(CW\*(C`int()\*(C'\fR merely truncates toward 0. For rounding to a
certain number of digits, \f(CW\*(C`sprintf()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`printf()\*(C'\fR is usually the
easiest route.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    printf("%.3f", 3.1415926535);   # prints 3.142
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1POSIX\s0 module (part of the standard Perl distribution)
implements \f(CW\*(C`ceil()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`floor()\*(C'\fR, and a number of other mathematical
and trigonometric functions.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use POSIX;
\&    my $ceil   = ceil(3.5);   # 4
\&    my $floor  = floor(3.5);  # 3
.Ve
.PP
In 5.000 to 5.003 perls, trigonometry was done in the Math::Complex
module. With 5.004, the Math::Trig module (part of the standard Perl
distribution) implements the trigonometric functions. Internally it
uses the Math::Complex module and some functions can break out from
the real axis into the complex plane, for example the inverse sine of
2.
.PP
Rounding in financial applications can have serious implications, and
the rounding method used should be specified precisely. In these
cases, it probably pays not to trust whichever system of rounding is
being used by Perl, but instead to implement the rounding function you
need yourself.
.PP
To see why, notice how you'll still have an issue on half-way-point
alternation:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    for (my $i = 0; $i < 1.01; $i += 0.05) { printf "%.1f ",$i}
\&
\&    0.0 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7
\&    0.8 0.8 0.9 0.9 1.0 1.0
.Ve
.PP
Don't blame Perl. It's the same as in C. \s-1IEEE\s0 says we have to do
this. Perl numbers whose absolute values are integers under 2**31 (on
32\-bit machines) will work pretty much like mathematical integers.
Other numbers are not guaranteed.
.SS "How do I convert between numeric representations/bases/radixes?"
.IX Subsection "How do I convert between numeric representations/bases/radixes?"
As always with Perl there is more than one way to do it. Below are a
few examples of approaches to making common conversions between number
representations. This is intended to be representational rather than
exhaustive.
.PP
Some of the examples later in perlfaq4 use the Bit::Vector
module from \s-1CPAN.\s0 The reason you might choose Bit::Vector over the
perl built-in functions is that it works with numbers of \s-1ANY\s0 size,
that it is optimized for speed on some operations, and for at least
some programmers the notation might be familiar.

.SS "Why doesn't & work the way I want it to?"
.IX Subsection "Why doesn't & work the way I want it to?"
The behavior of binary arithmetic operators depends on whether they're
used on numbers or strings. The operators treat a string as a series
of bits and work with that (the string \f(CW"3"\fR is the bit pattern
\&\f(CW00110011\fR). The operators work with the binary form of a number
(the number \f(CW3\fR is treated as the bit pattern \f(CW00000011\fR).
.PP
So, saying \f(CW\*(C`11 & 3\*(C'\fR performs the \*(L"and\*(R" operation on numbers (yielding
\&\f(CW3\fR). Saying \f(CW"11" & "3"\fR performs the \*(L"and\*(R" operation on strings
(yielding \f(CW"1"\fR).
.PP
Most problems with \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR arise because the programmer thinks
they have a number but really it's a string or vice versa. To avoid this,
stringify the arguments explicitly (using \f(CW""\fR or \f(CW\*(C`qq()\*(C'\fR) or convert them
to numbers explicitly (using \f(CW\*(C`0+$arg\*(C'\fR). The rest arise because
the programmer says:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    if ("\e020\e020" & "\e101\e101") {
\&        # ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
but a string consisting of two null bytes (the result of \f(CW"\e020\e020"
& "\e101\e101"\fR) is not a false value in Perl. You need:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    if ( ("\e020\e020" & "\e101\e101") !~ /[^\e000]/) {
\&        # ...
\&    }
.Ve
.SS "How do I multiply matrices?"
.IX Subsection "How do I multiply matrices?"

or the \s-1PDL\s0 extension (also available from \s-1CPAN\s0).
.SS "How do I perform an operation on a series of integers?"
.IX Subsection "How do I perform an operation on a series of integers?"
To call a function on each element in an array, and collect the
results, use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @results = map { my_func($_) } @array;
.Ve
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @triple = map { 3 * $_ } @single;
.Ve
.PP
To call a function on each element of an array, but ignore the
results:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    foreach my $iterator (@array) {
\&        some_func($iterator);
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
To call a function on each integer in a (small) range, you \fBcan\fR use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @results = map { some_func($_) } (5 .. 25);
.Ve
.PP
but you should be aware that in this form, the \f(CW\*(C`..\*(C'\fR operator
creates a list of all integers in the range, which can take a lot of
memory for large ranges. However, the problem does not occur when
using \f(CW\*(C`..\*(C'\fR within a \f(CW\*(C`for\*(C'\fR loop, because in that case the range
operator is optimized to \fIiterate\fR over the range, without creating
the entire list. So
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    my @results = ();
\&    for my $i (5 .. 500_005) {
\&        push(@results, some_func($i));
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
or even
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   push(@results, some_func($_)) for 5 .. 500_005;
.Ve
.PP
will not create an intermediate list of 500,000 integers.

If you're using a version of Perl before 5.004, you must call \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR
once at the start of your program to seed the random number generator.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     BEGIN { srand() if $] < 5.004 }
.Ve
.PP
5.004 and later automatically call \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR at the beginning. Don't
call \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR more than once\*(--you make your numbers less random,
rather than more.
.PP
Computers are good at being predictable and bad at being random
(despite appearances caused by bugs in your programs :\-). The
\&\fIrandom\fR article in the \*(L"Far More Than You Ever Wanted To Know\*(R"
collection in <http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz>, courtesy
of Tom Phoenix, talks more about this. John von Neumann said, \*(L"Anyone
who attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is, of
course, living in a state of sin.\*(R"
.PP
Perl relies on the underlying system for the implementation of
\&\f(CW\*(C`rand\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR; on some systems, the generated numbers are
not random enough (especially on Windows : see
<http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=803632>).
Several \s-1CPAN\s0 modules in the \f(CW\*(C`Math\*(C'\fR namespace implement better
pseudorandom generators; see for example
Math::Random::MT (\*(L"Mersenne Twister\*(R", fast), or
Math::TrulyRandom (uses the imperfections in the system's
timer to generate random numbers, which is rather slow).
More algorithms for random numbers are described in
\&\*(L"Numerical Recipes in C\*(R" at <http://www.nr.com/>
.SS "How do I get a random number between X and Y?"
.IX Subsection "How do I get a random number between X and Y?"
To get a random number between two values, you can use the \f(CW\*(C`rand()\*(C'\fR
built-in to get a random number between 0 and 1. From there, you shift
that into the range that you want.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`rand($x)\*(C'\fR returns a number such that \f(CW\*(C`0 <= rand($x) < $x\*(C'\fR. Thus
what you want to have perl figure out is a random number in the range
from 0 to the difference between your \fIX\fR and \fIY\fR.
.PP
That is, to get a number between 10 and 15, inclusive, you want a
random number between 0 and 5 that you can then add to 10.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $number = 10 + int rand( 15\-10+1 ); # ( 10,11,12,13,14, or 15 )
.Ve
.PP
Hence you derive the following simple function to abstract
that. It selects a random integer between the two given
integers (inclusive), For example: \f(CW\*(C`random_int_between(50,120)\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    sub random_int_between {
\&        my($min, $max) = @_;
\&        # Assumes that the two arguments are integers themselves!
\&        return $min if $min == $max;
\&        ($min, $max) = ($max, $min)  if  $min > $max;
\&        return $min + int rand(1 + $max \- $min);

The day of the year is in the list returned

.PP
.Vb 1

The \s-1POSIX\s0 module can also format a date as the day of the year or
week of the year.
.PP
.Vb 3

You can also use Time::Piece, which comes with Perl and provides a

On some systems, the \s-1POSIX\s0 module's \f(CW\*(C`strftime()\*(C'\fR function has been
extended in a non-standard way to use a \f(CW%C\fR format, which they
sometimes claim is the \*(L"century\*(R". It isn't, because on most such
systems, this is only the first two digits of the four-digit year, and
thus cannot be used to determine reliably the current century or
millennium.

You could just store all your dates as a number and then subtract.
Life isn't always that simple though.
.PP
The Time::Piece module, which comes with Perl, replaces localtime
with a version that returns an object. It also overloads the comparison
operators so you can compare them directly:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use Time::Piece;
\&    my $date1 = localtime( $some_time );
\&    my $date2 = localtime( $some_other_time );
\&
\&    if( $date1 < $date2 ) {
\&        print "The date was in the past\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
You can also get differences with a subtraction, which returns a
Time::Seconds object:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $diff = $date1 \- $date2;
\&    print "The difference is ", $date_diff\->days, " days\en";
.Ve

If you want to work with formatted dates, the Date::Manip,
Date::Calc, or DateTime modules can help you.
.SS "How can I take a string and turn it into epoch seconds?"

If it's a regular enough string that it always has the same format,
you can split it up and pass the parts to \f(CW\*(C`timelocal\*(C'\fR in the standard
Time::Local module. Otherwise, you should look into the Date::Calc,
Date::Parse, and Date::Manip modules from \s-1CPAN.\s0

\&    $ perl \-MTime::Piece \-le \*(Aqprint localtime\->julian_day\*(Aq
\&    2455607.7959375

Or the modified Julian Day:

Or even the day of the year (which is what some people think of as a
Julian day):
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ perl \-MTime::Piece \-le \*(Aqprint localtime\->yday\*(Aq
\&    45
.Ve
.PP
You can also do the same things with the DateTime module:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    $ perl \-MDateTime \-le\*(Aqprint DateTime\->today\->jd\*(Aq
\&    2453401.5

You can use the Time::JulianDay module available on \s-1CPAN.\s0 Ensure
that you really want to find a Julian day, though, as many people have
different ideas about Julian days (see <http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/jdn.htm>

.IX Xref "date yesterday DateTime Date::Calc Time::Local daylight saving time day Today_and_Now localtime timelocal"
.IX Subsection "How do I find yesterday's date?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
To do it correctly, you can use one of the \f(CW\*(C`Date\*(C'\fR modules since they
work with calendars instead of times. The DateTime module makes it
simple, and give you the same time of day, only the day before,
despite daylight saving time changes:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use DateTime;
\&
\&    my $yesterday = DateTime\->now\->subtract( days => 1 );
\&
\&    print "Yesterday was $yesterday\en";
.Ve
.PP
You can also use the Date::Calc module using its \f(CW\*(C`Today_and_Now\*(C'\fR
function.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Date::Calc qw( Today_and_Now Add_Delta_DHMS );
\&
\&    my @date_time = Add_Delta_DHMS( Today_and_Now(), \-1, 0, 0, 0 );
\&
\&    print "@date_time\en";
.Ve
.PP
Most people try to use the time rather than the calendar to figure out
dates, but that assumes that days are twenty-four hours each. For
most people, there are two days a year when they aren't: the switch to
and from summer time throws this off. For example, the rest of the
suggestions will be wrong sometimes:
.PP
Starting with Perl 5.10, Time::Piece and Time::Seconds are part
of the standard distribution, so you might think that you could do
something like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Time::Piece;
\&    use Time::Seconds;
\&
\&    my $yesterday = localtime() \- ONE_DAY; # WRONG
\&    print "Yesterday was $yesterday\en";
.Ve
.PP
The Time::Piece module exports a new \f(CW\*(C`localtime\*(C'\fR that returns an
object, and Time::Seconds exports the \f(CW\*(C`ONE_DAY\*(C'\fR constant that is a
set number of seconds. This means that it always gives the time 24
hours ago, which is not always yesterday. This can cause problems
around the end of daylight saving time when there's one day that is 25
hours long.
.PP
You have the same problem with Time::Local, which will give the wrong
answer for those same special cases:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    # contributed by Gunnar Hjalmarsson

You can use the substitution operator to find pairs of characters (or
runs of characters) and replace them with a single instance. In this
substitution, we find a character in \f(CW\*(C`(.)\*(C'\fR. The memory parentheses
store the matched character in the back-reference \f(CW\*(C`\eg1\*(C'\fR and we use
that to require that the same thing immediately follow it. We replace
that part of the string with the character in \f(CW$1\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    s/(.)\eg1/$1/g;
.Ve
.PP
We can also use the transliteration operator, \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR. In this
example, the search list side of our \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR contains nothing, but
the \f(CW\*(C`c\*(C'\fR option complements that so it contains everything. The
replacement list also contains nothing, so the transliteration is
almost a no-op since it won't do any replacements (or more exactly,
replace the character with itself). However, the \f(CW\*(C`s\*(C'\fR option squashes
duplicated and consecutive characters in the string so a character
does not show up next to itself

This is documented in perlref, and although it's not the easiest
thing to read, it does work. In each of these examples, we call the
function inside the braces used to dereference a reference. If we
have more than one return value, we can construct and dereference an
anonymous array. In this case, we call the function in list context.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print "The time values are @{ [localtime] }.\en";
.Ve
.PP
If we want to call the function in scalar context, we have to do a bit
more work. We can really have any code we like inside the braces, so
we simply have to end with the scalar reference, although how you do
that is up to you, and you can use code inside the braces. Note that
the use of parens creates a list context, so we need \f(CW\*(C`scalar\*(C'\fR to
force the scalar context on the function:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print "The time is ${\e(scalar localtime)}.\en"
\&
\&    print "The time is ${ my $x = localtime; \e$x }.\en";
.Ve

If your function already returns a reference, you don't need to create
the reference yourself.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    sub timestamp { my $t = localtime; \e$t }
\&
\&    print "The time is ${ timestamp() }.\en";
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Interpolation\*(C'\fR module can also do a lot of magic for you. You can
specify a variable name, in this case \f(CW\*(C`E\*(C'\fR, to set up a tied hash that
does the interpolation for you. It has several other methods to do this
as well.

This is fine if you are just looking for a single character. However,
if you are trying to count multiple character substrings within a
larger string, \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR won't work. What you can do is wrap a \fIwhile()\fR

Text::CSV, Text::CSV_XS, and Text::ParseWords, among others.
.PP
Take the example case of trying to split a string that is
comma-separated into its different fields. You can't use \f(CW\*(C`split(/,/)\*(C'\fR
because you shouldn't split if the comma is inside quotes. For
example, take a data line like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    SAR001,"","Cimetrix, Inc","Bob Smith","CAM",N,8,1,0,7,"Error, Core Dumped"
.Ve
.PP
Due to the restriction of the quotes, this is a fairly complex
problem. Thankfully, we have Jeffrey Friedl, author of
\&\fIMastering Regular Expressions\fR, to handle these for us. He
suggests (assuming your string is contained in \f(CW$text\fR):
.PP
.Vb 7
\&     my @new = ();
\&     push(@new, $+) while $text =~ m{
\&         "([^\e"\e\e]*(?:\e\e.[^\e"\e\e]*)*)",? # groups the phrase inside the quotes
\&        | ([^,]+),?
\&        | ,
\&     }gx;
\&     push(@new, undef) if substr($text,\-1,1) eq \*(Aq,\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
If you want to represent quotation marks inside a
quotation-mark-delimited field, escape them with backslashes (eg,
\&\f(CW"like \e"this\e""\fR.
.PP
Alternatively, the Text::ParseWords module (part of the standard
Perl distribution) lets you say:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Text::ParseWords;
\&    @new = quotewords(",", 0, $text);
.Ve
.PP
For parsing or generating \s-1CSV,\s0 though, using Text::CSV rather than
implementing it yourself is highly recommended; you'll save yourself odd bugs
popping up later by just using code which has already been tried and tested in
production for years.

.IX Subsection "How do I strip blank space from the beginning/end of a string?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
A substitution can do this for you. For a single line, you want to
replace all the leading or trailing whitespace with nothing. You
can do that with a pair of substitutions:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    s/^\es+//;
\&    s/\es+$//;
.Ve
.PP
You can also write that as a single substitution, although it turns
out the combined statement is slower than the separate ones. That
might not matter to you, though:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    s/^\es+|\es+$//g;
.Ve
.PP
In this regular expression, the alternation matches either at the
beginning or the end of the string since the anchors have a lower
precedence than the alternation. With the \f(CW\*(C`/g\*(C'\fR flag, the substitution
makes all possible matches, so it gets both. Remember, the trailing
newline matches the \f(CW\*(C`\es+\*(C'\fR, and  the \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR anchor can match to the
absolute end of the string, so the newline disappears too. Just add
the newline to the output, which has the added benefit of preserving
\&\*(L"blank\*(R" (consisting entirely of whitespace) lines which the \f(CW\*(C`^\es+\*(C'\fR
would remove all by itself:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    while( <> ) {
\&        s/^\es+|\es+$//g;
\&        print "$_\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
For a multi-line string, you can apply the regular expression to each
logical line in the string by adding the \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR flag (for
\&\*(L"multi-line\*(R"). With the \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR flag, the \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR matches \fIbefore\fR an
embedded newline, so it doesn't remove it. This pattern still removes
the newline at the end of the string:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $string =~ s/^\es+|\es+$//gm;
.Ve
.PP
Remember that lines consisting entirely of whitespace will disappear,
since the first part of the alternation can match the entire string
and replace it with nothing. If you need to keep embedded blank lines,
you have to do a little more work. Instead of matching any whitespace
(since that includes a newline), just match the other whitespace:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $string =~ s/^[\et\ef ]+|[\et\ef ]+$//mg;
.Ve
.SS "How do I pad a string with blanks or pad a number with zeroes?"
.IX Subsection "How do I pad a string with blanks or pad a number with zeroes?"
In the following examples, \f(CW$pad_len\fR is the length to which you wish
to pad the string, \f(CW$text\fR or \f(CW$num\fR contains the string to be padded,
and \f(CW$pad_char\fR contains the padding character. You can use a single
character string constant instead of the \f(CW$pad_char\fR variable if you
know what it is in advance. And in the same way you can use an integer in
place of \f(CW$pad_len\fR if you know the pad length in advance.
.PP
The simplest method uses the \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR function. It can pad on the left
or right with blanks and on the left with zeroes and it will not
truncate the result. The \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR function can only pad strings on the
right with blanks and it will truncate the result to a maximum length of
\&\f(CW$pad_len\fR.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # Left padding a string with blanks (no truncation):
\&    my $padded = sprintf("%${pad_len}s", $text);
\&    my $padded = sprintf("%*s", $pad_len, $text);  # same thing
\&
\&    # Right padding a string with blanks (no truncation):
\&    my $padded = sprintf("%\-${pad_len}s", $text);
\&    my $padded = sprintf("%\-*s", $pad_len, $text); # same thing
\&
\&    # Left padding a number with 0 (no truncation):

\&
\&    # Right padding a string with blanks using pack (will truncate):
\&    my $padded = pack("A$pad_len",$text);
.Ve
.PP
If you need to pad with a character other than blank or zero you can use
one of the following methods. They all generate a pad string with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR operator and combine that with \f(CW$text\fR. These methods do
not truncate \f(CW$text\fR.
.PP
Left and right padding with any character, creating a new string:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $padded = $pad_char x ( $pad_len \- length( $text ) ) . $text;
\&    my $padded = $text . $pad_char x ( $pad_len \- length( $text ) );
.Ve
.PP
Left and right padding with any character, modifying \f(CW$text\fR directly:
.PP
.Vb 2

.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $column = substr( $line, $start_column, $length );
.Ve

You can use \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR if the columns are separated by whitespace or

\&        # ( \*(Aqfred\*(Aq, \*(Aq\*(Aq, \*(Aqbarney\*(Aq, \*(Aq\*(Aq, \*(Aqbetty\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
If you want to work with comma-separated values, don't do this since
that format is a bit more complicated. Use one of the modules that
handle that format, such as Text::CSV, Text::CSV_XS, or
Text::CSV_PP.
.PP
If you want to break apart an entire line of fixed columns, you can use
\&\f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR with the A (\s-1ASCII\s0) format. By using a number after the format
specifier, you can denote the column width. See the \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR
entries in perlfunc for more details.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @fields = unpack( $line, "A8 A8 A8 A16 A4" );
.Ve
.PP
Note that spaces in the format argument to \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR do not denote literal
spaces. If you have space separated data, you may want \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR instead.

.SS "How can I expand variables in text strings?"
.IX Subsection "How can I expand variables in text strings?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
If you can avoid it, don't, or if you can use a templating system,
such as Text::Template or Template Toolkit, do that instead. You
might even be able to get the job done with \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $string = sprintf \*(AqSay hello to %s and %s\*(Aq, $foo, $bar;
.Ve
.PP
However, for the one-off simple case where I don't want to pull out a
full templating system, I'll use a string that has two Perl scalar
variables in it. In this example, I want to expand \f(CW$foo\fR and \f(CW$bar\fR
to their variable's values:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $foo = \*(AqFred\*(Aq;
\&    my $bar = \*(AqBarney\*(Aq;
\&    $string = \*(AqSay hello to $foo and $bar\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
One way I can do this involves the substitution operator and a double
\&\f(CW\*(C`/e\*(C'\fR flag. The first \f(CW\*(C`/e\*(C'\fR evaluates \f(CW$1\fR on the replacement side and
turns it into \f(CW$foo\fR. The second /e starts with \f(CW$foo\fR and replaces
it with its value. \f(CW$foo\fR, then, turns into 'Fred', and that's finally
what's left in the string:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $string =~ s/(\e$\ew+)/$1/eeg; # \*(AqSay hello to Fred and Barney\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`/e\*(C'\fR will also silently ignore violations of strict, replacing
undefined variable names with the empty string. Since I'm using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`/e\*(C'\fR flag (twice even!), I have all of the same security problems I
have with \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR in its string form. If there's something odd in
\&\f(CW$foo\fR, perhaps something like \f(CW\*(C`@{[ system "rm \-rf /" ]}\*(C'\fR, then
I could get myself in trouble.
.PP
To get around the security problem, I could also pull the values from
a hash instead of evaluating variable names. Using a single \f(CW\*(C`/e\*(C'\fR, I
can check the hash to ensure the value exists, and if it doesn't, I
can replace the missing value with a marker, in this case \f(CW\*(C`???\*(C'\fR to
signal that I missed something:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $string = \*(AqThis has $foo and $bar\*(Aq;
\&
\&    my %Replacements = (
\&        foo  => \*(AqFred\*(Aq,
\&        );
\&
\&    # $string =~ s/\e$(\ew+)/$Replacements{$1}/g;
\&    $string =~ s/\e$(\ew+)/
\&        exists $Replacements{$1} ? $Replacements{$1} : \*(Aq???\*(Aq
\&        /eg;

\&    print $string;

The problem is that those double-quotes force
stringification\*(--coercing numbers and references into strings\*(--even
when you don't want them to be strings. Think of it this way:
double-quote expansion is used to produce new strings. If you already
have a string, why do you need more?
.PP
If you get used to writing odd things like these:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    print "$var";       # BAD
\&    my $new = "$old";       # BAD
\&    somefunc("$var");    # BAD
.Ve
.PP
You'll be in trouble. Those should (in 99.8% of the cases) be
the simpler and more direct:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    print $var;
\&    my $new = $old;
\&    somefunc($var);
.Ve
.PP
Otherwise, besides slowing you down, you're going to break code when
the thing in the scalar is actually neither a string nor a number, but
a reference:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    func(\e@array);
\&    sub func {
\&        my $aref = shift;
\&        my $oref = "$aref";  # WRONG

.Ve
.PP
You can also get into subtle problems on those few operations in Perl
that actually do care about the difference between a string and a
number, such as the magical \f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR autoincrement operator or the
\&\fIsyscall()\fR function.
.PP
Stringification also destroys arrays.

It looks to see whether each line begins with a common substring, and

whitespace found on the first line and removes that much off each
subsequent line.

.IX Subsection "What is the difference between a list and an array?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
A list is a fixed collection of scalars. An array is a variable that
holds a variable collection of scalars. An array can supply its collection
for list operations, so list operations also work on arrays:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # slices
\&    ( \*(Aqdog\*(Aq, \*(Aqcat\*(Aq, \*(Aqbird\*(Aq )[2,3];
\&    @animals[2,3];
\&
\&    # iteration
\&    foreach ( qw( dog cat bird ) ) { ... }
\&    foreach ( @animals ) { ... }
\&
\&    my @three = grep { length == 3 } qw( dog cat bird );
\&    my @three = grep { length == 3 } @animals;
\&
\&    # supply an argument list
\&    wash_animals( qw( dog cat bird ) );
\&    wash_animals( @animals );
.Ve
.PP
Array operations, which change the scalars, rearrange them, or add
or subtract some scalars, only work on arrays. These can't work on a
list, which is fixed. Array operations include \f(CW\*(C`shift\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`unshift\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`push\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pop\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`splice\*(C'\fR.
.PP
An array can also change its length:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $#animals = 1;  # truncate to two elements
\&    $#animals = 10000; # pre\-extend to 10,001 elements
.Ve
.PP
You can change an array element, but you can't change a list element:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $animals[0] = \*(AqRottweiler\*(Aq;
\&    qw( dog cat bird )[0] = \*(AqRottweiler\*(Aq; # syntax error!
\&
\&    foreach ( @animals ) {
\&        s/^d/fr/;  # works fine
\&    }
\&
\&    foreach ( qw( dog cat bird ) ) {
\&        s/^d/fr/;  # Error! Modification of read only value!
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
However, if the list element is itself a variable, it appears that you
can change a list element. However, the list element is the variable, not
the data. You're not changing the list element, but something the list
element refers to. The list element itself doesn't change: it's still
the same variable.
.PP
You also have to be careful about context. You can assign an array to
a scalar to get the number of elements in the array. This only works
for arrays, though:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $count = @animals;  # only works with arrays
.Ve
.PP
If you try to do the same thing with what you think is a list, you
get a quite different result. Although it looks like you have a list
on the righthand side, Perl actually sees a bunch of scalars separated
by a comma:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $scalar = ( \*(Aqdog\*(Aq, \*(Aqcat\*(Aq, \*(Aqbird\*(Aq );  # $scalar gets bird
.Ve
.PP
Since you're assigning to a scalar, the righthand side is in scalar
context. The comma operator (yes, it's an operator!) in scalar
context evaluates its lefthand side, throws away the result, and
evaluates it's righthand side and returns the result. In effect,
that list-lookalike assigns to \f(CW$scalar\fR it's rightmost value. Many
people mess this up because they choose a list-lookalike whose
last element is also the count they expect:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $scalar = ( 1, 2, 3 );  # $scalar gets 3, accidentally
.Ve
.ie n .SS "What is the difference between $array[1] and @array[1]?"

.IX Subsection "What is the difference between $array[1] and @array[1]?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
The difference is the sigil, that special character in front of the
array name. The \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR sigil means \*(L"exactly one item\*(R", while the \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR
sigil means \*(L"zero or more items\*(R". The \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR gets you a single scalar,
while the \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR gets you a list.
.PP
The confusion arises because people incorrectly assume that the sigil
denotes the variable type.
.PP
The \f(CW$array[1]\fR is a single-element access to the array. It's going
to return the item in index 1 (or undef if there is no item there).
If you intend to get exactly one element from the array, this is the
form you should use.
.PP
The \f(CW@array[1]\fR is an array slice, although it has only one index.
You can pull out multiple elements simultaneously by specifying
additional indices as a list, like \f(CW@array[1,4,3,0]\fR.
.PP
Using a slice on the lefthand side of the assignment supplies list
context to the righthand side. This can lead to unexpected results.
For instance, if you want to read a single line from a filehandle,
assigning to a scalar value is fine:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $array[1] = <STDIN>;
.Ve
.PP
However, in list context, the line input operator returns all of the
lines as a list. The first line goes into \f(CW@array[1]\fR and the rest
of the lines mysteriously disappear:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @array[1] = <STDIN>;  # most likely not what you want
.Ve
.PP
Either the \f(CW\*(C`use warnings\*(C'\fR pragma or the \fB\-w\fR flag will warn you when
you use an array slice with a single index.
.SS "How can I remove duplicate elements from a list or array?"
.IX Subsection "How can I remove duplicate elements from a list or array?"

.PP
Use a hash. When you think the words \*(L"unique\*(R" or \*(L"duplicated\*(R", think
\&\*(L"hash keys\*(R".
.PP
If you don't care about the order of the elements, you could just
create the hash then extract the keys. It's not important how you
create that hash: just that you use \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR to get the unique
elements.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my %hash   = map { $_, 1 } @array;
\&    # or a hash slice: @hash{ @array } = ();
\&    # or a foreach: $hash{$_} = 1 foreach ( @array );
\&
\&    my @unique = keys %hash;
.Ve
.PP
If you want to use a module, try the \f(CW\*(C`uniq\*(C'\fR function from
List::MoreUtils. In list context it returns the unique elements,
preserving their order in the list. In scalar context, it returns the
number of unique elements.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use List::MoreUtils qw(uniq);
\&
\&    my @unique = uniq( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7 ); # 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
\&    my $unique = uniq( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7 ); # 7
.Ve
.PP
You can also go through each element and skip the ones you've seen
before. Use a hash to keep track. The first time the loop sees an
element, that element has no key in \f(CW%Seen\fR. The \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR statement
creates the key and immediately uses its value, which is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, so
the loop continues to the \f(CW\*(C`push\*(C'\fR and increments the value for that
key. The next time the loop sees that same element, its key exists in
the hash \fIand\fR the value for that key is true (since it's not 0 or

Hearing the word \*(L"in\*(R" is an \fIin\fRdication that you probably should have
used a hash, not a list or array, to store your data. Hashes are
designed to answer this question quickly and efficiently. Arrays aren't.
.PP
That being said, there are several ways to approach this. In Perl 5.10
and later, you can use the smart match operator to check that an item is
contained in an array or a hash:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use 5.010;
\&
\&    if( $item ~~ @array ) {
\&        say "The array contains $item"
\&    }
\&
\&    if( $item ~~ %hash ) {
\&        say "The hash contains $item"
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
With earlier versions of Perl, you have to do a bit more work. If you
are going to make this query many times over arbitrary string values,
the fastest way is probably to invert the original array and maintain a
hash whose keys are the first array's values:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my @blues = qw/azure cerulean teal turquoise lapis\-lazuli/;
\&    my %is_blue = ();
\&    for (@blues) { $is_blue{$_} = 1 }
.Ve
.PP
Now you can check whether \f(CW$is_blue{$some_color}\fR. It might have
been a good idea to keep the blues all in a hash in the first place.
.PP
If the values are all small integers, you could use a simple indexed
array. This kind of an array will take up less space:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    my @primes = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31);
\&    my @is_tiny_prime = ();
\&    for (@primes) { $is_tiny_prime[$_] = 1 }
\&    # or simply  @istiny_prime[@primes] = (1) x @primes;
.Ve
.PP
Now you check whether \f(CW$is_tiny_prime\fR[$some_number].
.PP
If the values in question are integers instead of strings, you can save
quite a lot of space by using bit strings instead:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my @articles = ( 1..10, 150..2000, 2017 );
\&    undef $read;
\&    for (@articles) { vec($read,$_,1) = 1 }
.Ve
.PP
Now check whether \f(CW\*(C`vec($read,$n,1)\*(C'\fR is true for some \f(CW$n\fR.
.PP
These methods guarantee fast individual tests but require a re-organization
of the original list or array. They only pay off if you have to test
multiple values against the same array.
.PP
If you are testing only once, the standard module List::Util exports
the function \f(CW\*(C`first\*(C'\fR for this purpose. It works by stopping once it
finds the element. It's written in C for speed, and its Perl equivalent
looks like this subroutine:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    sub first (&@) {
\&        my $code = shift;
\&        foreach (@_) {
\&            return $_ if &{$code}();
\&        }
\&        undef;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
If speed is of little concern, the common idiom uses grep in scalar context
(which returns the number of items that passed its condition) to traverse the
entire list. This does have the benefit of telling you how many matches it
found, though.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $is_there = grep $_ eq $whatever, @array;
.Ve
.PP
If you want to actually extract the matching elements, simply use grep in
list context.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @matches = grep $_ eq $whatever, @array;
.Ve
.SS "How do I compute the difference of two arrays? How do I compute the intersection of two arrays?"
.IX Subsection "How do I compute the difference of two arrays? How do I compute the intersection of two arrays?"
Use a hash. Here's code to do both and more. It assumes that each
element is unique in a given array:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    my (@union, @intersection, @difference);
\&    my %count = ();
\&    foreach my $element (@array1, @array2) { $count{$element}++ }
\&    foreach my $element (keys %count) {
\&        push @union, $element;
\&        push @{ $count{$element} > 1 ? \e@intersection : \e@difference }, $element;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Note that this is the \fIsymmetric difference\fR, that is, all elements
in either A or in B but not in both. Think of it as an xor operation.
.SS "How do I test whether two arrays or hashes are equal?"
.IX Subsection "How do I test whether two arrays or hashes are equal?"
With Perl 5.10 and later, the smart match operator can give you the answer
with the least amount of work:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use 5.010;
\&
\&    if( @array1 ~~ @array2 ) {
\&        say "The arrays are the same";
\&    }
\&
\&    if( %hash1 ~~ %hash2 ) # doesn\*(Aqt check values!  {
\&        say "The hash keys are the same";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The following code works for single-level arrays. It uses a
stringwise comparison, and does not distinguish defined versus
undefined empty strings. Modify if you have other needs.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $are_equal = compare_arrays(\e@frogs, \e@toads);
\&
\&    sub compare_arrays {
\&        my ($first, $second) = @_;
\&        no warnings;  # silence spurious \-w undef complaints
\&        return 0 unless @$first == @$second;
\&        for (my $i = 0; $i < @$first; $i++) {
\&            return 0 if $first\->[$i] ne $second\->[$i];
\&        }
\&        return 1;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
For multilevel structures, you may wish to use an approach more
like this one. It uses the \s-1CPAN\s0 module FreezeThaw:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use FreezeThaw qw(cmpStr);
\&    my @a = my @b = ( "this", "that", [ "more", "stuff" ] );
\&
\&    printf "a and b contain %s arrays\en",
\&        cmpStr(\e@a, \e@b) == 0
\&        ? "the same"
\&        : "different";
.Ve
.PP
This approach also works for comparing hashes. Here we'll demonstrate
two different answers:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use FreezeThaw qw(cmpStr cmpStrHard);
\&
\&    my %a = my %b = ( "this" => "that", "extra" => [ "more", "stuff" ] );
\&    $a{EXTRA} = \e%b;
\&    $b{EXTRA} = \e%a;
\&
\&    printf "a and b contain %s hashes\en",
\&    cmpStr(\e%a, \e%b) == 0 ? "the same" : "different";
\&
\&    printf "a and b contain %s hashes\en",
\&    cmpStrHard(\e%a, \e%b) == 0 ? "the same" : "different";
.Ve
.PP
The first reports that both those the hashes contain the same data,
while the second reports that they do not. Which you prefer is left as
an exercise to the reader.
.SS "How do I find the first array element for which a condition is true?"
.IX Subsection "How do I find the first array element for which a condition is true?"
To find the first array element which satisfies a condition, you can
use the \f(CW\*(C`first()\*(C'\fR function in the List::Util module, which comes
with Perl 5.8. This example finds the first element that contains
\&\*(L"Perl\*(R".
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use List::Util qw(first);
\&
\&    my $element = first { /Perl/ } @array;
.Ve
.PP
If you cannot use List::Util, you can make your own loop to do the
same thing. Once you find the element, you stop the loop with last.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    my $found;
\&    foreach ( @array ) {
\&        if( /Perl/ ) { $found = $_; last }
\&    }

If you want the array index, use the \f(CW\*(C`firstidx()\*(C'\fR function from

.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use List::MoreUtils qw(firstidx);
\&    my $index = firstidx { /Perl/ } @array;
.Ve
.PP
Or write it yourself, iterating through the indices
and checking the array element at each index until you find one
that satisfies the condition:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    my( $found, $index ) = ( undef, \-1 );
\&    for( $i = 0; $i < @array; $i++ ) {
\&        if( $array[$i] =~ /Perl/ ) {

.Ve

Perl's arrays do not have a fixed size, so you don't need linked lists
if you just want to add or remove items. You can use array operations
such as \f(CW\*(C`push\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pop\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`shift\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`unshift\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`splice\*(C'\fR to do
that.
.PP
Sometimes, however, linked lists can be useful in situations where you
want to \*(L"shard\*(R" an array so you have have many small arrays instead of
a single big array. You can keep arrays longer than Perl's largest
array index, lock smaller arrays separately in threaded programs,
reallocate less memory, or quickly insert elements in the middle of
the chain.

If you want to cycle through an array endlessly, you can increment the
index modulo the number of elements in the array:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my @array = qw( a b c );
\&    my $i = 0;
\&
\&    while( 1 ) {
\&        print $array[ $i++ % @array ], "\en";
\&        last if $i > 20;
\&    }
.Ve

You can also use Tie::Cycle to use a scalar that always has the
next element of the circular array:
.PP
.Vb 1

Note that the above implementation shuffles an array in place,

You've probably seen shuffling algorithms that work using splice,
randomly picking another element to swap the current element with
.PP

This is bad because splice is already O(N), and since you do it N
times, you just invented a quadratic algorithm; that is, O(N**2).
This does not scale, although Perl is so efficient that you probably

.Ve
.PP
If you want to do the same thing to modify the values of the
hash, you can use the \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR function. As of Perl 5.6
the values are not copied, so if you modify \f(CW$orbit\fR (in this
case), you modify the value.
.PP

Prior to perl 5.6 \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR returned copies of the values,
so older perl code often contains constructions such as

For example, you don't have to store individual bits in an array

The string \f(CW$vec\fR only takes up as many bits as it needs. For

.SS "How do I process an entire hash?"
.IX Subsection "How do I process an entire hash?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
There are a couple of ways that you can process an entire hash. You
can get a list of keys, then go through each key, or grab a one
key-value pair at a time.
.PP
To go through all of the keys, use the \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR function. This extracts
all of the keys of the hash and gives them back to you as a list. You
can then get the value through the particular key you're processing:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    foreach my $key ( keys %hash ) {
\&        my $value = $hash{$key}
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Once you have the list of keys, you can process that list before you
process the hash elements. For instance, you can sort the keys so you
can process them in lexical order:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    foreach my $key ( sort keys %hash ) {
\&        my $value = $hash{$key}
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Or, you might want to only process some of the items. If you only want
to deal with the keys that start with \f(CW\*(C`text:\*(C'\fR, you can select just
those using \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    foreach my $key ( grep /^text:/, keys %hash ) {
\&        my $value = $hash{$key}
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
If the hash is very large, you might not want to create a long list of
keys. To save some memory, you can grab one key-value pair at a time using
\&\f(CW\*(C`each()\*(C'\fR, which returns a pair you haven't seen yet:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    while( my( $key, $value ) = each( %hash ) ) {
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR operator returns the pairs in apparently random order, so if
ordering matters to you, you'll have to stick with the \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR method.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`each()\*(C'\fR operator can be a bit tricky though. You can't add or
delete keys of the hash while you're using it without possibly
skipping or re-processing some pairs after Perl internally rehashes
all of the elements. Additionally, a hash has only one iterator, so if
you mix \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR on the same hash, you risk resetting
the iterator and messing up your processing. See the \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR entry in
perlfunc for more details.
.SS "How do I merge two hashes?"
.IX Xref "hash merge slice, hash"
.IX Subsection "How do I merge two hashes?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
Before you decide to merge two hashes, you have to decide what to do
if both hashes contain keys that are the same and if you want to leave
the original hashes as they were.
.PP
If you want to preserve the original hashes, copy one hash (\f(CW%hash1\fR)
to a new hash (\f(CW%new_hash\fR), then add the keys from the other hash
(\f(CW%hash2\fR to the new hash. Checking that the key already exists in
\&\f(CW%new_hash\fR gives you a chance to decide what to do with the
duplicates:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my %new_hash = %hash1; # make a copy; leave %hash1 alone
\&
\&    foreach my $key2 ( keys %hash2 ) {
\&        if( exists $new_hash{$key2} ) {
\&            warn "Key [$key2] is in both hashes!";
\&            # handle the duplicate (perhaps only warning)
\&            ...
\&            next;
\&        }
\&        else {
\&            $new_hash{$key2} = $hash2{$key2};
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
If you don't want to create a new hash, you can still use this looping
technique; just change the \f(CW%new_hash\fR to \f(CW%hash1\fR.
.PP
.Vb 11
\&    foreach my $key2 ( keys %hash2 ) {
\&        if( exists $hash1{$key2} ) {
\&            warn "Key [$key2] is in both hashes!";
\&            # handle the duplicate (perhaps only warning)
\&            ...
\&            next;
\&        }
\&        else {
\&            $hash1{$key2} = $hash2{$key2};
\&        }
\&      }
.Ve
.PP
If you don't care that one hash overwrites keys and values from the other, you
could just use a hash slice to add one hash to another. In this case, values
from \f(CW%hash2\fR replace values from \f(CW%hash1\fR when they have keys in common:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @hash1{ keys %hash2 } = values %hash2;
.Ve
.SS "What happens if I add or remove keys from a hash while iterating over it?"
.IX Subsection "What happens if I add or remove keys from a hash while iterating over it?"

.PP
The easy answer is \*(L"Don't do that!\*(R"
.PP
If you iterate through the hash with \fIeach()\fR, you can delete the key
most recently returned without worrying about it. If you delete or add
other keys, the iterator may skip or double up on them since perl
may rearrange the hash table. See the
entry for \f(CW\*(C`each()\*(C'\fR in perlfunc.

Create a reverse hash:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my %by_value = reverse %by_key;
\&    my $key = $by_value{$value};
.Ve

That's not particularly efficient. It would be more space-efficient
to use:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    while (my ($key, $value) = each %by_key) {
\&        $by_value{$value} = $key;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
If your hash could have repeated values, the methods above will only find
one of the associated keys.  This may or may not worry you. If it does
worry you, you can always reverse the hash into a hash of arrays instead:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    while (my ($key, $value) = each %by_key) {
\&         push @{$key_list_by_value{$value}}, $key;
\&    }

.SS "How can I know how many entries are in a hash?"

.PP
This is very similar to \*(L"How do I process an entire hash?\*(R", also in
perlfaq4, but a bit simpler in the common cases.
.PP
You can use the \f(CW\*(C`keys()\*(C'\fR built-in function in scalar context to find out
have many entries you have in a hash:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $key_count = keys %hash; # must be scalar context!
.Ve
.PP
If you want to find out how many entries have a defined value, that's
a bit different. You have to check each value. A \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR is handy:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $defined_value_count = grep { defined } values %hash;
.Ve
.PP
You can use that same structure to count the entries any way that
you like. If you want the count of the keys with vowels in them,
you just test for that instead:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $vowel_count = grep { /[aeiou]/ } keys %hash;
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR in scalar context returns the count. If you want the list
of matching items, just use it in list context instead:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @defined_values = grep { defined } values %hash;
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`keys()\*(C'\fR function also resets the iterator, which means that you may
see strange results if you use this between uses of other hash operators
such as \f(CW\*(C`each()\*(C'\fR.
.SS "How do I sort a hash (optionally by value instead of key)?"
.IX Subsection "How do I sort a hash (optionally by value instead of key)?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
To sort a hash, start with the keys. In this example, we give the list of
keys to the sort function which then compares them ASCIIbetically (which
might be affected by your locale settings). The output list has the keys
in ASCIIbetical order. Once we have the keys, we can go through them to
create a report which lists the keys in ASCIIbetical order.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @keys = sort { $a cmp $b } keys %hash;
\&
\&    foreach my $key ( @keys ) {
\&        printf "%\-20s %6d\en", $key, $hash{$key};
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
We could get more fancy in the \f(CW\*(C`sort()\*(C'\fR block though. Instead of
comparing the keys, we can compute a value with them and use that
value as the comparison.
.PP
For instance, to make our report order case-insensitive, we use
\&\f(CW\*(C`lc\*(C'\fR to lowercase the keys before comparing them:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @keys = sort { lc $a cmp lc $b } keys %hash;
.Ve
.PP
Note: if the computation is expensive or the hash has many elements,
you may want to look at the Schwartzian Transform to cache the
computation results.
.PP
If we want to sort by the hash value instead, we use the hash key
to look it up. We still get out a list of keys, but this time they
are ordered by their value.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @keys = sort { $hash{$a} <=> $hash{$b} } keys %hash;
.Ve
.PP
From there we can get more complex. If the hash values are the same,
we can provide a secondary sort on the hash key.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    my @keys = sort {
\&        $hash{$a} <=> $hash{$b}
\&            or
\&        "\eL$a" cmp "\eL$b"

.SS "How can I always keep my hash sorted?"

Databases\*(R" in DB_File. The Tie::IxHash module from \s-1CPAN\s0 might also be
instructive. Although this does keep your hash sorted, you might not
like the slowdown you suffer from the tie interface. Are you sure you

Hashes contain pairs of scalars: the first is the key, the
second is the value. The key will be coerced to a string,
although the value can be any kind of scalar: string,
number, or reference. If a key \f(CW$key\fR is present in
\&\f(CW%hash\fR, \f(CW\*(C`exists($hash{$key})\*(C'\fR will return true. The value
for a given key can be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, in which case
\&\f(CW$hash{$key}\fR will be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR while \f(CW\*(C`exists $hash{$key}\*(C'\fR
will return true. This corresponds to (\f(CW$key\fR, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR)
being in the hash.

Are you using a really old version of Perl?
.PP
Normally, accessing a hash key's value for a nonexistent key will
\&\fInot\fR create the key.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my %hash  = ();
\&    my $value = $hash{ \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq };
\&    print "This won\*(Aqt print\en" if exists $hash{ \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq };
.Ve
.PP
Passing \f(CW$hash{ \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq }\fR to a subroutine used to be a special case, though.
Since you could assign directly to \f(CW$_[0]\fR, Perl had to be ready to
make that assignment so it created the hash key ahead of time:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my_sub( $hash{ \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq } );
\&    print "This will print before 5.004\en" if exists $hash{ \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq };

\&        # $_[0] = \*(Aqbar\*(Aq; # create hash key in case you do this
\&        1;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Since Perl 5.004, however, this situation is a special case and Perl
creates the hash key only when you make the assignment:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my_sub( $hash{ \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq } );
\&    print "This will print, even after 5.004\en" if exists $hash{ \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq };

\&    }
.Ve
.PP
However, if you want the old behavior (and think carefully about that
because it's a weird side effect), you can pass a hash slice instead.
Perl 5.004 didn't make this a special case:

.SS "How can I use a reference as a hash key?"
.IX Subsection "How can I use a reference as a hash key?"
(contributed by brian d foy and Ben Morrow)
.PP
Hash keys are strings, so you can't really use a reference as the key.
When you try to do that, perl turns the reference into its stringified
form (for instance, \f(CW\*(C`HASH(0xDEADBEEF)\*(C'\fR). From there you can't get
back the reference from the stringified form, at least without doing
some extra work on your own.
.PP
Remember that the entry in the hash will still be there even if
the referenced variable  goes out of scope, and that it is entirely
possible for Perl to subsequently allocate a different variable at
the same address. This will mean a new variable might accidentally
be associated with the value for an old.
.PP
If you have Perl 5.10 or later, and you just want to store a value
against the reference for lookup later, you can use the core
Hash::Util::Fieldhash module. This will also handle renaming the
keys if you use multiple threads (which causes all variables to be
reallocated at new addresses, changing their stringification), and
garbage-collecting the entries when the referenced variable goes out
of scope.
.PP
If you actually need to be able to get a real reference back from
each hash entry, you can use the Tie::RefHash module, which does the
required work for you.
.SS "How can I check if a key exists in a multilevel hash?"
.IX Subsection "How can I check if a key exists in a multilevel hash?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
The trick to this problem is avoiding accidental autovivification. If
you want to check three keys deep, you might nai\*:vely try this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    my %hash;
\&    if( exists $hash{key1}{key2}{key3} ) {
\&        ...;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Even though you started with a completely empty hash, after that call to
\&\f(CW\*(C`exists\*(C'\fR you've created the structure you needed to check for \f(CW\*(C`key3\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    %hash = (
\&              \*(Aqkey1\*(Aq => {
\&                          \*(Aqkey2\*(Aq => {}
\&                        }
\&            );
.Ve
.PP
That's autovivification. You can get around this in a few ways. The
easiest way is to just turn it off. The lexical \f(CW\*(C`autovivification\*(C'\fR
pragma is available on \s-1CPAN.\s0 Now you don't add to the hash:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    {
\&        no autovivification;
\&        my %hash;
\&        if( exists $hash{key1}{key2}{key3} ) {
\&            ...;
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The Data::Diver module on \s-1CPAN\s0 can do it for you too. Its \f(CW\*(C`Dive\*(C'\fR
subroutine can tell you not only if the keys exist but also get the
value:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Data::Diver qw(Dive);
\&
\&    my @exists = Dive( \e%hash, qw(key1 key2 key3) );
\&    if(  ! @exists  ) {
\&        ...; # keys do not exist
\&    }
\&    elsif(  ! defined $exists[0]  ) {
\&        ...; # keys exist but value is undef
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
You can easily do this yourself too by checking each level of the hash
before you move onto the next level. This is essentially what
Data::Diver does for you:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    if( check_hash( \e%hash, qw(key1 key2 key3) ) ) {
\&        ...;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub check_hash {
\&       my( $hash, @keys ) = @_;
\&
\&       return unless @keys;
\&
\&       foreach my $key ( @keys ) {
\&           return unless eval { exists $hash\->{$key} };
\&           $hash = $hash\->{$key};
\&        }
\&
\&       return 1;
\&    }

.IX Subsection "How do I handle binary data correctly?"
Perl is binary-clean, so it can handle binary data just fine.
On Windows or \s-1DOS,\s0 however, you have to use \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR for binary
files to avoid conversions for line endings. In general, you should
use \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR any time you want to work with binary data.
.PP
Also see \*(L"binmode\*(R" in perlfunc or perlopentut.

If you're concerned about 8\-bit textual data then see perllocale.
If you want to deal with multibyte characters, however, there are
some gotchas. See the section on Regular Expressions.

Assuming that you don't care about \s-1IEEE\s0 notations like \*(L"NaN\*(R" or
\&\*(L"Infinity\*(R", you probably just want to use a regular expression:
.PP
.Vb 1

\&
\&    given( $number ) {
\&        when( /\eD/ )
\&            { say "\ethas nondigits"; continue }

\&            { say "\etis a whole number"; continue }
\&        when( /^\-?\ed+\ez/ )
\&            { say "\etis an integer"; continue }
\&        when( /^[+\-]?\ed+\ez/ )
\&            { say "\etis a +/\- integer"; continue }

\&            { say "\etis a C float" }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
There are also some commonly used modules for the task.
Scalar::Util (distributed with 5.8) provides access to perl's
internal function \f(CW\*(C`looks_like_number\*(C'\fR for determining whether a
variable looks like a number. Data::Types exports functions that
validate data types using both the above and other regular
expressions. Thirdly, there is Regexp::Common which has regular
expressions to match various types of numbers. Those three modules are
available from the \s-1CPAN.\s0
.PP
If you're on a \s-1POSIX\s0 system, Perl supports the \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::strtod\*(C'\fR
function for converting strings to doubles (and also \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::strtol\*(C'\fR
for longs). Its semantics are somewhat cumbersome, so here's a
\&\f(CW\*(C`getnum\*(C'\fR wrapper function for more convenient access. This function
takes a string and returns the number it found, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR for input
that isn't a C float. The \f(CW\*(C`is_numeric\*(C'\fR function is a front end to
\&\f(CW\*(C`getnum\*(C'\fR if you just want to say, \*(L"Is this a float?\*(R"
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    sub getnum {
\&        use POSIX qw(strtod);
\&        my $str = shift;

\&        $str =~ s/\es+$//;
\&        $! = 0;
\&        my($num, $unparsed) = strtod($str);
\&        if (($str eq \*(Aq\*(Aq) || ($unparsed != 0) || $!) {

For some specific applications, you can use one of the \s-1DBM\s0 modules.
See AnyDBM_File. More generically, you should consult the FreezeThaw

of the standard distribution. Here's one example using Storable's \f(CW\*(C`store\*(C'\fR

for printing out data structures. The Storable module on \s-1CPAN \s0(or the

copies its argument.

Where \f(CW$r1\fR can be a reference to any kind of data structure you'd like.
It will be deeply copied. Because \f(CW\*(C`dclone\*(C'\fR takes and returns references,
you'd have to add extra punctuation if you had a hash of arrays that
you wanted to copy.

You can use the \f(CW\*(C`UNIVERSAL\*(C'\fR class (see \s-1UNIVERSAL\s0). However, please
be very careful to consider the consequences of doing this: adding
methods to every object is very likely to have unintended
consequences. If possible, it would be better to have all your object
inherit from some common base class, or to use an object system like
Moose that supports roles.

.SH "NAME"
perlaix \- Perl version 5 on IBM AIX (UNIX) systems
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes various features of \s-1IBM\s0's \s-1UNIX\s0 operating
system \s-1AIX\s0 that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl)
is compiled and/or runs.
.SS "Compiling Perl 5 on \s-1AIX\s0"
.IX Subsection "Compiling Perl 5 on AIX"
For information on compilers on older versions of \s-1AIX,\s0 see \*(L"Compiling
Perl 5 on older \s-1AIX\s0 versions up to 4.3.3\*(R".
.PP
When compiling Perl, you must use an \s-1ANSI C\s0 compiler. \s-1AIX\s0 does not ship
an \s-1ANSI\s0 compliant C compiler with \s-1AIX\s0 by default, but binary builds of
gcc for \s-1AIX\s0 are widely available. A version of gcc is also included in
the \s-1AIX\s0 Toolbox which is shipped with \s-1AIX.\s0
.SS "Supported Compilers"
.IX Subsection "Supported Compilers"
Currently all versions of \s-1IBM\s0's \*(L"xlc\*(R", \*(L"xlc_r\*(R", \*(L"cc\*(R", \*(L"cc_r\*(R" or
\&\*(L"vac\*(R" \s-1ANSI/C\s0 compiler will work for building Perl if that compiler
works on your system.
.PP
If you plan to link Perl to any module that requires thread-support,
like DBD::Oracle, it is better to use the _r version of the compiler.
This will not build a threaded Perl, but a thread-enabled Perl. See
also \*(L"Threaded Perl\*(R" later on.
.PP
As of writing (2010\-09) only the \fI\s-1IBM XL C\s0 for \s-1AIX\s0\fR or \fI\s-1IBM XL C/\*(C+\s0
for \s-1AIX\s0\fR compiler is supported by \s-1IBM\s0 on \s-1AIX 5L/6.1/7.1.\s0
.PP
The following compiler versions are currently supported by \s-1IBM:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    IBM XL C and IBM XL C/C++ V8, V9, V10, V11
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1XL C\s0 for \s-1AIX\s0 is integrated in the \s-1XL C/\*(C+\s0 for \s-1AIX\s0 compiler and
therefore also supported.
.PP
If you choose \s-1XL C/\*(C+ V9\s0 you need \s-1APAR IZ35785\s0 installed
otherwise the integrated SDBM_File do not compile correctly due
to an optimization bug. You can circumvent this problem by
adding \-qipa to the optimization flags (\-Doptimize='\-O \-qipa').
The \s-1PTF\s0 for \s-1APAR IZ35785\s0 which solves this problem is available
from \s-1IBM \s0(April 2009 \s-1PTF\s0 for \s-1XL C/\*(C+\s0 Enterprise Edition for \s-1AIX, V9.0\s0).
.PP
If you choose \s-1XL C/\*(C+ V11\s0 you need the April 2010 \s-1PTF \s0(or newer)
installed otherwise you will not get a working Perl version.
.PP
Perl can be compiled with either \s-1IBM\s0's \s-1ANSI C\s0 compiler or with gcc.
The former is recommended, as not only it can compile Perl with no
difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later
that require the use of \s-1IBM\s0 compiler-specific command-line flags.
.PP
If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and
complete, and be sure to read the Perl \s-1INSTALL\s0 file for more gcc-specific
details. Please report any hoops you had to jump through to the
development team.
.SS "Incompatibility with \s-1AIX\s0 Toolbox lib gdbm"
.IX Subsection "Incompatibility with AIX Toolbox lib gdbm"
If the \s-1AIX\s0 Toolbox version of lib gdbm < 1.8.3\-5 is installed on your
system then Perl will not work. This library contains the header files
/opt/freeware/include/gdbm/dbm.h|ndbm.h which conflict with the \s-1AIX\s0
system versions. The lib gdbm will be automatically removed from the
wanted libraries if the presence of one of these two header files is
detected. If you want to build Perl with \s-1GDBM\s0 support then please install
at least gdbm\-devel\-1.8.3\-5 (or higher).

.PP
All tests were conducted on the oldest supported \s-1AIX\s0 technology level
with the latest support package applied. If the tested \s-1AIX\s0 version is
out of support (\s-1AIX 4.3.3, 5.1, 5.2\s0) then the last available support
level was used.
.SS "Building Dynamic Extensions on \s-1AIX\s0"
.IX Subsection "Building Dynamic Extensions on AIX"
Starting from Perl 5.7.2 (and consequently 5.8.x / 5.10.x / 5.12.x)
and \s-1AIX 4.3\s0 or newer Perl uses the \s-1AIX\s0 native dynamic loading interface
in the so called runtime linking mode instead of the emulated interface
that was used in Perl releases 5.6.1 and earlier or, for \s-1AIX\s0 releases
4.2 and earlier. This change does break backward compatibility with
compiled modules from earlier Perl releases. The change was made to make
Perl more compliant with other applications like Apache/mod_perl which are
using the \s-1AIX\s0 native interface. This change also enables the use of
\&\*(C+ code with static constructors and destructors in Perl extensions,
which was not possible using the emulated interface.
.PP
It is highly recommended to use the new interface.
.SS "Using Large Files with Perl"
.IX Subsection "Using Large Files with Perl"
Should yield no problems.
.SS "Threaded Perl"
.IX Subsection "Threaded Perl"
Should yield no problems with \s-1AIX 5.1 / 5.2 / 5.3 / 6.1 / 7.1.\s0
.PP
\&\s-1IBM\s0 uses the \s-1AIX\s0 system Perl (V5.6.0 on \s-1AIX 5.1\s0 and V5.8.2 on
\&\s-1AIX 5.2 / 5.3\s0 and 6.1; V5.8.8 on \s-1AIX 5.3 TL11\s0 and \s-1AIX 6.1 TL4\s0; V5.10.1
on \s-1AIX 7.1\s0) for some \s-1AIX\s0 system scripts. If you switch the links in
/usr/bin from the \s-1AIX\s0 system Perl (/usr/opt/perl5) to the newly build
Perl then you get the same features as with the \s-1IBM AIX\s0 system Perl if
the threaded options are used.
.PP
The threaded Perl build works also on \s-1AIX 5.1\s0 but the \s-1IBM\s0 Perl
build (Perl v5.6.0) is not threaded on \s-1AIX 5.1.\s0
.PP
Perl 5.12 an newer is not compatible with the \s-1IBM\s0 fileset perl.libext.
.SS "64\-bit Perl"
.IX Subsection "64-bit Perl"
If your \s-1AIX\s0 system is installed with 64\-bit support, you can expect 64\-bit
configurations to work. If you want to use 64\-bit Perl on \s-1AIX 6.1\s0
you need an \s-1APAR\s0 for a libc.a bug which affects (n)dbm_XXX functions.
The \s-1APAR\s0 number for this problem is \s-1IZ39077.\s0
.PP
If you need more memory (larger data segment) for your Perl programs you
can set:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    /etc/security/limits
\&    default:                    (or your user)
\&        data = \-1               (default is 262144 * 512 byte)
.Ve
.PP
With the default setting the size is limited to 128MB.
The \-1 removes this limit. If the \*(L"make test\*(R" fails please change
your /etc/security/limits as stated above.

.SS "Compiling Perl 5 on older \s-1AIX\s0 versions up to 4.3.3"
.IX Subsection "Compiling Perl 5 on older AIX versions up to 4.3.3"
Due to the fact that \s-1AIX 4.3.3\s0 reached end-of-service in December 31,
2003 this information is provided as is. The Perl versions prior to
Perl 5.8.9 could be compiled on \s-1AIX\s0 up to 4.3.3 with the following
settings (your mileage may vary):
.PP
When compiling Perl, you must use an \s-1ANSI C\s0 compiler. \s-1AIX\s0 does not ship
an \s-1ANSI\s0 compliant C\-compiler with \s-1AIX\s0 by default, but binary builds of
gcc for \s-1AIX\s0 are widely available.
.PP
At the moment of writing, \s-1AIX\s0 supports two different native C compilers,
for which you have to pay: \fBxlC\fR and \fBvac\fR. If you decide to use either
of these two (which is quite a lot easier than using gcc), be sure to
upgrade to the latest available patch level. Currently:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    xlC.C     3.1.4.10 or 3.6.6.0 or 4.0.2.2 or 5.0.2.9 or 6.0.0.3
\&    vac.C     4.4.0.3  or 5.0.2.6 or 6.0.0.1
.Ve
.PP
note that xlC has the \s-1OS\s0 version in the name as of version 4.0.2.0, so
you will find xlC.C for \s-1AIX\-5.0\s0 as package
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    xlC.aix50.rte   5.0.2.0 or 6.0.0.3
.Ve
.PP
subversions are not the same \*(L"latest\*(R" on all \s-1OS\s0 versions. For example,
the latest xlC\-5 on aix41 is 5.0.2.9, while on aix43, it is 5.0.2.7.
.PP
Perl can be compiled with either \s-1IBM\s0's \s-1ANSI C\s0 compiler or with gcc.
The former is recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no
difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later that
require the use of \s-1IBM\s0 compiler-specific command-line flags.
.PP
The \s-1IBM\s0's compiler patch levels 5.0.0.0 and 5.0.1.0 have compiler
optimization bugs that affect compiling perl.c and regcomp.c,
respectively.  If Perl's configuration detects those compiler patch
levels, optimization is turned off for the said source code files.
Upgrading to at least 5.0.2.0 is recommended.
.PP
If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and
complete, and be sure to read the Perl \s-1INSTALL\s0 file for more gcc-specific
details. Please report any hoops you had to jump through to the development
team.
.SS "\s-1OS\s0 level"
.IX Subsection "OS level"
Before installing the patches to the \s-1IBM\s0 C\-compiler you need to know the
level of patching for the Operating System. \s-1IBM\s0's command 'oslevel' will
show the base, but is not always complete (in this example oslevel shows
4.3.NULL, whereas the system might run most of 4.3.THREE):
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    # oslevel
\&    4.3.0.0
\&    # lslpp \-l | grep \*(Aqbos.rte \*(Aq
\&    bos.rte           4.3.3.75  COMMITTED  Base Operating System Runtime
\&    bos.rte            4.3.2.0  COMMITTED  Base Operating System Runtime
\&    #
.Ve
.PP
The same might happen to \s-1AIX 5.1\s0 or other \s-1OS\s0 levels. As a side note, Perl
cannot be built without bos.adt.syscalls and bos.adt.libm installed

.SS "Building Dynamic Extensions on \s-1AIX\s0 < 5L"
.IX Subsection "Building Dynamic Extensions on AIX < 5L"
\&\s-1AIX\s0 supports dynamically loadable objects as well as shared libraries.
Shared libraries by convention end with the suffix .a, which is a bit
misleading, as an archive can contain static as well as dynamic members.
For Perl dynamically loaded objects we use the .so suffix also used on
many other platforms.
.PP
Note that starting from Perl 5.7.2 (and consequently 5.8.0) and \s-1AIX 4.3\s0
or newer Perl uses the \s-1AIX\s0 native dynamic loading interface in the so
called runtime linking mode instead of the emulated interface that was
used in Perl releases 5.6.1 and earlier or, for \s-1AIX\s0 releases 4.2 and
earlier.  This change does break backward compatibility with compiled
modules from earlier Perl releases.  The change was made to make Perl
more compliant with other applications like Apache/mod_perl which are
using the \s-1AIX\s0 native interface. This change also enables the use of \*(C+
code with static constructors and destructors in Perl extensions, which
was not possible using the emulated interface.

If you've chosen to use vac 4, be sure to run 4.4.0.3. Older versions
will turn up nasty later on. For vac 5 be sure to run at least 5.0.1.0,
but vac 5.0.2.6 or up is highly recommended. Note that since \s-1IBM\s0 has
removed vac 5.0.2.1 through 5.0.2.5 from the software depot, these
versions should be considered obsolete.
.PP
Here's a brief lead of how to upgrade the compiler to the latest
level.  Of course this is subject to changes.  You can only upgrade
versions from ftp-available updates if the first three digit groups
are the same (in where you can skip intermediate unlike the patches
in the developer snapshots of Perl), or to one version up where the
\&\*(L"base\*(R" is available.  In other words, the \s-1AIX\s0 compiler patches are
cumulative.

in the \*(L"pp_ghostent\*(R" function, you may ignore it safely.  The warning
is caused by the reentrant variant of \fIgethostbyaddr()\fR having a slightly
different prototype than its non-reentrant variant, but the difference
is not really significant here.

.SS "\s-1AIX 4.2\s0 and extensions using \*(C+ with statics"
.IX Subsection "AIX 4.2 and extensions using with statics"
In \s-1AIX 4.2\s0 Perl extensions that use \*(C+ functions that use statics
may have problems in that the statics are not getting initialized.
In newer \s-1AIX\s0 releases this has been solved by linking Perl with
the libC_r library, but unfortunately in \s-1AIX 4.2\s0 the said library
has an obscure bug where the various functions related to time
(such as \fItime()\fR and \fIgettimeofday()\fR) return broken values, and
therefore in \s-1AIX 4.2\s0 Perl is not linked against the libC_r.

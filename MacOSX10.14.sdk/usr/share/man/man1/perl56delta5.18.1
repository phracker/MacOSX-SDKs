.SH "NAME"
perl56delta \- what's new for perl v5.6.0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.005 release and the 5.6.0
release.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "Interpreter cloning, threads, and concurrency"
.IX Subsection "Interpreter cloning, threads, and concurrency"
Perl 5.6.0 introduces the beginnings of support for running multiple
interpreters concurrently in different threads.  In conjunction with
the \fIperl_clone()\fR \s-1API\s0 call, which can be used to selectively duplicate
the state of any given interpreter, it is possible to compile a
piece of code once in an interpreter, clone that interpreter
one or more times, and run all the resulting interpreters in distinct
threads.
.PP
On the Windows platform, this feature is used to emulate \fIfork()\fR at the
interpreter level.  See perlfork for details about that.
.PP
This feature is still in evolution.  It is eventually meant to be used
to selectively clone a subroutine and data reachable from that
subroutine in a separate interpreter and run the cloned subroutine
in a separate thread.  Since there is no shared data between the
interpreters, little or no locking will be needed (unless parts of
the symbol table are explicitly shared).  This is obviously intended
to be an easy-to-use replacement for the existing threads support.
.PP
Support for cloning interpreters and interpreter concurrency can be
enabled using the \-Dusethreads Configure option (see win32/Makefile for
how to enable it on Windows.)  The resulting perl executable will be
functionally identical to one that was built with \-Dmultiplicity, but
the \fIperl_clone()\fR \s-1API\s0 call will only be available in the former.
.PP
\&\-Dusethreads enables the cpp macro \s-1USE_ITHREADS\s0 by default, which in turn
enables Perl source code changes that provide a clear separation between
the op tree and the data it operates with.  The former is immutable, and
can therefore be shared between an interpreter and all of its clones,
while the latter is considered local to each interpreter, and is therefore
copied for each clone.
.PP
Note that building Perl with the \-Dusemultiplicity Configure option
is adequate if you wish to run multiple \fBindependent\fR interpreters
concurrently in different threads.  \-Dusethreads only provides the
additional functionality of the \fIperl_clone()\fR \s-1API\s0 call and other
support for running \fBcloned\fR interpreters concurrently.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    NOTE: This is an experimental feature.  Implementation details are
\&    subject to change.
.Ve
.SS "Lexically scoped warning categories"
.IX Subsection "Lexically scoped warning categories"
You can now control the granularity of warnings emitted by perl at a finer
level using the \f(CW\*(C`use warnings\*(C'\fR pragma.  warnings and perllexwarn
have copious documentation on this feature.
.SS "Unicode and \s-1UTF\-8\s0 support"
.IX Subsection "Unicode and UTF-8 support"
Perl now uses \s-1UTF\-8\s0 as its internal representation for character
strings.  The \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`bytes\*(C'\fR pragmas are used to control this support
in the current lexical scope.  See perlunicode, utf8 and bytes for
more information.
.PP
This feature is expected to evolve quickly to support some form of I/O
disciplines that can be used to specify the kind of input and output data
(bytes or characters).  Until that happens, additional modules from \s-1CPAN\s0
will be needed to complete the toolkit for dealing with Unicode.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    NOTE: This should be considered an experimental feature.  Implementation
\&    details are subject to change.
.Ve
.SS "Support for interpolating named characters"
.IX Subsection "Support for interpolating named characters"
The new \f(CW\*(C`\eN\*(C'\fR escape interpolates named characters within strings.
For example, \f(CW"Hi! \eN{WHITE SMILING FACE}"\fR evaluates to a string
with a unicode smiley face at the end.
.ie n .SS """our"" declarations"
.el .SS "``our'' declarations"
.IX Subsection "our declarations"
An \*(L"our\*(R" declaration introduces a value that can be best understood
as a lexically scoped symbolic alias to a global variable in the
package that was current where the variable was declared.  This is
mostly useful as an alternative to the \f(CW\*(C`vars\*(C'\fR pragma, but also provides
the opportunity to introduce typing and other attributes for such
variables.  See \*(L"our\*(R" in perlfunc.
.SS "Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals"
.IX Subsection "Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals"
Literals of the form \f(CW\*(C`v1.2.3.4\*(C'\fR are now parsed as a string composed
of characters with the specified ordinals.  This is an alternative, more
readable way to construct (possibly unicode) strings instead of
interpolating characters, as in \f(CW"\ex{1}\ex{2}\ex{3}\ex{4}"\fR.  The leading
\&\f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR may be omitted if there are more than two ordinals, so \f(CW1.2.3\fR is
parsed the same as \f(CW\*(C`v1.2.3\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Strings written in this form are also useful to represent version \*(L"numbers\*(R".
It is easy to compare such version \*(L"numbers\*(R" (which are really just plain
strings) using any of the usual string comparison operators \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ne\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`lt\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`gt\*(C'\fR, etc., or perform bitwise string operations on them using \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR, etc.
.PP
In conjunction with the new \f(CW$^V\fR magic variable (which contains
the perl version as a string), such literals can be used as a readable way
to check if you're running a particular version of Perl:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    # this will parse in older versions of Perl also
\&    if ($^V and $^V gt v5.6.0) {
\&        # new features supported
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR also have some special magic to support such
literals, but this particular usage should be avoided because it leads to
misleading error messages under versions of Perl which don't support vector
strings.  Using a true version number will ensure correct behavior in all
versions of Perl:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    require 5.006;    # run time check for v5.6
\&    use 5.006_001;    # compile time check for v5.6.1
.Ve
.PP
Also, \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR support the Perl-specific format flag \f(CW%v\fR
to print ordinals of characters in arbitrary strings:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    printf "v%vd", $^V;         # prints current version, such as "v5.5.650"
\&    printf "%*vX", ":", $addr;  # formats IPv6 address
\&    printf "%*vb", " ", $bits;  # displays bitstring
.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"Scalar value constructors\*(R" in perldata for additional information.
.SS "Improved Perl version numbering system"
.IX Subsection "Improved Perl version numbering system"
Beginning with Perl version 5.6.0, the version number convention has been
changed to a \*(L"dotted integer\*(R" scheme that is more commonly found in open
source projects.
.PP
Maintenance versions of v5.6.0 will be released as v5.6.1, v5.6.2 etc.
The next development series following v5.6.0 will be numbered v5.7.x,
beginning with v5.7.0, and the next major production release following
v5.6.0 will be v5.8.0.
.PP
The English module now sets \f(CW$PERL_VERSION\fR to $^V (a string value) rather
than \f(CW$]\fR (a numeric value).  (This is a potential incompatibility.
Send us a report via perlbug if you are affected by this.)
.PP
The v1.2.3 syntax is also now legal in Perl.
See \*(L"Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals\*(R" for more on that.
.PP
To cope with the new versioning system's use of at least three significant
digits for each version component, the method used for incrementing the
subversion number has also changed slightly.  We assume that versions older
than v5.6.0 have been incrementing the subversion component in multiples of
10.  Versions after v5.6.0 will increment them by 1.  Thus, using the new
notation, 5.005_03 is the \*(L"same\*(R" as v5.5.30, and the first maintenance
version following v5.6.0 will be v5.6.1 (which should be read as being
equivalent to a floating point value of 5.006_001 in the older format,
stored in \f(CW$]\fR).
.SS "New syntax for declaring subroutine attributes"
.IX Subsection "New syntax for declaring subroutine attributes"
Formerly, if you wanted to mark a subroutine as being a method call or
as requiring an automatic \fIlock()\fR when it is entered, you had to declare
that with a \f(CW\*(C`use attrs\*(C'\fR pragma in the body of the subroutine.
That can now be accomplished with declaration syntax, like this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    sub mymethod : locked method;
\&    ...
\&    sub mymethod : locked method {
\&        ...
\&    }
\&
\&    sub othermethod :locked :method;
\&    ...
\&    sub othermethod :locked :method {
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
(Note how only the first \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR is mandatory, and whitespace surrounding
the \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR is optional.)
.PP
\&\fIAutoSplit.pm\fR and \fISelfLoader.pm\fR have been updated to keep the attributes
with the stubs they provide.  See attributes.
.SS "File and directory handles can be autovivified"
.IX Subsection "File and directory handles can be autovivified"
Similar to how constructs such as \f(CW\*(C`$x\->[0]\*(C'\fR autovivify a reference,
handle constructors (\fIopen()\fR, \fIopendir()\fR, \fIpipe()\fR, \fIsocketpair()\fR, \fIsysopen()\fR,
\&\fIsocket()\fR, and \fIaccept()\fR) now autovivify a file or directory handle
if the handle passed to them is an uninitialized scalar variable.  This
allows the constructs such as \f(CW\*(C`open(my $fh, ...)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`open(local $fh,...)\*(C'\fR
to be used to create filehandles that will conveniently be closed
automatically when the scope ends, provided there are no other references
to them.  This largely eliminates the need for typeglobs when opening
filehandles that must be passed around, as in the following example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    sub myopen {
\&        open my $fh, "@_"
\&             or die "Can\*(Aqt open \*(Aq@_\*(Aq: $!";
\&        return $fh;
\&    }
\&
\&    {
\&        my $f = myopen("</etc/motd");
\&        print <$f>;
\&        # $f implicitly closed here
\&    }
.Ve
.SS "\fIopen()\fP with more than two arguments"
.IX Subsection "open() with more than two arguments"
If \fIopen()\fR is passed three arguments instead of two, the second argument
is used as the mode and the third argument is taken to be the file name.
This is primarily useful for protecting against unintended magic behavior
of the traditional two-argument form.  See \*(L"open\*(R" in perlfunc.
.SS "64\-bit support"
.IX Subsection "64-bit support"

.PP
is able to use \*(L"quads\*(R" (64\-bit integers) as follows:
.IP "\(bu" 4
constants (decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary) in the code
.IP "\(bu" 4
arguments to \fIoct()\fR and \fIhex()\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
arguments to \fIprint()\fR, \fIprintf()\fR and \fIsprintf()\fR (flag prefixes ll, L, q)
.IP "\(bu" 4
printed as such
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIpack()\fR and \fIunpack()\fR \*(L"q\*(R" and \*(L"Q\*(R" formats
.IP "\(bu" 4
in basic arithmetics: + \- * / % (\s-1NOTE:\s0 operating close to the limits
of the integer values may produce surprising results)
.IP "\(bu" 4
in bit arithmetics: & | ^ ~ << >> (\s-1NOTE:\s0 these used to be forced 
to be 32 bits wide but now operate on the full native width.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIvec()\fR
.PP
Note that unless you have the case (a) you will have to configure
and compile Perl using the \-Duse64bitint Configure flag.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    NOTE: The Configure flags \-Duselonglong and \-Duse64bits have been
\&    deprecated.  Use \-Duse64bitint instead.
.Ve
.PP
There are actually two modes of 64\-bitness: the first one is achieved
using Configure \-Duse64bitint and the second one using Configure
\&\-Duse64bitall.  The difference is that the first one is minimal and
the second one maximal.  The first works in more places than the second.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`use64bitint\*(C'\fR does only as much as is required to get 64\-bit
integers into Perl (this may mean, for example, using \*(L"long longs\*(R")
while your memory may still be limited to 2 gigabytes (because your
pointers could still be 32\-bit).  Note that the name \f(CW\*(C`64bitint\*(C'\fR does
not imply that your C compiler will be using 64\-bit \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fRs (it might,
but it doesn't have to): the \f(CW\*(C`use64bitint\*(C'\fR means that you will be
able to have 64 bits wide scalar values.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`use64bitall\*(C'\fR goes all the way by attempting to switch also
integers (if it can), longs (and pointers) to being 64\-bit.  This may
create an even more binary incompatible Perl than \-Duse64bitint: the
resulting executable may not run at all in a 32\-bit box, or you may
have to reboot/reconfigure/rebuild your operating system to be 64\-bit
aware.
.PP
Natively 64\-bit systems like Alpha and Cray need neither \-Duse64bitint
nor \-Duse64bitall.
.PP
Last but not least: note that due to Perl's habit of always using
floating point numbers, the quads are still not true integers.
When quads overflow their limits (0...18_446_744_073_709_551_615 unsigned,
\&\-9_223_372_036_854_775_808...9_223_372_036_854_775_807 signed), they
are silently promoted to floating point numbers, after which they will
start losing precision (in their lower digits).
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    NOTE: 64\-bit support is still experimental on most platforms.
\&    Existing support only covers the LP64 data model.  In particular, the
\&    LLP64 data model is not yet supported.  64\-bit libraries and system
\&    APIs on many platforms have not stabilized\-\-your mileage may vary.
.Ve
.SS "Large file support"
.IX Subsection "Large file support"
If you have filesystems that support \*(L"large files\*(R" (files larger than
2 gigabytes), you may now also be able to create and access them from
Perl.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    NOTE: The default action is to enable large file support, if
\&    available on the platform.
.Ve
.PP
If the large file support is on, and you have a Fcntl constant
O_LARGEFILE, the O_LARGEFILE is automatically added to the flags
of \fIsysopen()\fR.
.PP
Beware that unless your filesystem also supports \*(L"sparse files\*(R" seeking
to umpteen petabytes may be inadvisable.
.PP
Note that in addition to requiring a proper file system to do large
files you may also need to adjust your per-process (or your
per-system, or per-process-group, or per-user-group) maximum filesize
limits before running Perl scripts that try to handle large files,
especially if you intend to write such files.
.PP
Finally, in addition to your process/process group maximum filesize
limits, you may have quota limits on your filesystems that stop you
(your user id or your user group id) from using large files.
.PP
Adjusting your process/user/group/file system/operating system limits
is outside the scope of Perl core language.  For process limits, you
may try increasing the limits using your shell's limits/limit/ulimit
command before running Perl.  The BSD::Resource extension (not
included with the standard Perl distribution) may also be of use, it
offers the getrlimit/setrlimit interface that can be used to adjust
process resource usage limits, including the maximum filesize limit.
.SS "Long doubles"
.IX Subsection "Long doubles"
In some systems you may be able to use long doubles to enhance the
range and precision of your double precision floating point numbers
(that is, Perl's numbers).  Use Configure \-Duselongdouble to enable
this support (if it is available).
.ie n .SS """more bits"""
.el .SS "``more bits''"
.IX Subsection "more bits"
You can \*(L"Configure \-Dusemorebits\*(R" to turn on both the 64\-bit support
and the long double support.
.SS "Enhanced support for \fIsort()\fP subroutines"
.IX Subsection "Enhanced support for sort() subroutines"
Perl subroutines with a prototype of \f(CW\*(C`($$)\*(C'\fR, and XSUBs in general, can
now be used as sort subroutines.  In either case, the two elements to
be compared are passed as normal parameters in \f(CW@_\fR.  See \*(L"sort\*(R" in perlfunc.
.PP
For unprototyped sort subroutines, the historical behavior of passing 
the elements to be compared as the global variables \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR remains
unchanged.
.ie n .SS """sort $coderef @foo"" allowed"
.el .SS "\f(CWsort $coderef @foo\fP allowed"
.IX Subsection "sort $coderef @foo allowed"
\&\fIsort()\fR did not accept a subroutine reference as the comparison
function in earlier versions.  This is now permitted.
.SS "File globbing implemented internally"
.IX Subsection "File globbing implemented internally"
Perl now uses the File::Glob implementation of the \fIglob()\fR operator
automatically.  This avoids using an external csh process and the
problems associated with it.
.PP

subroutines named \f(CW\*(C`CHECK\*(C'\fR are now special.  These are queued up during
compilation and behave similar to \s-1END\s0 blocks, except they are called at
the end of compilation rather than at the end of execution.  They cannot
be called directly.
.SS "\s-1POSIX\s0 character class syntax [: :] supported"

.IX Subsection "Better pseudo-random number generator"
In 5.005_0x and earlier, perl's \fIrand()\fR function used the C library
\&\fIrand\fR\|(3) function.  As of 5.005_52, Configure tests for \fIdrand48()\fR,

.SS "Weak references"
.IX Subsection "Weak references"
In previous versions of Perl, you couldn't cache objects so as
to allow them to be deleted if the last reference from outside 
the cache is deleted.  The reference in the cache would hold a
reference count on the object and the objects would never be
destroyed.
.PP
Another familiar problem is with circular references.  When an
object references itself, its reference count would never go
down to zero, and it would not get destroyed until the program
is about to exit.
.PP
Weak references solve this by allowing you to \*(L"weaken\*(R" any
reference, that is, make it not count towards the reference count.
When the last non-weak reference to an object is deleted, the object
is destroyed and all the weak references to the object are
automatically undef-ed.
.PP
To use this feature, you need the Devel::WeakRef package from \s-1CPAN,\s0 which
contains additional documentation.

Perl now allows the arrow to be omitted in many constructs
involving subroutine calls through references.  For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`$foo[10]\->(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR may now be written \f(CW\*(C`$foo[10](\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR.
This is rather similar to how the arrow may be omitted from
\&\f(CW\*(C`$foo[10]\->{\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq}\*(C'\fR.  Note however, that the arrow is still
required for \f(CW\*(C`foo(10)\->(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR.

.SS "\fIexists()\fP is supported on subroutine names"
.IX Subsection "exists() is supported on subroutine names"
The \fIexists()\fR builtin now works on subroutine names.  A subroutine
is considered to exist if it has been declared (even if implicitly).
See \*(L"exists\*(R" in perlfunc for examples.
.SS "\fIexists()\fP and \fIdelete()\fP are supported on array elements"
.IX Subsection "exists() and delete() are supported on array elements"
The \fIexists()\fR and \fIdelete()\fR builtins now work on simple arrays as well.
The behavior is similar to that on hash elements.
.PP
\&\fIexists()\fR can be used to check whether an array element has been
initialized.  This avoids autovivifying array elements that don't exist.
If the array is tied, the \s-1\fIEXISTS\s0()\fR method in the corresponding tied
package will be invoked.
.PP
\&\fIdelete()\fR may be used to remove an element from the array and return
it.  The array element at that position returns to its uninitialized
state, so that testing for the same element with \fIexists()\fR will return
false.  If the element happens to be the one at the end, the size of
the array also shrinks up to the highest element that tests true for
\&\fIexists()\fR, or 0 if none such is found.  If the array is tied, the \s-1\fIDELETE\s0()\fR 
method in the corresponding tied package will be invoked.

.SS "Pseudo-hashes work better"
.IX Subsection "Pseudo-hashes work better"
Dereferencing some types of reference values in a pseudo-hash,
such as \f(CW\*(C`$ph\->{foo}[1]\*(C'\fR, was accidentally disallowed.  This has
been corrected.
.PP
When applied to a pseudo-hash element, \fIexists()\fR now reports whether
the specified value exists, not merely if the key is valid.
.PP
\&\fIdelete()\fR now works on pseudo-hashes.  When given a pseudo-hash element
or slice it deletes the values corresponding to the keys (but not the keys
themselves).  See \*(L"Pseudo-hashes: Using an array as a hash\*(R" in perlref.
.PP
Pseudo-hash slices with constant keys are now optimized to array lookups
at compile-time.

.IX Subsection "Automatic flushing of output buffers"
\&\fIfork()\fR, \fIexec()\fR, \fIsystem()\fR, qx//, and pipe \fIopen()\fRs now flush buffers

.IX Subsection "Better diagnostics on meaningless filehandle operations"
Constructs such as \f(CW\*(C`open(<FH>)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`close(<FH>)\*(C'\fR

\&\f(CW\*(C`open(NEW, "<&OLD")\*(C'\fR now attempts to discard any data that
was previously read and buffered in \f(CW\*(C`OLD\*(C'\fR before duping the handle.
On platforms where doing this is allowed, the next read operation
on \f(CW\*(C`NEW\*(C'\fR will return the same data as the corresponding operation
on \f(CW\*(C`OLD\*(C'\fR.  Formerly, it would have returned the data from the start
of the following disk block instead.

.PP
Unrecognized alphabetic escapes encountered when parsing quote

.IX Subsection "Bit operators support full native integer width"
The bit operators (& | ^ ~ << >>) now operate on the full native
integral width (the exact size of which is available in \f(CW$Config\fR{ivsize}).
For example, if your platform is either natively 64\-bit or if Perl
has been configured to use 64\-bit integers, these operations apply
to 8 bytes (as opposed to 4 bytes on 32\-bit platforms).
For portability, be sure to mask off the excess bits in the result of

than one control character, such as \f(CW\*(C`${^XY^Z}\*(C'\fR, are illegal.
.PP
The old syntax has not changed.  As before, `^X' may be either a
literal control-X character or the two-character sequence `caret' plus
`X'.  When braces are omitted, the variable name stops after the
control character.  Thus \f(CW"$^XYZ"\fR continues to be synonymous with

.PP
As before, lexical variables may not have names beginning with control

In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what.  The

.Sp
A bug that prevented the \fIIO::Socket::protocol()\fR accessor

.Sp
IO::Socket::connect now uses non-blocking \s-1IO\s0 instead of \fIalarm()\fR
to do connect timeouts.
.Sp
IO::Socket::accept now uses \fIselect()\fR instead of \fIalarm()\fR for doing
timeouts.

.IP "Math::Complex" 4
.IX Item "Math::Complex"
The accessor methods Re, Im, arg, abs, rho, and theta can now also
act as mutators (accessor \f(CW$z\fR\->\fIRe()\fR, mutator \f(CW$z\fR\->\fIRe\fR\|(3)).
.Sp
The class method \f(CW\*(C`display_format\*(C'\fR and the corresponding object method
\&\f(CW\*(C`display_format\*(C'\fR, in addition to accepting just one argument, now can
also accept a parameter hash.  Recognized keys of a parameter hash are
\&\f(CW"style"\fR, which corresponds to the old one parameter case, and two
new parameters: \f(CW"format"\fR, which is a \fIprintf()\fR\-style format string
(defaults usually to \f(CW"%.15g"\fR, you can revert to the default by
setting the format string to \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR) used for both parts of a
complex number, and \f(CW"polar_pretty_print"\fR (defaults to true),
which controls whether an attempt is made to try to recognize small
multiples and rationals of pi (2pi, pi/2) at the argument (angle) of a
polar complex number.
.Sp
The potentially disruptive change is that in list context both methods
now \fIreturn the parameter hash\fR, instead of only the value of the
\&\f(CW"style"\fR parameter.
.IP "Math::Trig" 4
.IX Item "Math::Trig"
A little bit of radial trigonometry (cylindrical and spherical),
radial coordinate conversions, and the great circle distance were added.
.IP "Pod::Parser, Pod::InputObjects" 4
.IX Item "Pod::Parser, Pod::InputObjects"
Pod::Parser is a base class for parsing and selecting sections of
pod documentation from an input stream.  This module takes care of
identifying pod paragraphs and commands in the input and hands off the
parsed paragraphs and commands to user-defined methods which are free
to interpret or translate them as they see fit.
.Sp
Pod::InputObjects defines some input objects needed by Pod::Parser, and
for advanced users of Pod::Parser that need more about a command besides
its name and text.
.Sp
As of release 5.6.0 of Perl, Pod::Parser is now the officially sanctioned
\&\*(L"base parser code\*(R" recommended for use by all pod2xxx translators.
Pod::Text (pod2text) and Pod::Man (pod2man) have already been converted
to use Pod::Parser and efforts to convert Pod::HTML (pod2html) are already
underway.  For any questions or comments about pod parsing and translating
issues and utilities, please use the pod\-people@perl.org mailing list.
.Sp
For further information, please see Pod::Parser and Pod::InputObjects.

printed for mistakes that can be handled gracefully.  The checklist is
not complete yet.  See Pod::Checker.
.IP "Pod::ParseUtils, Pod::Find" 4

These modules provide a set of gizmos that are useful mainly for pod
translators.  Pod::Find traverses directory structures and
returns found pod files, along with their canonical names (like
\&\f(CW\*(C`File::Spec::Unix\*(C'\fR).  Pod::ParseUtils contains
\&\fBPod::List\fR (useful for storing pod list information), \fBPod::Hyperlink\fR
(for parsing the contents of \f(CW\*(C`L<>\*(C'\fR sequences) and \fBPod::Cache\fR
(for caching information about pod files, e.g., link nodes).
.IP "Pod::Select, podselect" 4
.IX Item "Pod::Select, podselect"
Pod::Select is a subclass of Pod::Parser which provides a function
named \*(L"\fIpodselect()\fR\*(R" to filter out user-specified sections of raw pod
documentation from an input stream. podselect is a script that provides
access to Pod::Select from other scripts to be used as a filter.
See Pod::Select.
.IP "Pod::Usage, pod2usage" 4
.IX Item "Pod::Usage, pod2usage"
Pod::Usage provides the function \*(L"\fIpod2usage()\fR\*(R" to print usage messages for
a Perl script based on its embedded pod documentation.  The \fIpod2usage()\fR
function is generally useful to all script authors since it lets them
write and maintain a single source (the pods) for documentation, thus
removing the need to create and maintain redundant usage message text
consisting of information already in the pods.
.Sp
There is also a pod2usage script which can be used from other kinds of
scripts to print usage messages from pods (even for non-Perl scripts
with pods embedded in comments).
.Sp
For details and examples, please see Pod::Usage.
.IP "Pod::Text and Pod::Man" 4
.IX Item "Pod::Text and Pod::Man"
Pod::Text has been rewritten to use Pod::Parser.  While \fIpod2text()\fR is
still available for backwards compatibility, the module now has a new
preferred interface.  See Pod::Text for the details.  The new Pod::Text
module is easily subclassed for tweaks to the output, and two such
subclasses (Pod::Text::Termcap for man-page-style bold and underlining
using termcap information, and Pod::Text::Color for markup with \s-1ANSI\s0 color
sequences) are now standard.
.Sp
pod2man has been turned into a module, Pod::Man, which also uses
Pod::Parser.  In the process, several outstanding bugs related to quotes
in section headers, quoting of code escapes, and nested lists have been
fixed.  pod2man is now a wrapper script around this module.
.IP "SDBM_File" 4
.IX Item "SDBM_File"
An \s-1EXISTS\s0 method has been added to this module (and \fIsdbm_exists()\fR has
been added to the underlying sdbm library), so one can now call exists
on an SDBM_File tied hash and get the correct result, rather than a
runtime error.
.Sp
A bug that may have caused data loss when more than one disk block
happens to be read from the database in a single \s-1\fIFETCH\s0()\fR has been
fixed.
.IP "Sys::Syslog" 4
.IX Item "Sys::Syslog"
Sys::Syslog now uses XSUBs to access facilities from syslog.h so it
no longer requires syslog.ph to exist.
.IP "Sys::Hostname" 4

Sys::Hostname now uses XSUBs to call the C library's \fIgethostname()\fR or
\&\fIuname()\fR if they exist.
.IP "Term::ANSIColor" 4
.IX Item "Term::ANSIColor"
Term::ANSIColor is a very simple module to provide easy and readable
access to the \s-1ANSI\s0 color and highlighting escape sequences, supported by
most \s-1ANSI\s0 terminal emulators.  It is now included standard.
.IP "Time::Local" 4
.IX Item "Time::Local"
The \fItimelocal()\fR and \fItimegm()\fR functions used to silently return bogus
results when the date fell outside the machine's integer range.  They
now consistently \fIcroak()\fR if the date falls in an unsupported range.
.IP "Win32" 4
.IX Item "Win32"
The error return value in list context has been changed for all functions
that return a list of values.  Previously these functions returned a list
with a single element \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if an error occurred.  Now these functions
return the empty list in these situations.  This applies to the following
functions:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    Win32::FsType
\&    Win32::GetOSVersion
.Ve
.Sp
The remaining functions are unchanged and continue to return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on
error even in list context.
.Sp
The Win32::SetLastError(\s-1ERROR\s0) function has been added as a complement
to the \fIWin32::GetLastError()\fR function.
.Sp
The new Win32::GetFullPathName(\s-1FILENAME\s0) returns the full absolute
pathname for \s-1FILENAME\s0 in scalar context.  In list context it returns
a two-element list containing the fully qualified directory name and
the filename.  See Win32.

.SS "Enhanced Installation Directories"
.IX Subsection "Enhanced Installation Directories"
The installation structure has been enriched to improve the support
for maintaining multiple versions of perl, to provide locations for
vendor-supplied modules, scripts, and manpages, and to ease maintenance
of locally-added modules, scripts, and manpages.  See the section on
Installation Directories in the \s-1INSTALL\s0 file for complete details.
For most users building and installing from source, the defaults should
be fine.
.PP
If you previously used \f(CW\*(C`Configure \-Dsitelib\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-Dsitearch\*(C'\fR to set
special values for library directories, you might wish to consider using
the new \f(CW\*(C`\-Dsiteprefix\*(C'\fR setting instead.  Also, if you wish to re-use a
config.sh file from an earlier version of perl, you should be sure to
check that Configure makes sensible choices for the new directories.

There are difficulties in reconciling Perl's standardization on \s-1UTF\-8\s0

When given a pathname that consists only of a drivename, such as \f(CW\*(C`A:\*(C'\fR,

For better compatibility with Unix, \f(CW\*(C`kill(0, $pid)\*(C'\fR can now be used to
test whether a process exists.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Shell\*(C'\fR module is supported.
.PP
Better support for building Perl under command.com in Windows 95

.PP
Scripts are read in binary mode by default to allow ByteLoader (and
the filter mechanism in general) to work properly.  For compatibility,
the \s-1DATA\s0 filehandle will be set to text mode if a carriage return is
detected at the end of the line containing the _\|_END_\|_ or _\|_DATA_\|_
token; if not, the \s-1DATA\s0 filehandle will be left open in binary mode.
Earlier versions always opened the \s-1DATA\s0 filehandle in text mode.
.PP
The \fIglob()\fR operator is implemented via the \f(CW\*(C`File::Glob\*(C'\fR extension,
which supports glob syntax of the C shell.  This increases the flexibility
of the \fIglob()\fR operator, but there may be compatibility issues for
programs that relied on the older globbing syntax.  If you want to
preserve compatibility with the older syntax, you might want to run
perl with \f(CW\*(C`\-MFile::DosGlob\*(C'\fR.  For details and compatibility information,

Line numbers (as reflected by \fIcaller()\fR and most diagnostics) within
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval \*(Aq...\*(Aq\*(C'\fR were often incorrect where here documents were involved.
This has been corrected.
.PP
Lexical lookups for variables appearing in \f(CW\*(C`eval \*(Aq...\*(Aq\*(C'\fR within
functions that were themselves called within an \f(CW\*(C`eval \*(Aq...\*(Aq\*(C'\fR were
searching the wrong place for lexicals.  The lexical search now
correctly ends at the subroutine's block boundary.
.PP
The use of \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR within \f(CW\*(C`eval {...}\*(C'\fR caused $@ not to be reset
correctly when no exception occurred within the eval.  This has
been fixed.

Parsing of here documents used to be flawed when they appeared as

been fixed.
.SS "All compilation errors are true errors"
.IX Subsection "All compilation errors are true errors"
Some \*(L"errors\*(R" encountered at compile time were by necessity 
generated as warnings followed by eventual termination of the
program.  This enabled more such errors to be reported in a
single run, rather than causing a hard stop at the first error
that was encountered.
.PP
The mechanism for reporting such errors has been reimplemented
to queue compile-time errors and report them at the end of the
compilation as true errors rather than as warnings.  This fixes
cases where error messages leaked through in the form of warnings
when code was compiled at run time using \f(CW\*(C`eval STRING\*(C'\fR, and
also allows such errors to be reliably trapped using \f(CW\*(C`eval "..."\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Implicitly closed filehandles are safer"
.IX Subsection "Implicitly closed filehandles are safer"
Sometimes implicitly closed filehandles (as when they are localized,
and Perl automatically closes them on exiting the scope) could
inadvertently set $? or $!.  This has been corrected.
.SS "Behavior of list slices is more consistent"
.IX Subsection "Behavior of list slices is more consistent"
When taking a slice of a literal list (as opposed to a slice of
an array or hash), Perl used to return an empty list if the
result happened to be composed of all undef values.
.PP
The new behavior is to produce an empty list if (and only if)
the original list was empty.  Consider the following example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @a = (1,undef,undef,2)[2,1,2];
.Ve
.PP
The old behavior would have resulted in \f(CW@a\fR having no elements.
The new behavior ensures it has three undefined elements.
.PP
Note in particular that the behavior of slices of the following
cases remains unchanged:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    @a = ()[1,2];
\&    @a = (getpwent)[7,0];
\&    @a = (anything_returning_empty_list())[2,1,2];

This has been fixed.
.SS "Failures in \s-1\fIDESTROY\s0()\fP"
.IX Subsection "Failures in DESTROY()"
When code in a destructor threw an exception, it went unnoticed
in earlier versions of Perl, unless someone happened to be

run.  Such failures are now visible as warnings when warnings are
enabled.
.SS "Locale bugs fixed"

\&\fIprintf()\fR and \fIsprintf()\fR previously reset the numeric locale
back to the default \*(L"C\*(R" locale.  This has been fixed.

Numbers formatted according to the local numeric locale
(such as using a decimal comma instead of a decimal dot) caused
\&\*(L"isn't numeric\*(R" warnings, even while the operations accessing
those numbers produced correct results.  These warnings have been
discontinued.
.SS "Memory leaks"
.IX Subsection "Memory leaks"
The \f(CW\*(C`eval \*(Aqreturn sub {...}\*(Aq\*(C'\fR construct could sometimes leak
memory.  This has been fixed.
.PP
Operations that aren't filehandle constructors used to leak memory
when used on invalid filehandles.  This has been fixed.

Constructs that modified \f(CW@_\fR could fail to deallocate values
in \f(CW@_\fR and thus leak memory.  This has been corrected.
.SS "Spurious subroutine stubs after failed subroutine calls"

Perl could sometimes create empty subroutine stubs when a

Prior versions used to run \s-1BEGIN \s0\fBand\fR \s-1END\s0 blocks when Perl was
run in compile-only mode.  Since this is typically not the expected
behavior, \s-1END\s0 blocks are not executed anymore when the \f(CW\*(C`\-c\*(C'\fR switch
is used, or if compilation fails.

phase ends.
.SS "Potential to leak \s-1DATA\s0 filehandles"
.IX Subsection "Potential to leak DATA filehandles"
Using the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DATA_\|_\*(C'\fR token creates an implicit filehandle to

.IX Item "Constant is not %s reference"
(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the \f(CW\*(C`use constant\*(C'\fR pragma)

(W overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified either

.IX Item "no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC"
(S) A warning peculiar to \s-1VMS. \s0 Perl was unable to find the local

.el .IP "Possible unintended interpolation of \f(CW%s\fR in string" 4
.IX Item "Possible unintended interpolation of %s in string"
(W ambiguous) It used to be that Perl would try to guess whether you
wanted an array interpolated or a literal @.  It no longer does this;
arrays are now \fIalways\fR interpolated into strings.  This means that 
if you try something like:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Sp
and the array \f(CW@example\fR doesn't exist, Perl is going to print
\&\f(CW\*(C`fred.com\*(C'\fR, which is probably not what you wanted.  To get a literal

If your platform is either natively 64\-bit or if Perl has been

there may be a potential incompatibility in the behavior of bitwise
numeric operators (& | ^ ~ << >>).  These operators used to strictly
operate on the lower 32 bits of integers in previous versions, but now
operate over the entire native integral width.  In particular, note
that unary \f(CW\*(C`~\*(C'\fR will produce different results on platforms that have
different \f(CW$Config\fR{ivsize}.  For portability, be sure to mask off
the excess bits in the result of unary \f(CW\*(C`~\*(C'\fR, e.g., \f(CW\*(C`~$x & 0xffffffff\*(C'\fR.

Enabling Perl's malloc in release 5.005 and earlier caused the namespace of
the system's malloc family of functions to be usurped by the Perl versions,
since by default they used the same names.  Besides causing problems on
platforms that do not allow these functions to be cleanly replaced, this
also meant that the system versions could not be called in programs that
used Perl's malloc.  Previous versions of Perl have allowed this behaviour
to be suppressed with the \s-1HIDEMYMALLOC\s0 and \s-1EMBEDMYMALLOC\s0 preprocessor
definitions.

As of release 5.6.0, Perl's malloc family of functions have default names

(D) Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type marker followed

However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug completely,
because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of
\&\*(L"$$0\*(R" in a string.  So Perl 5.004 still interprets \*(L"$$<digit>\*(R" in the
old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates this message as a

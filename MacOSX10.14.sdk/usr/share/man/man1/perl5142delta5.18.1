This document describes differences between the 5.14.1 release and
the 5.14.2 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.14.0, first read
perl5141delta, which describes differences between 5.14.0 and
5.14.1.

Calling \f(CW\*(C`File::Glob::bsd_glob\*(C'\fR with the unsupported flag \s-1GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC\s0 would
cause an access violation / segfault.  A Perl program that accepts a flags value from
an external source could expose itself to denial of service or arbitrary code
execution attacks.  There are no known exploits in the wild.  The problem has been
corrected by explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function
pointers to null.  Bug reported by Cle\*'ment Lecigne.

In \f(CW@INC\fR filters (subroutines returned by subroutines in \f(CW@INC\fR), \f(CW$_\fR used to
misbehave: If returned from a subroutine, it would not be copied, but the
variable itself would be returned; and freeing \f(CW$_\fR (e.g., with \f(CW\*(C`undef *_\*(C'\fR)
would cause perl to crash.  This has been fixed [perl #91880].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl 5.10.0 introduced some faulty logic that made \*(L"U*\*(R" in the middle of
a pack template equivalent to \*(L"U0\*(R" if the input string was empty.  This has
been fixed [perl #90160].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR no longer leaks memory when called from the \s-1DB\s0 package if
\&\f(CW@DB::args\fR was assigned to after the first call to \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR.  Carp
was triggering this bug [perl #97010].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::decode\*(C'\fR had a nasty bug that would modify copy-on-write scalars'
string buffers in place (i.e., skipping the copy).  This could result in
hashes having two elements with the same key [perl #91834].

Localising a tied variable used to make it read-only if it contained a
copy-on-write string.

Elements of restricted hashes (see the fields pragma) containing
copy-on-write values couldn't be deleted, nor could such hashes be cleared
(\f(CW\*(C`%hash = ()\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Locking a hash element that is a glob copy no longer causes subsequent
assignment to it to corrupt the glob.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A panic involving the combination of the regular expression modifiers
\&\f(CW\*(C`/aa\*(C'\fR introduced in 5.14.0 and the \f(CW\*(C`\eb\*(C'\fR escape sequence has been
fixed [perl #95964].

This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions
from 5.12.0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT\*(C'\fR is broken.
.Sp
Since perl 5.14.0, building with \f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT\*(C'\fR hasn't been
possible. This means that perl currently doesn't work on any platforms that
require it to be built this way, including Symbian.
.Sp
While \f(CW\*(C`PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT\*(C'\fR now works again on recent development versions of
perl, it actually working on Symbian again hasn't been verified.
.Sp
We'd be very interested in hearing from anyone working with Perl on Symbian.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on \s-1CPAN.\s0

An interface must be present and enabled for AVB use to enable the virtual audio entity on that interface. A virtual audio entity can always be removed from an interface regardless of if the interface is present or not.
.It --controller [launch | enable | disable]
Launch, enable or disable the general AVDECC Controller. Passing no arguments is the equivalent of passing enable and then passing launch.
The general AVDECC Controller is part of the AVB Audio Configuration utility that lives in the system CoreServices directory. For the functionality to be available it must be enabled. It can be hidden again by using the disable command. The launch command is provided as a convenience for not having to find the application.

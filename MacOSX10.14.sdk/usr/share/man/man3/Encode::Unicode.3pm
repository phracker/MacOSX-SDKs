.SH "Size, Endianness, and BOM"
.IX Header "Size, Endianness, and BOM"
You can categorize these \s-1CES\s0 by 3 criteria:  size of each character,
endianness, and Byte Order Mark.
.SS "by size"
.IX Subsection "by size"
\&\s-1UCS\-2\s0 is a fixed-length encoding with each character taking 16 bits.
It \fBdoes not\fR support \fIsurrogate pairs\fR.  When a surrogate pair
is encountered during \fIdecode()\fR, its place is filled with \ex{\s-1FFFD\s0}
if \fI\s-1CHECK\s0\fR is 0, or the routine croaks if \fI\s-1CHECK\s0\fR is 1.  When a
character whose ord value is larger than 0xFFFF is encountered,
its place is filled with \ex{\s-1FFFD\s0} if \fI\s-1CHECK\s0\fR is 0, or the routine
croaks if \fI\s-1CHECK\s0\fR is 1.
.PP
\&\s-1UTF\-16\s0 is almost the same as \s-1UCS\-2\s0 but it supports \fIsurrogate pairs\fR.
When it encounters a high surrogate (0xD800\-0xDBFF), it fetches the
following low surrogate (0xDC00\-0xDFFF) and \f(CW\*(C`desurrogate\*(C'\fRs them to
form a character.  Bogus surrogates result in death.  When \ex{10000}
or above is encountered during \fIencode()\fR, it \f(CW\*(C`ensurrogate\*(C'\fRs them and
pushes the surrogate pair to the output stream.
.PP
\&\s-1UTF\-32 \s0(\s-1UCS\-4\s0) is a fixed-length encoding with each character taking 32 bits.
Since it is 32\-bit, there is no need for \fIsurrogate pairs\fR.
.SS "by endianness"
.IX Subsection "by endianness"
The first (and now failed) goal of Unicode was to map all character
repertoires into a fixed-length integer so that programmers are happy.
Since each character is either a \fIshort\fR or \fIlong\fR in C, you have to
pay attention to the endianness of each platform when you pass data
to one another.
.PP
Anything marked as \s-1BE\s0 is Big Endian (or network byte order) and \s-1LE\s0 is
Little Endian (aka \s-1VAX\s0 byte order).  For anything not marked either
\&\s-1BE\s0 or \s-1LE,\s0 a character called Byte Order Mark (\s-1BOM\s0) indicating the
endianness is prepended to the string.
.PP
\&\s-1CAVEAT:\s0 Though \s-1BOM\s0 in utf8 (\exEF\exBB\exBF) is valid, it is meaningless
and as of this writing Encode suite just leave it as is (\ex{FeFF}).

This modules handles the \s-1BOM\s0 as follows.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When \s-1BE\s0 or \s-1LE\s0 is explicitly stated as the name of encoding, \s-1BOM\s0 is
simply treated as a normal character (\s-1ZERO WIDTH\s0 NO-BREAK \s-1SPACE\s0).
.IP "\(bu" 4
When \s-1BE\s0 or \s-1LE\s0 is omitted during \fIdecode()\fR, it checks if \s-1BOM\s0 is at the
beginning of the string; if one is found, the endianness is set to
what the \s-1BOM\s0 says.  If no \s-1BOM\s0 is found, the routine dies.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When \s-1BE\s0 or \s-1LE\s0 is omitted during \fIencode()\fR, it returns a BE-encoded
string with \s-1BOM\s0 prepended.  So when you want to encode a whole text
file, make sure you \fIencode()\fR the whole text at once, not line by line
or each line, not file, will have a \s-1BOM\s0 prepended.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`UCS\-2\*(C'\fR is an exception.  Unlike others, this is an alias of \s-1UCS\-2BE.
UCS\-2\s0 is already registered by \s-1IANA\s0 and others that way.
.SH "Surrogate Pairs"
.IX Header "Surrogate Pairs"
To say the least, surrogate pairs were the biggest mistake of the
Unicode Consortium.  But according to the late Douglas Adams in \fIThe
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\fR Trilogy, \f(CW\*(C`In the beginning the
Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and
been widely regarded as a bad move\*(C'\fR.  Their mistake was not of this
magnitude so let's forgive them.
.PP
(I don't dare make any comparison with Unicode Consortium and the
Vogons here ;)  Or, comparing Encode to Babel Fish is completely
appropriate \*(-- if you can only stick this into your ear :)
.PP
Surrogate pairs were born when the Unicode Consortium finally
admitted that 16 bits were not big enough to hold all the world's
character repertoires.  But they already made \s-1UCS\-2\s0 16\-bit.  What
do we do?
.PP
Back then, the range 0xD800\-0xDFFF was not allocated.  Let's split
that range in half and use the first half to represent the \f(CW\*(C`upper
half of a character\*(C'\fR and the second half to represent the \f(CW\*(C`lower
half of a character\*(C'\fR.  That way, you can represent 1024 * 1024 =
1048576 more characters.  Now we can store character ranges up to
\&\ex{10ffff} even with 16\-bit encodings.  This pair of half-character is
now called a \fIsurrogate pair\fR and \s-1UTF\-16\s0 is the name of the encoding
that embraces them.
.PP
Here is a formula to ensurrogate a Unicode character \ex{10000} and
above;
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $hi = ($uni \- 0x10000) / 0x400 + 0xD800;
\&  $lo = ($uni \- 0x10000) % 0x400 + 0xDC00;
.Ve
.PP
And to desurrogate;
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $uni = 0x10000 + ($hi \- 0xD800) * 0x400 + ($lo \- 0xDC00);
.Ve
.PP
Note this move has made \ex{D800}\-\ex{\s-1DFFF\s0} into a forbidden zone but
perl does not prohibit the use of characters within this range.  To perl,
every one of \ex{0000_0000} up to \ex{ffff_ffff} (*) is \fIa character\fR.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  (*) or \ex{ffff_ffff_ffff_ffff} if your perl is compiled with 64\-bit

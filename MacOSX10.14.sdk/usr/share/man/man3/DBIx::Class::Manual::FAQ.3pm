DBIx::Class::Manual::FAQ \- Frequently Asked Questions (in theory)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document is intended as an anti-map of the documentation. If you
know what you want to do, but not how to do it in DBIx::Class, then
look here. It does \fBnot\fR contain much code or examples, it just gives
explanations and pointers to the correct pieces of documentation to
read.
.SH "FAQs"
.IX Header "FAQs"
How Do I:
.SS "Getting started"
.IX Subsection "Getting started"
.IP ".. create a database to use?" 4
.IX Item ".. create a database to use?"
First, choose a database. For testing/experimenting, we recommend
DBD::SQLite, which is a self-contained small database (i.e. all you
need to do is to install DBD::SQLite from \s-1CPAN,\s0 and it works).
.Sp
Next, spend some time defining which data you need to store, and how
it relates to the other data you have. For some help on normalisation,
go to <http://b62.tripod.com/doc/dbbase.htm>.
.Sp
Now, decide whether you want to have the database itself be the
definitive source of information about the data layout, or your
DBIx::Class schema. If it's the former, look up the documentation for
your database, eg. <http://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html>, on how
to create tables, and start creating them. For a nice universal
interface to your database, you can try DBI::Shell. If you decided
on the latter choice, read the \s-1FAQ\s0 on setting up your classes
manually, and the one on creating tables from your schema.
.IP ".. use DBIx::Class with Catalyst?" 4
.IX Item ".. use DBIx::Class with Catalyst?"
Install Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema from \s-1CPAN.\s0 See its
documentation, or below, for further details.
.IP ".. set up my DBIx::Class classes automatically from my database?" 4
.IX Item ".. set up my DBIx::Class classes automatically from my database?"
Install DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader from \s-1CPAN,\s0 and read its documentation.
.IP ".. set up my DBIx::Class classes manually?" 4
.IX Item ".. set up my DBIx::Class classes manually?"
Look at the DBIx::Class::Manual::Example and come back here if you get lost.
.IP ".. create my database tables from my DBIx::Class schema?" 4
.IX Item ".. create my database tables from my DBIx::Class schema?"
Create your classes manually, as above. Write a script that calls
\&\*(L"deploy\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Schema. See there for details, or the
DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook.
.IP ".. store/retrieve Unicode data in my database?" 4
.IX Item ".. store/retrieve Unicode data in my database?"
Make sure you database supports Unicode and set the connect
attributes appropriately \- see
\&\*(L"Using Unicode\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook
.IP ".. connect to my database?" 4
.IX Item ".. connect to my database?"
Once you have created all the appropriate table/source classes, and an
overall Schema class, you can start using
them in an application. To do this, you need to create a central
Schema object, which is used to access all the data in the various
tables. See \*(L"connect\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Schema for details. The actual
connection does not happen until you actually request data, so don't
be alarmed if the error from incorrect connection details happens a
lot later.
.IP ".. use DBIx::Class across multiple databases?" 4
.IX Item ".. use DBIx::Class across multiple databases?"
If your database server allows you to run queries across multiple
databases at once, then so can DBIx::Class. All you need to do is make
sure you write the database name as part of the
\&\*(L"table\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSource call. Eg:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->table(\*(Aqmydb.mytablename\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
And load all the Result classes for both / all databases using one
\&\*(L"load_namespaces\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Schema call.
.IP ".. use DBIx::Class across PostgreSQL/DB2/Oracle schemas?" 4
.IX Item ".. use DBIx::Class across PostgreSQL/DB2/Oracle schemas?"
Add the name of the schema to the \*(L"table\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSource
as part of the name, and make sure you give the one user you are going
to connect with has permissions to read/write all the schemas/tables as
necessary.
.SS "Relationships"
.IX Subsection "Relationships"
.IP ".. tell DBIx::Class about relationships between my tables?" 4
.IX Item ".. tell DBIx::Class about relationships between my tables?"
There are a variety of relationship types that come pre-defined for
you to use.  These are all listed in DBIx::Class::Relationship. If
you need a non-standard type, or more information, look in
DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base.
.IP ".. define a one-to-many relationship?" 4
.IX Item ".. define a one-to-many relationship?"
This is called a \f(CW\*(C`has_many\*(C'\fR relationship on the one side, and a
\&\f(CW\*(C`belongs_to\*(C'\fR relationship on the many side. Currently these need to
be set up individually on each side. See DBIx::Class::Relationship
for details.
.IP ".. define a relationship where this table contains another table's primary key? (foreign key)" 4
.IX Item ".. define a relationship where this table contains another table's primary key? (foreign key)"
Create a \f(CW\*(C`belongs_to\*(C'\fR relationship for the field containing the
foreign key.  See \*(L"belongs_to\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Relationship.
.IP ".. define a foreign key relationship where the key field may contain \s-1NULL\s0?" 4
.IX Item ".. define a foreign key relationship where the key field may contain NULL?"
Just create a \f(CW\*(C`belongs_to\*(C'\fR relationship, as above. If the column is
\&\s-1NULL\s0 then the inflation to the foreign object will not happen. This
has a side effect of not always fetching all the relevant data, if you
use a nullable foreign-key relationship in a \s-1JOIN,\s0 then you probably
want to set the \f(CW\*(C`join_type\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`left\*(C'\fR.
.IP ".. define a relationship where the key consists of more than one column?" 4
.IX Item ".. define a relationship where the key consists of more than one column?"
Instead of supplying a single column name, all relationship types also
allow you to supply a hashref containing the condition across which
the tables are to be joined. The condition may contain as many fields
as you like. See DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base.
.IP ".. define a relationship bridge across an intermediate table? (many-to-many)" 4
.IX Item ".. define a relationship bridge across an intermediate table? (many-to-many)"
The term 'relationship' is used loosely with many_to_many as it is not considered a
relationship in the fullest sense.  For more info, read the documentation on \*(L"many_to_many\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Relationship.
.IP ".. stop DBIx::Class from attempting to cascade deletes on my has_many and might_have relationships?" 4
.IX Item ".. stop DBIx::Class from attempting to cascade deletes on my has_many and might_have relationships?"
By default, DBIx::Class cascades deletes and updates across
\&\f(CW\*(C`has_many\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`might_have\*(C'\fR relationships. You can disable this
behaviour on a per-relationship basis by supplying
\&\f(CW\*(C`cascade_delete => 0\*(C'\fR in the relationship attributes.
.Sp
The cascaded operations are performed after the requested delete or
update, so if your database has a constraint on the relationship, it
will have deleted/updated the related records or raised an exception
before DBIx::Class gets to perform the cascaded operation.
.Sp
See DBIx::Class::Relationship.
.IP ".. use a relationship?" 4
.IX Item ".. use a relationship?"
Use its name. An accessor is created using the name. See examples in
\&\*(L"Using relationships\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook.
.SS "Searching"
.IX Subsection "Searching"
.IP ".. search for data?" 4
.IX Item ".. search for data?"
Create a \f(CW$schema\fR object, as mentioned above in \*(L".. connect to my
database?\*(R". Find the
ResultSet that you want to
search in, by calling \f(CW\*(C`$schema\->resultset(\*(AqMySource\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR and call
\&\f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR on it. See \*(L"search\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet.
.IP ".. search using database functions?" 4
.IX Item ".. search using database functions?"
Supplying something like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& \->search({\*(Aqmydatefield\*(Aq => \*(Aqnow()\*(Aq})
.Ve
.Sp
to search, will probably not do what you expect. It will quote the
text \*(L"\fInow()\fR\*(R", instead of trying to call the function. To provide
literal, unquoted text you need to pass in a scalar reference, like
so:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& \->search({\*(Aqmydatefield\*(Aq => \e\*(Aqnow()\*(Aq})
.Ve
.IP ".. sort the results of my search?" 4
.IX Item ".. sort the results of my search?"
Supply a list of columns you want to sort by to the \f(CW\*(C`order_by\*(C'\fR
attribute. See \*(L"order_by\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet.
.ie n .IP ".. sort my results based on fields I've aliased using ""as""?" 4
.el .IP ".. sort my results based on fields I've aliased using \f(CWas\fR?" 4
.IX Item ".. sort my results based on fields I've aliased using as?"
You didn't alias anything, since as
\&\fBhas nothing to do\fR with the produced \s-1SQL.\s0 See
\&\*(L"select\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet for details.
.IP ".. group the results of my search?" 4
.IX Item ".. group the results of my search?"
Supply a list of columns you want to group on, to the \f(CW\*(C`group_by\*(C'\fR
attribute, see \*(L"group_by\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet.
.ie n .IP ".. group my results based on fields I've aliased using ""as""?" 4
.el .IP ".. group my results based on fields I've aliased using \f(CWas\fR?" 4
.IX Item ".. group my results based on fields I've aliased using as?"
You don't. See the explanation on ordering by an alias above.
.IP ".. filter the results of my search?" 4
.IX Item ".. filter the results of my search?"
The first argument to \f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR is a hashref of accessor names and
values to filter them by, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& \->search({\*(Aqcreated_time\*(Aq => { \*(Aq>=\*(Aq, \*(Aq2006\-06\-01 00:00:00\*(Aq } })
.Ve
.Sp
Note that to use a function here you need to make it a scalar
reference:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& \->search({\*(Aqcreated_time\*(Aq => { \*(Aq>=\*(Aq, \e\*(Aqyesterday()\*(Aq } })
.Ve
.IP ".. search in several tables simultaneously?" 4
.IX Item ".. search in several tables simultaneously?"
To search in two related tables, you first need to set up appropriate
relationships between their respective classes. When searching you
then supply the name of the relationship to the \f(CW\*(C`join\*(C'\fR attribute in
your search, for example when searching in the Books table for all the
books by the author \*(L"Fred Bloggs\*(R":
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& \->search({\*(Aqauthors.name\*(Aq => \*(AqFred Bloggs\*(Aq}, { join => \*(Aqauthors\*(Aq })
.Ve
.Sp
The type of join created in your \s-1SQL\s0 depends on the type of
relationship between the two tables, see DBIx::Class::Relationship
for the join used by each relationship.
.IP ".. create joins with conditions other than column equality?" 4
.IX Item ".. create joins with conditions other than column equality?"
Currently, DBIx::Class can only create join conditions using
equality, so you're probably better off creating a \f(CW\*(C`view\*(C'\fR in your
database, and using that as your source. A \f(CW\*(C`view\*(C'\fR is a stored \s-1SQL\s0
query, which can be accessed similarly to a table, see your database
documentation for details.
.IP ".. search with an \s-1SQL\s0 function on the left hand side?" 4
.IX Item ".. search with an SQL function on the left hand side?"
To use an \s-1SQL\s0 function on the left hand side of a comparison you currently need
to resort to literal \s-1SQL:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& \->search( \e[ \*(AqYEAR(date_of_birth) = ?\*(Aq, 1979 ] );
.Ve
.IP ".. find more help on constructing searches?" 4
.IX Item ".. find more help on constructing searches?"
Behind the scenes, DBIx::Class uses SQL::Abstract to help construct
its \s-1SQL\s0 searches. So if you fail to find help in the
DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook, try looking in the SQL::Abstract
documentation.
.IP ".. make searches in Oracle (10gR2 and newer) case-insensitive?" 4
.IX Item ".. make searches in Oracle (10gR2 and newer) case-insensitive?"
To make Oracle behave like most \s-1RDBMS\s0 use on_connect_do to issue
alter session statements on database connection establishment:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\& \->on_connect_do("ALTER SESSION SET NLS_COMP = \*(AqLINGUISTIC\*(Aq");
\& \->on_connect_do("ALTER SESSION SET NLS_SORT = \*(Aq<NLS>_CI\*(Aq");
\& e.g.
\& \->on_connect_do("ALTER SESSION SET NLS_SORT = \*(AqBINARY_CI\*(Aq");
\& \->on_connect_do("ALTER SESSION SET NLS_SORT = \*(AqGERMAN_CI\*(Aq");
.Ve
.SS "Fetching data"
.IX Subsection "Fetching data"
.IP ".. fetch as much data as possible in as few select calls as possible?" 4
.IX Item ".. fetch as much data as possible in as few select calls as possible?"
See the prefetch examples in the Cookbook.
.IP ".. fetch a whole column of data instead of a row?" 4
.IX Item ".. fetch a whole column of data instead of a row?"
Call \f(CW\*(C`get_column\*(C'\fR on a DBIx::Class::ResultSet. This returns a
DBIx::Class::ResultSetColumn. See its documentation and the
Cookbook for details.
.IP ".. fetch a formatted column?" 4
.IX Item ".. fetch a formatted column?"
In your table schema class, create a \*(L"private\*(R" column accessor with:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->add_columns(my_column => { accessor => \*(Aq_hidden_my_column\*(Aq });
.Ve
.Sp
Then, in the same class, implement a subroutine called \*(L"my_column\*(R" that
fetches the real value and does the formatting you want.
.Sp
See the Cookbook for more details.
.IP ".. fetch a single (or topmost) row?" 4
.IX Item ".. fetch a single (or topmost) row?"
Use the \*(L"rows\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet and
\&\*(L"order_by\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet attributes to order your data and
pick off a single row.
.Sp
See also \*(L"Retrieve one and only one row from a resultset\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook.
.Sp
A less readable way is to ask a regular search to return 1 row, using
\&\*(L"slice\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  \->search\->(undef, { order_by => "id DESC" })\->slice(0)
.Ve
.Sp
which (if supported by the database) will use \s-1LIMIT/OFFSET\s0 to hint to the
database that we really only need one row. This can result in a significant
speed improvement. The method using \*(L"single\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet mentioned
in the cookbook can do the same if you pass a \f(CW\*(C`rows\*(C'\fR attribute to the search.
.IP ".. refresh a row from storage?" 4
.IX Item ".. refresh a row from storage?"
Use \*(L"discard_changes\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Row.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $result\->discard_changes
.Ve
.Sp
Discarding changes and refreshing from storage are two sides of the same coin.  When you
want to discard your local changes, just re-fetch the row from storage.  When you want
to get a new, fresh copy of the row, just re-fetch the row from storage.
\&\*(L"discard_changes\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Row does just that by re-fetching the row from storage
using the row's primary key.
.ie n .IP ".. fetch my data a ""page"" at a time?" 4
.el .IP ".. fetch my data a ``page'' at a time?" 4
.IX Item ".. fetch my data a page at a time?"
Pass the \f(CW\*(C`rows\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`page\*(C'\fR attributes to your search, eg:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  \->search({}, { rows => 10, page => 1});
.Ve
.IP ".. get a count of all rows even when paging?" 4
.IX Item ".. get a count of all rows even when paging?"
Call \f(CW\*(C`pager\*(C'\fR on the paged resultset, it will return a Data::Page
object. Calling \f(CW\*(C`total_entries\*(C'\fR on the pager will return the correct
total.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`count\*(C'\fR on the resultset will only return the total number in the page.
.SS "Inserting and updating data"
.IX Subsection "Inserting and updating data"
.IP ".. insert a row with an auto incrementing primary key?" 4
.IX Item ".. insert a row with an auto incrementing primary key?"
This happens automatically. After
creating a result object, the primary
key value created by your database can be fetched by calling \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR (or
the access of your primary key column) on the object.
.IP ".. insert a row with a primary key that uses a sequence?" 4
.IX Item ".. insert a row with a primary key that uses a sequence?"
You need to create a trigger in your database that updates your
primary key field from the sequence. To help PK::Auto find the next
key value, you can tell it the name of the sequence in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`column_info\*(C'\fR supplied with \f(CW\*(C`add_columns\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& \->add_columns({ id => { sequence => \*(Aqmysequence\*(Aq, auto_nextval => 1 } });
.Ve
.IP ".. insert many rows of data efficiently?" 4
.IX Item ".. insert many rows of data efficiently?"
The \f(CW\*(C`populate\*(C'\fR method in DBIx::Class::ResultSet provides
efficient bulk inserts.
.Sp
DBIx::Class::Fixtures provides an alternative way to do this.
.IP ".. update a collection of rows at the same time?" 4
.IX Item ".. update a collection of rows at the same time?"
Create a resultset using a \f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR, to filter the rows of data you
would like to update, then call \f(CW\*(C`update\*(C'\fR on the resultset to change all
the rows at once.
.IP ".. use database functions when updating rows?" 4
.IX Item ".. use database functions when updating rows?"
.PD 0
.IP ".. update a column using data from another column?" 4
.IX Item ".. update a column using data from another column?"
.PD
To stop the column name from being quoted, you'll need to tell \s-1DBIC\s0
that the right hand side is an \s-1SQL\s0 identifier (it will be quoted
properly if you have quoting enabled):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& \->update({ somecolumn => { \-ident => \*(Aqothercolumn\*(Aq } })
.Ve
.Sp
This method will not retrieve the new value and put it in your Row
object. To fetch the new value, use the \f(CW\*(C`discard_changes\*(C'\fR method on
the Row.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  # will return the scalar reference:
\&  $result\->somecolumn()
\&
\&  # issue a select using the PK to re\-fetch the row data:
\&  $result\->discard_changes();
\&
\&  # Now returns the correct new value:
\&  $result\->somecolumn()
.Ve
.Sp
To update and refresh at once, chain your calls:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $result\->update({ \*(Aqsomecolumn\*(Aq => { \-ident => \*(Aqothercolumn\*(Aq } })\->discard_changes;
.Ve

You can use DBIx::Class::InflateColumn to accomplish \s-1YAML/JSON\s0 storage transparently.
.Sp
If you want to use \s-1JSON,\s0 then in your table schema class, do the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& use JSON;
\&
\& _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->add_columns(qw/ ... my_column ../)
\& _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->inflate_column(\*(Aqmy_column\*(Aq, {
\&     inflate => sub { jsonToObj(shift) },
\&     deflate => sub { objToJson(shift) },
\& });
.Ve
.Sp
For \s-1YAML,\s0 in your table schema class, do the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& use YAML;
\&
\& _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->add_columns(qw/ ... my_column ../)
\& _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->inflate_column(\*(Aqmy_column\*(Aq, {
\&     inflate => sub { YAML::Load(shift) },
\&     deflate => sub { YAML::Dump(shift) },
\& });
.Ve
.Sp
This technique is an easy way to store supplemental unstructured data in a table. Be
careful not to overuse this capability, however. If you find yourself depending more
and more on some data within the inflated column, then it may be time to factor that
data out.
.SS "Custom methods in Result classes"
.IX Subsection "Custom methods in Result classes"
You can add custom methods that do arbitrary things, even to unrelated tables.
For example, to provide a \f(CW\*(C`$book\->foo()\*(C'\fR method which searches the
cd table, you'd could add this to Book.pm:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  sub foo {
\&    my ($self, $col_data) = @_;
\&    return $self\->result_source\->schema\->resultset(\*(Aqcd\*(Aq)\->search($col_data);
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
And invoke that on any Book Result object like so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $rs = $book\->foo({ title => \*(AqDown to Earth\*(Aq });
.Ve
.PP
When two tables \s-1ARE\s0 related, DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base provides many
methods to find or create data in related tables for you. But if you want to
write your own methods, you can.
.PP
For example, to provide a \f(CW\*(C`$book\->foo()\*(C'\fR method to manually implement
what \fIcreate_related()\fR from DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base does, you could
add this to Book.pm:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  sub foo {
\&    my ($self, $relname, $col_data) = @_;
\&    return $self\->related_resultset($relname)\->create($col_data);
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Invoked like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $author = $book\->foo(\*(Aqauthor\*(Aq, { name => \*(AqFred\*(Aq });

.IX Item "How do I store my own (non-db) data in my DBIx::Class objects?"
You can add your own data accessors to your Result classes.
.Sp
One method is to use the built in mk_group_accessors (via Class::Accessor::Grouped)
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        package App::Schema::Result::MyTable;
\&
\&        use parent \*(AqDBIx::Class::Core\*(Aq;
\&
\&        _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->table(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq); #etc
\&        _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->mk_group_accessors(\*(Aqsimple\*(Aq => qw/non_column_data/); # must use simple group
.Ve
.Sp
An another method is to use Moose with your DBIx::Class package.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        package App::Schema::Result::MyTable;
\&
\&        use Moose; # import Moose
\&        use Moose::Util::TypeConstraint; # import Moose accessor type constraints
\&
\&        extends \*(AqDBIx::Class::Core\*(Aq; # Moose changes the way we define our parent (base) package
\&
\&        has \*(Aqnon_column_data\*(Aq => ( is => \*(Aqrw\*(Aq, isa => \*(AqStr\*(Aq ); # define a simple attribute
\&
\&        _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->table(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq); # etc
.Ve
.Sp
With either of these methods the resulting use of the accessor would be
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        my $result;
\&
\&        # assume that somewhere in here $result will get assigned to a MyTable row
\&
\&        $result\->non_column_data(\*(Aqsome string\*(Aq); # would set the non_column_data accessor
\&
\&        # some other stuff happens here
\&
\&        $result\->update(); # would not inline the non_column_data accessor into the update

.IP "How do I use DBIx::Class objects in my \s-1TT\s0 templates?" 4
.IX Item "How do I use DBIx::Class objects in my TT templates?"
Like normal objects, mostly. However you need to watch out for \s-1TT\s0
calling methods in list context. When calling relationship accessors
you will not get resultsets, but a list of all the related objects.
.Sp
Use the \*(L"search_rs\*(R" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet method, or the
relationship accessor methods ending with \*(L"_rs\*(R" to work around this
issue.
.Sp

.Sp
For more info see DBIx::Class::Storage for details of how
to turn on debugging in the environment, pass your own filehandle to
save debug to, or create your own callback.
.IP "Why didn't my search run any \s-1SQL\s0?" 4
.IX Item "Why didn't my search run any SQL?"
DBIx::Class runs the actual \s-1SQL\s0 statement as late as possible, thus
if you create a resultset using \f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR in scalar context, no query
is executed. You can create further resultset refinements by calling
search again or relationship accessors. The \s-1SQL\s0 query is only run when
you ask the resultset for an actual result object.
.IP "How do I deal with tables that lack a primary key?" 4
.IX Item "How do I deal with tables that lack a primary key?"
If your table lacks a primary key, DBIx::Class can't work out which row
it should operate on, for example to delete or update.  However, a
\&\s-1UNIQUE\s0 constraint on one or more columns allows DBIx::Class to uniquely
identify the row, so you can tell DBIx::Class::ResultSource these
columns act as a primary key, even if they don't from the database's
point of view:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& $resultset\->set_primary_key(@column);

.IP "How do I override a run time method (e.g. a relationship accessor)?" 4
.IX Item "How do I override a run time method (e.g. a relationship accessor)?"
If you need access to the original accessor, then you must \*(L"wrap around\*(R" the original method.
You can do that either with Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers or Class::Method::Modifiers.
The code example works for both modules:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    package Your::Schema::Group;
\&    use Class::Method::Modifiers;
\&
\&    # ... declare columns ...
\&
\&    _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->has_many(\*(Aqgroup_servers\*(Aq, \*(AqYour::Schema::GroupServer\*(Aq, \*(Aqgroup_id\*(Aq);
\&    _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->many_to_many(\*(Aqservers\*(Aq, \*(Aqgroup_servers\*(Aq, \*(Aqserver\*(Aq);
\&
\&    # if the server group is a "super group", then return all servers
\&    # otherwise return only servers that belongs to the given group
\&    around \*(Aqservers\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my $orig = shift;
\&        my $self = shift;
\&
\&        return $self\->$orig(@_) unless $self\->is_super_group;
\&        return $self\->result_source\->schema\->resultset(\*(AqServer\*(Aq)\->all;
\&    };
.Ve
.Sp
If you just want to override the original method, and don't care about the data
from the original accessor, then you have two options. Either use
Method::Signatures::Simple that does most of the work for you, or do
it the \*(L"dirty way\*(R".
.Sp
Method::Signatures::Simple way:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    package Your::Schema::Group;
\&    use Method::Signatures::Simple;
\&
\&    # ... declare columns ...
\&
\&    _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->has_many(\*(Aqgroup_servers\*(Aq, \*(AqYour::Schema::GroupServer\*(Aq, \*(Aqgroup_id\*(Aq);
\&    _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->many_to_many(\*(Aqservers\*(Aq, \*(Aqgroup_servers\*(Aq, \*(Aqserver\*(Aq);
\&
\&    # The method keyword automatically injects the annoying my $self = shift; for you.
\&    method servers {
\&        return $self\->result_source\->schema\->resultset(\*(AqServer\*(Aq)\->search({ ... });
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp

Parse::Eyapp::debuggingtut \- Solving ambiguities and fixing lexical, syntactic and semantic errors
.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.IX Header "INTRODUCTION"
The sources of error when programming 
with \f(CW\*(C`eyapp\*(C'\fR are many and various. 
Some of them are minor, as having a 
nonterminal without production rules or a terminal
that is never produced by the lexical analyzer. These kind of errors
can be caught with the help of the \f(CW%strict\fR directive.
.PP
In the following 
sections we will discuss three main kind 
of errors that correspond to three development
stages:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Conflict errors:
.Sp
Conflicts with the grammar: the grammar is ambiguous or
is not clear \- perhaps due to the fact that \f(CW\*(C`eyapp\*(C'\fR
uses only a lookahead symbol \- which sort of tree must be built for
some inputs
.IP "\(bu" 2
Tree building errors:
.Sp
There are no conflicts but the parser does not build the syntax
tree as expected. May be it rejects correct sentences
or accepts incorrect ones. Or may be it accepts correct ones but
the syntax tree has not the shape we want (i.e. we have a precedence
problem).
.IP "\(bu" 2
Semantic errors:
.Sp
We have solved the conflicts and trees are satisfactory but
we have errors inside the semantic actions.
.PP
Each time you discover an error write a test that covers that
error. Section \*(L"\s-1TREE EQUALITY\*(R"\s0 deals with the problem of
checking if the generated abstract syntax tree 
has the correct shape and attributes.
.PP
As Andreas Zeller points out in his article \*(L"Beautiful Debugging\*(R" 
finding the causes of a failing program must follow the scientific method:
.IP "1. Observe the failure (there are conflicts or ambiguity, there are precedence problems, there are semantic errors, the output is wrong)" 2
.IX Item "1. Observe the failure (there are conflicts or ambiguity, there are precedence problems, there are semantic errors, the output is wrong)"
.PD 0

.ie n .SH "THE %strict DIRECTIVE"
.el .SH "THE \f(CW%strict\fP DIRECTIVE"
.IX Header "THE %strict DIRECTIVE"
By default, identifiers appearing in the rule section
will be classified as terminal if they don't appear 
in the left hand side of any production rules.
.PP
The directive \f(CW%strict\fR forces the declaration of all tokens. 
The following \f(CW\*(C`eyapp\*(C'\fR program issues a warning:

.SH "CONFLICTS AND AMBIGUITIES"
.IX Header "CONFLICTS AND AMBIGUITIES"
.SS "Understanding Priorities"
.IX Subsection "Understanding Priorities"
Token and production priorities are used to solve conflicts.
Recall the main points of yacc-like parsers related to priorities:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The directives
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&            %left
\&            %right
\&            %nonassoc
.Ve
.Sp
can be used in the head section to declare the priority of a token
.IP "\(bu" 2
The later the declaration line the higher the priority
.IP "\(bu" 2
The precedence of a production rule (right hand side) is the precedence
of the last token in the right hand side
.IP "\(bu" 2
In a shift-reduce conflict the default action is to shift. This action can be changed
if the production and the token have explicit priorities
.IP "\(bu" 2
If the precedence of the production rule is higher the shift-reduce conflict is solved 
in favor of the reduction
.IP "\(bu" 2
If the precedence of the token is higher the shift-reduce conflict is solved 
in favor of the shift
.IP "\(bu" 2
If the precedence of the token is the same than the precedence of the rule, and is left 
the shift-reduce conflict is solved in favor of the reduction
.IP "\(bu" 2
If the precedence of the token is the same than the precedence of the rule, and is right 
the shift-reduce conflict is solved in favor of the shift
.IP "\(bu" 2
If the precedence of the token is the same than the precedence of the rule, and is nonassoc 
the presence of a shift-reduce conflict means an error.
This is used to describe operators, like the operator \f(CW\*(C`.LT.\*(C'\fR in \s-1FORTRAN, \s0
that may not associate with themselves. That is, because
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&                             A .LT. B .LT. C
.Ve
.Sp
is invalid in \s-1FORTRAN, \s0\f(CW\*(C`.LT.\*(C'\fR would be described with the keyword \f(CW%nonassoc\fR in eyapp.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The default precedence of a production can be changed using the \f(CW\*(C`%prec TOKEN\*(C'\fR directive.
Now the rule has the precedence and associativity of the specified \f(CW\*(C`TOKEN\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The program \f(CW\*(C`Precedencia.eyp\*(C'\fR illustrates the way priorities work in \f(CW\*(C`eyapp\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 5

The parser generated by \f(CW\*(C`Parse::Eyapp\*(C'\fR
is based on a \fIdeterministic finite automaton\fR. 
Each state of the automaton \fIremembers\fR what production rules
are candidates to apply and what have been seen
from the right hand side of the production rule. 
The problem, according to the warning, occurs in state 4.
State 4 contains:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    55  State 4:
\&    56
\&    57          ds \-> D . \*(Aq;\*(Aq ds        (Rule 3)
\&    58          ds \-> D .       (Rule 4)
\&    59

\&    62          \*(Aq;\*(Aq     [reduce using rule 4 (ds)]
\&    63
.Ve
.PP
An state is a set of production rules with a marker 
(the dot in rules 3 and 4)
somewhere in its right hand side. 
If the parser is in state 4 
is because the production rules \f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D \*(Aq;\*(Aq ds\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D\*(C'\fR are potential candidates 
to build the syntax tree. That they will win or not
depends on what will happen next when more
input is processed.
.PP
The dot that appears on the right hand side 
means \fIposition\fR in our guessing. The fact
that \f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D .\*(Aq;\*(Aq ds\*(C'\fR
is in state 4 means that if the parser is in state 4 we have already seen 
\&\f(CW\*(C`D\*(C'\fR  and we 
expect to see a semicolon followed by \f(CW\*(C`ds\*(C'\fR (or something
derivable from \f(CW\*(C`ds\*(C'\fR). If such thing happens 
this production will be the right one (will be the \fIhandle\fR
in the jargon). The comment
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    60          \*(Aq;\*(Aq     shift, and go to state 8
.Ve
.PP
means that if the next token is a semicolon the next state
will be state 8:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    84  State 8:
\&    85
\&    86          ds \-> D \*(Aq;\*(Aq . ds        (Rule 3)
\&    87
\&    88          D       shift, and go to state 4
\&    89
\&    90          ds      go to state 11
.Ve
.PP
As we see state 8 has the item \f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D \*(Aq;\*(Aq . ds\*(C'\fR which
means that we have already seen a \f(CW\*(C`D\*(C'\fR and a semicolon.
.PP
The fact that \f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D .\*(C'\fR is in state 4 means that we have already seen 
\&\f(CW\*(C`D\*(C'\fR and since the dot is at the end of the rule,
this production can be the right one, even if
a semicolon is just waiting in the input. 
An example that it will be correct to \*(L"reduce\*(R" by the rule
\&\f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D .\*(C'\fR in the presence of a semicolon is given by the
input \f(CW\*(C`D ; S\*(C'\fR. A rightmost derivation for such input is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  p => ds ; ss => ds ; S => D ; S
.Ve
.PP
that is processed by the \s-1\fILALR\s0\fR\|(1) algorithm 
following this sequence of actions:
.PP
.Vb 10

.PP
Since it is correct to reduce in some cases
by the production \f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D .\*(C'\fR
and others in which is correct to shift the semicolon,
\&\f(CW\*(C`eyapp\*(C'\fR complains about a shift/reduce 
conflict with \f(CW\*(Aq;\*(Aq\fR. State 4 has two
rules that compete to be the right one:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ eyapp Debug.eyp
\&  1 shift/reduce conflict (see .output file)
.Ve
.PP
We can guess that the right item (the rules with the dot, i.e. the states 
of the automaton are called \s-1\fILALR\s0\fR\|(0) items in the yacc jargon)  is 
\&\f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D .\*(Aq;\*(Aq ds\*(C'\fR and 
\&\fIshift to state 8\fR consuming the semicolon,
expecting to see something derivable from \f(CW\*(C`ds\*(C'\fR later
or guess that  \f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D .\*(C'\fR is the right \s-1\fILR\s0\fR\|(0) item
and \fIreduce\fR for such rule. This is the meaning of the comments in 
state 4:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    60          \*(Aq;\*(Aq     shift, and go to state 8
\&    61
\&    62          \*(Aq;\*(Aq     [reduce using rule 4 (ds)]
.Ve
.PP
To illustrate the problem let us consider the phrases
\&\f(CW\*(C`D;S\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`D;D;S\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For both phrases, after consuming the \f(CW\*(C`D\*(C'\fR 
the parser will go to state 4 and the current token will be the semicolon.
.PP
For the first phrase 
\&\f(CW\*(C`D;S\*(C'\fR the correct decision
is to use rule 4 \f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D\*(C'\fR (to \fIreduce\fR in the jargon).
For the second phrase 
\&\f(CW\*(C`D;D;S\*(C'\fR the correct decision is to follow rule 3
\&\f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D . \*(Aq;\*(Aq ds\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The parser generated by \f(CW\*(C`eyapp\*(C'\fR would be able to know 
which rule is correct for each
case if it were allowed to look at the token after the semicolon:
if it is a \f(CW\*(C`S\*(C'\fR is rule 4, if it is a \f(CW\*(C`D\*(C'\fR is rule 3.
But the parsers generated by \f(CW\*(C`Eyapp\*(C'\fR do not lookahead more than the
next token (this is what the \*(L"1\*(R" means when we say that 
\&\f(CW\*(C`Parse::Eyapp\*(C'\fR parsers are \s-1\fILALR\s0\fR\|(1)) and therefore
is not in condition to decide which production rule applies.
.PP
Unfortunately this is the sort of conflict that can't be solved
by assigning priorities to the productions and tokens 
as it was done for the calculator example 
in Parse::Eyapp::eyappintro. If we run the analyzer
it will refuse to accept correct entries like \f(CW\*(C`D;D;S\*(C'\fR:

\&  ss:

.PP
do not also produce a shift-reduce conflict with the semicolon. This is because the reduction
by \f(CW\*(C`ss \-> S\*(C'\fR always corresponds to the last \f(CW\*(C`S\*(C'\fR in a derivation:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   ss => S ; ss => S ; S ; ss => S ; S; S
.Ve
.PP
and thus, the reduction by \f(CW\*(C`ss \-> S\*(C'\fR only occurs in the presence
of the \f(CW\*(C`end of input\*(C'\fR token and never with the semicolon. 
The \s-1FOLLOW\s0 set of a syntactic variable 
is the set of tokens that may appear next to such variable
in some derivation. While the semicolon \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR is in the \s-1FOLLOW\s0 of \f(CW\*(C`dd\*(C'\fR,
it isn't in the \s-1FOLLOW\s0 of \f(CW\*(C`ss\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Solving Shift-Reduce Conflicts by Factorizing"
.IX Subsection "Solving Shift-Reduce Conflicts by Factorizing"
To solve the former conflict the \f(CW\*(C`Eyapp\*(C'\fR programmer
has to reformulate the grammar modifying
priorities and reorganizing the rules.
Rewriting the recursive rule for \f(CW\*(C`ds\*(C'\fR to
be let recursive solves the conflict:

.PP
Now, for any phrase matching the pattern \f(CW\*(C`D ; ...\*(C'\fR the action to build
the tree is to reduce by
\&\f(CW\*(C`ds \-> D\*(C'\fR.

The rightmost reverse derivation for \f(CW\*(C`D;D;S\*(C'\fR is:

The problem here is that \f(CW\*(C`Eyapp/Yapp/Yacc\*(C'\fR etc. produce \s-1\fILALR\s0\fR\|(1) parsers.
They only look the next token. 
We can decide how to solve the conflict by rewriting the lexical analyzer 
to peer forward what token comes after the semicolon: it now returns
\&\f(CW\*(C`SEMICOLONS\*(C'\fR if it is an \f(CW\*(C`S\*(C'\fR and

the parser receives an end of file. XWhy?.
Something is going wrong in the communications between lexical analyzer
and parser. Let us review the lexical analyzer:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/debuggingtut$ sed \-ne \*(Aq/lexer/,/^)/p\*(Aq Debug1.eyp | cat \-n
\&     1  _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->lexer(

\&     5      for (${$self\->input()}) {  # contextualize
\&     6          s{^(\es)}{} and $self\->tokenline($1 =~ tr{\en}{});
\&     7
\&     8          return (\*(Aq\*(Aq, undef) unless $_;
\&     9          return ($1, $1) if s/^(.)//;
\&    10      }
\&    11      return (\*(Aq\*(Aq, undef);
\&    12    }
\&    13  );
.Ve
.PP
The error is at line 6. Only a single white space is eaten!
The second carraige return in the input does not match lines 8 and 9 and the 
contextualizing \f(CW\*(C`for\*(C'\fR finishes. Line 11 then unconditionally returns
the \f(CW\*(C`(\*(Aq\*(Aq,undef)\*(C'\fR signaling the end of input.
.PP
The grammar in file \f(CW\*(C`Debug2.eyp\*(C'\fR fixes the problem:
Now the analysis seems to work for this kind of input:

.IX Header "THE LR PARSING ALGORITHM: UNDERSTANDING THE OUTPUT OF yydebug"
The \f(CW\*(C`YYParse\*(C'\fR methods implements the generic \s-1LR\s0 parsing algorithm.
It very much works \f(CW\*(C`Parse::Yapp::YYParse\*(C'\fR and as yacc/bison \f(CW\*(C`yyparse\*(C'\fR.
It accepts almost the same arguments as \f(CW\*(C`Class\->new\*(C'\fR (Being \f(CW\*(C`Class\*(C'\fR the name 
of the generated class).
.PP
The parser uses two tables and a stack. The two tables
are called the \fIaction\fR table and the \fIgoto\fR table.
The stack is used to keep track of the states visited.
.PP
At each step the generated parser consults the 
\&\f(CW\*(C`action\*(C'\fR table and takes one decision:
To shift to a new state consuming one token (and pushing 
the current state in the stack) or to reduce by some
production rule. In the last case the parser pops
from its stack as many states as symbols are on the right hand side
of the production rule. Here is a Perl/C like pseudocode
summarizing the activity of \f(CW\*(C`YYParse\*(C'\fR:
.PP

Here \f(CW\*(C`|alpha|\*(C'\fR stands for the length of \f(CW\*(C`alpha\*(C'\fR. Function \f(CWtop(k)\fR returns
the state in position \f(CW\*(C`k\*(C'\fR from the top of the stack, i.e. the state at depth \f(CW\*(C`k\*(C'\fR.
Function \f(CWpop(k)\fR extracts \f(CW\*(C`k\*(C'\fR states from the stack. The call \f(CW\*(C`$state\->attr\*(C'\fR
returns the attribute associated with \f(CW$state\fR. The call \f(CW\*(C`$parser\->Semantic{A \->alpha}\*(C'\fR
returns the semantic action associated with production \f(CW\*(C`A \->alpha\*(C'\fR.

A third type of error occurs when the code inside

The semantic actions are translated in anonymous

we can't use breakpoints as

introduces a problem that arises in the declaration of enumerated 
and subrange types in Pascal:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  type subrange = lo .. hi;
\&  type enum = (a, b, c);
.Ve
.PP
The original language standard allows only numeric literals and constant
identifiers for the subrange bounds (`lo' and `hi'), but Extended Pascal
and many other Pascal implementations allow arbitrary expressions there. This
gives rise to the following situation, containing a superfluous pair of
parentheses:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     type subrange = (a) .. b;
.Ve
.PP
Compare this to the following declaration of an enumerated type with only one value:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&      type enum = (a);
.Ve
.PP
These two declarations look identical until the \f(CW\*(C`..\*(C'\fR token. With normal \s-1\fILALR\s0\fR\|(1)
one-token look-ahead it is not possible to decide between the two forms when
the identifier \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR is parsed. It is, however, desirable for a parser to decide
this, since in the latter case \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR must become a new identifier to represent
the enumeration value, while in the former case \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR must be evaluated with its
current meaning, which may be a constant or even a function call.
.PP
The consequence is a reduce-reduce conflict, which is summarized in
this state of the \s-1LALR\s0 automata:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  State 10:
\&
\&    id_list \-> ID . (Rule 4)
\&    expr \-> ID .    (Rule 11)
\&
\&    \*(Aq)\*(Aq [reduce using rule 11 (expr)]
\&    \*(Aq)\*(Aq reduce using rule 4 (id_list)
\&    \*(Aq,\*(Aq reduce using rule 4 (id_list)
\&    $default    reduce using rule 11 (expr)
.Ve
.PP
The grammar in file \f(CW\*(C`pascalenumeratedvsrangesolvedvialex.eyp\*(C'\fR solves
this particular problem by looking ahead in the lexical analyzer: if the parenthesis
is followed by a sequence of comma separated identifiers finished by the closing 
parenthesis and a semicolon we can conclude that is a enumerated type 
declaration. For more details, have a look at the file. Another solution
using the postponed conflict resolution strategy can be found in file
\&\f(CW\*(C`pascalenumeratedvsrangesolvedviadyn.eyp\*(C'\fR.

This non ambiguous grammar generates a language of sequences like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&                 a, b : e f : e,
.Ve
.PP
The conflict is due to the final comma in:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&      def:    param_spec return_spec \*(Aq,\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
If you suppress such comma there is no conflict (try it).
When compiling with eyapp we get the warning:
.PP
.Vb 2

\&  1 reduce/reduce conflict
.Ve
.PP
Editing the \f(CW\*(C`.output\*(C'\fR file we can see the conflict is in state 2:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&   46 State 2:
\&   47
\&   48         name \-> VAR .   (Rule 6)

\&   53         $default        reduce using rule 6 (name)
.Ve
.PP
If we look at the grammar we can see that a reduction by
.PP
.Vb 1
\&                   type \-> VAR .
.Ve
.PP
may occur with a comma as incoming token but only after 
the reduction by \f(CW\*(C`param_spec\*(C'\fR has taken place. The problem
is that the automaton forgets about it. Look the 
automaton transitions in the \f(CW\*(C`.outputfile\*(C'\fR.
By making explicit the difference between the first and second \f(CW\*(C`type\*(C'\fR
we solve the conflict:

.SH "TOKENS DEPENDING ON THE SYNTACTIC CONTEXT"
.IX Header "TOKENS DEPENDING ON THE SYNTACTIC CONTEXT"
Usually there is a one-to-one relation between a token and a regexp. Problems arise,
however when a token's type depends upon contextual information.
An example of this problem comes from \s-1PL/I,\s0 where statements like this are
legal:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&         if then=if then if=then
.Ve
.PP
In \s-1PL/I\s0 this problem arises because keywords like \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR are not reserved and can be used in
other contexts. This simplified grammar illustrates the problem:
.PP
.Vb 12
\&  examples/debuggingtut$ eyapp \-c PL_I_conflict.eyp
\&  # This grammar deals with the famous ambiguous PL/I phrase:
\&  #                if then=if then if=then
\&  # The (partial) solution uses YYExpect in the lexical analyzer to predict the token
\&  # that fulfills the parser expectatives.
\&  # Compile it with:
\&  # eyapp \-b \*(Aq\*(Aq PL_I_conflict.eyp
\&  # Run it with;
\&  # ./PL_I_conflict.pm \-debug
\&  %strict
\&  %token ID
\&  %tree bypass
\&
\&  %%
\&
\&  stmt:
\&        ifstmt
\&      | assignstmt
\&  ;
\&  # Exercise: change this production
\&  #     for \*(Aqif\*(Aq expr \*(Aqthen\*(Aq stmt
\&  # and check with input \*(Aqif then=if then if=then\*(Aq. The problem arises again
\&  ifstmt:
\&        %name IF
\&        \*(Aqif\*(Aq expr \*(Aqthen\*(Aq expr
\&  ;
\&  assignstmt:
\&        id \*(Aq=\*(Aq expr
\&  ;
\&  expr:
\&        %name EQ
\&        id \*(Aq=\*(Aq id
\&      | id
\&  ;
\&  id:
\&        %name ID
\&        ID
\&  ;
\&
\&  %%
.Ve
.PP
If the token ambiguity depends only in the syntactic context,
the problem can be alleviated using the \f(CW\*(C`YYExpect\*(C'\fR method. 
In case of doubt, the lexical analyzer calls the \f(CW\*(C`YYExpect\*(C'\fR method to know
which of the several feasible tokens is expected by the parser:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  examples/debuggingtut$ sed \-ne \*(Aq/sub lex/,/^}/p\*(Aq PL_I_conflict.eyp
\&  sub lexer {
\&    my $parser = shift;
\&
\&    for ($parser\->{input}) {    # contextualize
\&      m{\eG\es*(\e#.*)?}gc;
\&
\&      m{\eG([a\-zA\-Z_]\ew*)}gc and do {
\&        my $id = $1;
\&
\&        return (\*(Aqif\*(Aq,   \*(Aqif\*(Aq)   if ($id eq \*(Aqif\*(Aq)   && is_in(\*(Aqif\*(Aq, $parser\->YYExpect);
\&        return (\*(Aqthen\*(Aq, \*(Aqthen\*(Aq) if ($id eq \*(Aqthen\*(Aq) && is_in(\*(Aqthen\*(Aq, $parser\->YYExpect);
\&
\&        return (\*(AqID\*(Aq, $id);
\&      };
\&
\&      m{\eG(.)}gc         and return ($1, $1);
\&
\&      return(\*(Aq\*(Aq,undef);
\&    }
\&  }

.SH "LEXICAL TIE-INS"
.IX Header "LEXICAL TIE-INS"
A \fIlexical tie-in\fR is a flag which is set to alter the behavior of the 
lexical analyzer. It is a way to handle context-dependency.
.ie n .SS "The Parsing of ""C"""
.el .SS "The Parsing of \f(CWC\fP"
.IX Subsection "The Parsing of C"
The C language has a context dependency: the way an identifier is used depends
on what its current meaning is. For example, consider this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  T(x);
.Ve
.PP
This looks like a function call statement, but if \f(CW\*(C`T\*(C'\fR is a typedef name, then
this is actually a declaration of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR. How can a parser for C decide how to
parse this input?
.PP
Here is another example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  {
\&    T * x;
\&    ...
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
What is this, a declaration of \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR as a pointer to \f(CW\*(C`T\*(C'\fR, 
or a void multiplication of the variables \f(CW\*(C`T\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR?
.PP
The usual method to solve this problem is to have two different token types, \f(CW\*(C`ID\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`TYPENAME\*(C'\fR.
When the lexical analyzer finds an identifier, it looks up in the symbol table 
the current declaration of the identifier in order to 
decide which token type to return: \f(CW\*(C`TYPENAME\*(C'\fR if the
identifier is declared as a typedef, \f(CW\*(C`ID\*(C'\fR otherwise.
See the \s-1ANSI C\s0 parser example in the directory \f(CW\*(C`examples/languages/C/ansic.eyp\*(C'\fR
.SS "A Simple Example"
.IX Subsection "A Simple Example"
In the \*(L"Calc\*(R"\-like example in \f(CW\*(C`examples/debuggintut/SemanticInfoInTokens.eyp\*(C'\fR
we have a language with a special construct 
\&\f(CW\*(C`hex (hex\-expr)\*(C'\fR. After the keyword \f(CW\*(C`hex\*(C'\fR comes an \f(CW\*(C`expression\*(C'\fR in parentheses in
which all integers are hexadecimal. In particular, strings in \f(CW\*(C`/[A\-F0\-9]+/\*(C'\fR
like \f(CW\*(C`A1B\*(C'\fR must be treated as an hex integer unless they were previously
declared as variables.  Let us see an example of execution:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  $ eyapp \-b \*(Aq\*(Aq SemanticInfoInTokens.eyp
\&  $ cat inputforsemanticinfo2.txt
\&  int A2
\&  A2 = HEX(A23);
\&  A2 = HEX(A2)
\&
\&  $ ./SemanticInfoInTokens.pm \-f inputforsemanticinfo2.txt  \-t
\&  EXPS(ASSIGN(TERMINAL[A2],NUM[2595]),ASSIGN(TERMINAL[A2],ID[A2]))
.Ve
.PP
The first hex expression \f(CW\*(C`HEX(A23)\*(C'\fR is interpreted as the number \f(CW2595\fR
while the second \f(CW\*(C`HEX(A2)\*(C'\fR refers to previously declared variable \f(CW\*(C`A2\*(C'\fR.
.PP
An alternative solution to this problem that does not make use of
lexical tie-ins \- but still uses an attribute \f(CW\*(C`HEXFLAG\*(C'\fR for communication
between different semantic actions \- can be found in the file 
\&\f(CW\*(C`examples/debuggintut/Tieins.eyp\*(C'\fR.

Here the lexical analyzer looks at the value of the attribute \f(CW\*(C`HEXFLAG\*(C'\fR; when it is nonzero,
all integers are parsed in hexadecimal, and tokens starting with letters are
parsed as integers if possible.

.SH "SOLVING CONFLICTS WITH THE \fIPOSTPONED CONFLICT\fP STRATEGY"
.IX Header "SOLVING CONFLICTS WITH THE POSTPONED CONFLICT STRATEGY"
Yacc-like parser generators provide ways to solve shift-reduce mechanims
based on token precedence. No mechanisms are provided for the resolution
of reduce-reduce conflicts. The solution for such kind of conflicts is to modify
the grammar. The strategy We present here provides a way to broach conflicts
that can't be solved using static precedences.
.SS "The \fIPostponed Conflict Resolution\fP Strategy"
.IX Subsection "The Postponed Conflict Resolution Strategy"
The \fIpostponed conflict strategy\fR presented here can be used whenever there 
is a shift-reduce or reduce-reduce conflict that can not be solved using static 
precedences.
.SS "\fIPostponed Conflict Resolution\fP: Reduce-Reduce Conflicts"
.IX Subsection "Postponed Conflict Resolution: Reduce-Reduce Conflicts"
Let us assume we have a reduce-reduce conflict between to productions
.PP
.Vb 2
\&                      A \-> alpha .
\&                      B \-> beta .
.Ve
.PP
for some token \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR. Let also assume that production
.PP
.Vb 1
\&                      A \-> alpha
.Ve
.PP
has name \f(CW\*(C`ruleA\*(C'\fR and production
.PP
.Vb 1
\&                      B \-> beta
.Ve
.PP
has name \f(CW\*(C`ruleB\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The postponed conflict resolution strategy consists
in modifying the conflictive grammar by marking the points where the  conflict occurs
with the new \f(CW%PREC\fR directive. In this case at then end of the involved productions:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&                      A \-> alpha %PREC IsAorB 
\&                      B \-> beta  $PREC IsAorB
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`IsAorB\*(C'\fR identifier is called the \fIconflict name\fR.
.PP
Inside the head section, the programmer associates with the 
conflict name a code
whose mission is to solve the conflict by dynamically changing the
parsing table like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&                     %conflict IsAorB {
\&                          my $self = shift;
\&
\&                          if (looks_like_A($self)) {
\&                            $self\->YYSetReduce(\*(Aq@\*(Aq, \*(AqruleA\*(Aq );
\&                          }
\&                          else {
\&                            $self\->YYSetReduce(\*(Aq@\*(Aq, \*(AqruleB\*(Aq );
\&                          }
\&                       }
.Ve
.PP
The code associated with the \fIconflict name\fR
receives the name of \fI conflict handler\fR.
The code of \f(CW\*(C`looks_like_A\*(C'\fR stands for some form of nested parsing
which will decide which production applies.

.SH "TREE EQUALITY"
.IX Header "TREE EQUALITY"
The more the time invested writing tests the less the time spent debugging.
This section deals with the Parse::Eyapp::Node method \f(CW\*(C`equal\*(C'\fR which 
can be used to test that the trees have the shape we expect.
.ie n .SS "$node\->equal"
.el .SS "\f(CW$node\fP\->equal"
.IX Subsection "$node->equal"
A call  \f(CW\*(C`$tree1\->equal($tree2)\*(C'\fR  
compare the two trees \f(CW$tree1\fR and \f(CW$tree2\fR. 
Two trees are considered equal if their root nodes belong to the same class,
they have the same number of children and the children are (recursively) equal.
.PP
In Addition to the two trees the programmer can specify
pairs \f(CW\*(C`attribute_key => equality_handler\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $tree1\->equal($tree2, attr1 => \e&handler1, attr2 => \e&handler2, ...)
.Ve
.PP
In such case 
the definition of equality is more restrictive:
Two trees are considered equal if
.IP "\(bu" 2
Their root nodes belong to the same class,
.IP "\(bu" 2
They have the same number of children
.IP "\(bu" 2
For each of the specified attributes occur
that for both nodes the existence and definition of the key
is the same
.IP "\(bu" 2
Assuming the key exists and is defined for both 
nodes, the equality handlers return
true for each of its attributes and
.IP "\(bu" 2
The respective children are (recursively) equal.
.PP
An attribute handler receives as arguments the values of the attributes
of the two nodes being compared and must return true if, and only if,
these two attributes are considered equal. Follows an example:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  examples/Node$ cat \-n equal.pl
\&     1  #!/usr/bin/perl \-w
\&     2  use strict;
\&     3  use Parse::Eyapp::Node;
\&     4
\&     5  my $string1 = shift || \*(AqASSIGN(VAR(TERMINAL))\*(Aq;
\&     6  my $string2 = shift || \*(AqASSIGN(VAR(TERMINAL))\*(Aq;
\&     7  my $t1 = Parse::Eyapp::Node\->new($string1, sub { my $i = 0; $_\->{n} = $i++ for @_ });
\&     8  my $t2 = Parse::Eyapp::Node\->new($string2);
\&     9
\&    10  # Without attributes
\&    11  if ($t1\->equal($t2)) {
\&    12    print "\enNot considering attributes: Equal\en";
\&    13  }
\&    14  else {
\&    15    print "\enNot considering attributes: Not Equal\en";
\&    16  }
\&    17
\&    18  # Equality with attributes
\&    19  if ($t1\->equal($t2, n => sub { return $_[0] == $_[1] })) {
\&    20    print "\enConsidering attributes: Equal\en";
\&    21  }
\&    22  else {
\&    23    print "\enConsidering attributes: Not Equal\en";
\&    24  }

When the former program is run without arguments produces the following
output:

.ie n .SS "Using ""equal"" During Testing"
.el .SS "Using \f(CWequal\fP During Testing"
.IX Subsection "Using equal During Testing"
During the development of your compiler you add new stages
to the existing ones. The consequence is that the \s-1AST\s0 is decorated
with new attributes. Unfortunately, this implies that tests you wrote using 
\&\f(CW\*(C`is_deeply\*(C'\fR and comparisons against formerly correct abstract syntax trees are no longer valid.
This is due to the fact that \f(CW\*(C`is_deeply\*(C'\fR requires both tree structures to be
equivalent in every detail and that our new code produces a tree with new attributes.
.PP
Instead of \f(CW\*(C`is_deeply\*(C'\fR use the \f(CW\*(C`equal\*(C'\fR method to check for partial equivalence between
abstract syntax trees. You can follow these steps:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Dump the tree for the source inserting \f(CW\*(C`Data::Dumper\*(C'\fR statements
.IP "\(bu" 2
Carefully check that the tree is really correct
.IP "\(bu" 2
Decide which attributes will be used for comparison
.IP "\(bu" 2
Write the code for the expected value
editing the output produced by \f(CW\*(C`Data::Dumper\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 2
Write the handlers for the attributes you decided.
Write the comparison using \f(CW\*(C`equal\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Tests using this methodology will not fail even if later code decorating 
the \s-1AST\s0 with new attributes is introduced.
.PP
See an example that checks an abstract syntax tree produced
by the simple compiler (see  \f(CW\*(C`examples/typechecking/Simple\-Types\-XXX.tar.gz\*(C'\fR) 
for a really simple source:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  Simple\-Types/script$ cat prueba27.c
\&  int f() {
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
The first thing is to obtain a description of the tree,
that can be done executing the compiler under the control of
the Perl debugger, stopping just after the 
tree has been built and dumping the tree
with Data::Dumper:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&  pl@nereida:~/Lbook/code/Simple\-Types/script$ perl \-wd usetypes.pl prueba27.c
\&  main::(usetypes.pl:5):  my $filename = shift || die "Usage:\en$0 file.c\en";
\&    DB<1> c 12
\&  main::(usetypes.pl:12): Simple::Types::show_trees($t, $debug);
\&    DB<2> use Data::Dumper
\&    DB<3> $Data::Dumper::Purity = 1
\&    DB<4> p Dumper($t)
\&  $VAR1 = bless( {
\&                   ..............................................
\&                 }, \*(AqPROGRAM\*(Aq );
\&  ...............................................................
.Ve
.PP
Once we have the shape of a correct tree we can write
our tests:
.PP
.Vb 10

The code defining tree \f(CW$t1\fR was obtained from an output using \f(CW\*(C`Data::Dumper\*(C'\fR.
The code for trees \f(CW$t2\fR and \f(CW$t3\fR was written using cut-and-paste from \f(CW$t1\fR.
They have the same shape than \f(CW$t1\fR but differ in their attributes. Tree \f(CW$t2\fR
shares with \f(CW$t1\fR the attributes \f(CW\*(C`symboltable\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`types\*(C'\fR used in the comparison
and so \f(CW\*(C`equal\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`true\*(C'\fR when compared. Since \f(CW$t3\fR differs from \f(CW$t1\fR
in the attributes \f(CW\*(C`symboltable\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`types\*(C'\fR the call to \f(CW\*(C`equal\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR.

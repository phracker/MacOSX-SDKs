Welcome to the official Inline \s-1FAQ.\s0 In this case, \fB\s-1FAQ\s0\fR means:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Formerly Answered Questions
.Ve
.PP
This is a collection of old, long-winded emails that myself and others
have sent to the Inline mailing list. (inline@perl.org) They have been
reviewed and edited for general Inline edification. Some of them may be
related to a specific language. They are presented here in a traditional
\&\s-1FAQ\s0 layout.
.SH "General Inline"
.IX Header "General Inline"
Since there is only a handful of content so far, all FAQs are currently
under this heading.
.SS "How disposable is a .Inline or _Inline directory?"
.IX Subsection "How disposable is a .Inline or _Inline directory?"
I probably need to be more emphatic about the roll of _Inline/ cache
directories. Since they are created automatically, they are completely
disposable. I delete them all the time. And it is fine to have a
different one for each project. In fact as long as you don't have
~/.Inline/ defined, Inline will create a new ./_Inline directory (unless,
you've done something to override this automatic process \- such as
using the \s-1DIRECTORY\s0 config option, or using the \s-1PERL_INLINE_DIRECTORY\s0
environment variable). You can move that to ./.Inline and it will continue
to work if you want togive it more longevity and hide it from view. There
is a long complicated list of rules about how [_.]Inline/ directories are
used/created. But it was designed to give you the most
flexibility/ease\-of\-use. Never be afraid to nuke 'em. They'll just pop
right back next time they're needed. :)
.SS "Whatever happened to the \s-1SITE_INSTALL\s0 option?"
.IX Subsection "Whatever happened to the SITE_INSTALL option?"
\&\s-1SITE_INSTALL\s0 is gone. I was going to leave it in and change the
semantics, but thought it better to remove it, so people wouldn't try to
use it the old way. There is now _INSTALL_ (but you're not supposed to
know that :). It works magically through the use of Inline::MakeMaker. I
explained this earlier but it's worth going through again because it's
the biggest change for 0.40. Here's how to 'permanently' install an
Inline extension (Inline based module) with 0.40:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    1) Create a module with Inline.
\&    2) Test it using the normal/local _Inline/ cache.
\&    3) Create a Makefile.PL (like the one produced by h2xs)
\&    4) Change \*(Aquse ExtUtils::MakeMaker\*(Aq to \*(Aquse Inline::MakeMaker\*(Aq
\&    5) In the Makefile.PL\*(Aqs WriteMakefile() insert:
\&
\&        CONFIGURE_REQUIRES  =>  {
\&            \*(AqInline::MakeMaker\*(Aq     => 0.45,
\&            \*(AqExtUtils::MakeMaker\*(Aq   => 6.52,
\&        },
\&
\&       (See the "Writing Modules with Inline" section of Inline.pod for
\&        an explanation/elaboration.)
\&
\&    6) Change your \*(Aquse Inline C => DATA\*(Aq to \*(Aquse Inline C => DATA => NAME
\&       => Foo => VERSION => 1.23\*(Aq
\&    7) Make sure NAME matches your package name (\*(AqFoo\*(Aq), or begins with
\&       \*(AqFoo::\*(Aq.
\&    8) If you want to quiet a harmless warning that will appear when the
\&       module is loaded via "require", do "Inline\->init();".
\&       See "Writing Modules with Inline" in the Inline pod for details.
\&    9) Make sure VERSION matches $Foo::VERSION. This must be a string (not a
\&       number) matching /^\ed\e.\ed\ed$/
\&    10) Do the perl/make/test/install dance (thanks binkley :)
.Ve
.PP
With Inline 0.41 (or thereabouts) you can skip steps 3 & 4, and just
say 'perl \-MInline=INSTALL ./Foo.pm'. This will work for non-Inline
modules too. It will become the defacto standard (since there is no easy
standard) way of installing a Perl module. It will allow Makefile.PL
parameters 'perl \-MInline=INSTALL ./Foo.pm \- PREFIX=/home/ingy/perl' and
things like that. It will also make use of a \s-1MANIFEST\s0 if you provide
one.
.SS "How do I create a binary distribution using Inline?"
.IX Subsection "How do I create a binary distribution using Inline?"
I've figured out how to create and install a \s-1PPM\s0 binary distribution;
with or without distributing the C code! And I've decided to share it
with all of you :)
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 Future versions of Inline will make this process a one line
command. But for now just use this simple recipe.
.PP
\&\-\-\-
.PP
The Inline 0.40 distribution comes with a sample extension module called
Math::Simple. Theoretically you could distribute this module on \s-1CPAN.\s0 It
has all the necessary support for installation. You can find it in
Inline\-0.40/modules/Math/Simple/. Here are the steps for converting this
into a binary distribution *without* C source code.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 The recipient of this binary distribution will need to have the
\&\s-1PPM\s0.pm module installed. This module requires a lot of other \s-1CPAN\s0
modules. ActivePerl (available for Win32, Linux, and Solaris) has all of
these bundled. While ActivePerl isn't required, it makes things (a
lot) easier.
.PP
1) cd Inline\-0.40/Math/Simple/
.PP
2) Divide Simple.pm into two files:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    \-\-\-8<\-\-\- (Simple.pm)
\&    package Math::Simple;
\&    use strict;
\&    require Exporter;
\&    @Math::Simple::ISA = qw(Exporter);
\&    @Math::Simple::EXPORT = qw(add subtract);
\&    $Math::Simple::VERSION = \*(Aq1.23\*(Aq;
\&
\&    use Inline (C => \*(Aqsrc/Simple.c\*(Aq =>
\&                NAME => \*(AqMath::Simple\*(Aq,
\&                VERSION => \*(Aq1.23\*(Aq,
\&               );
\&    1;
\&    \-\-\-8<\-\-\-
\&    \-\-\-8<\-\-\- (src/Simple.c)
\&    int add (int x, int y) {
\&        return x + y;
\&    }
\&
\&    int subtract (int x, int y) {
\&        return x \- y;
\&    }
\&    \-\-\-8<\-\-\-
.Ve
.PP
So now you have the Perl in one file and the C in the other. The C code
must be in a subdirectory.
.PP
3)
Note that I also changed the term '\s-1DATA\s0' to the name of the C file. This
will work just as if the C were still inline.
.PP
4) Run 'perl Makefile.PL'
.PP
5) Run 'make test'
.PP
6) Get the \s-1MD5\s0 key from 'blib/arch/auto/Math/Simple/Simple.inl'
.PP
7)
Edit 'blib/lib/Math/Simple.pm'. Change 'src/Simple.c' to
\&'02c61710cab5b659efc343a9a830aa73' (the \s-1MD5\s0 key)
.PP
8) Run 'make ppd'
.PP
9)
Edit 'Math\-Simple.ppd'. Fill in \s-1AUTHOR\s0 and \s-1ABSTRACT\s0 if you wish. Then
change:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    <CODEBASE HREF="" />
.Ve
.PP
to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    <CODEBASE HREF="Math\-Simple.tar.gz" />
.Ve
.PP
10) Run:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    tar cvf Math\-Simple.tar blib
\&    gzip \-\-best Math\-Simple.tar
.Ve
.PP
11)
Run:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    tar cvf Math\-Simple\-1.23.tar Math\-Simple.ppd Math\-Simple.tar.gz
\&    gzip \-\-best Math\-Simple\-1.23.tar
.Ve
.PP
12) Distribute Math\-Simple\-1.23.tar.gz with the following instructions:
.PP
A) Run:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    gzip \-d Math\-Simple\-1.23.tar.gz
\&    tar xvzf Math\-Simple\-1.23.tar
.Ve
.PP
B) Run 'ppm install Math\-Simple.ppd'
.PP
C) Delete Math\-Simple.tar and Math\-Simple.ppd.
.PP
D) Test with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-MMath::Simple \-le \*(Aqprint add(37, 42)\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
\&\-\-\-
.PP
That's it. The process should also work with zip instead of tar, but I
haven't tried it.
.PP
The recipient of the binary must have Perl built with a matching
architecture. Luckily, ppm will catch this.
.PP
For a binary dist *with* C source code, simply omit steps 2, 3, 6, and
7.
.PP
If this seems too hard, then in a future version you should be able to
just type:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    make ppm
.Ve
.SS "Why does C/t/09parser.t fail on Cygwin ?"
.IX Subsection "Why does C/t/09parser.t fail on Cygwin ?"
It doesn't always fail on Cygwin, but if you find that it produces
\&\*(L"unable to remap .... to same address as parent\*(R" errors during the
build phase, then it's time for you to run rebaseall.
.PP

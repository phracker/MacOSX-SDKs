\fIcommandBuffer\fP The command buffer\&. 
.br
\fIsourceGradients\fP An MPSImageBatch containing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the results of batch normalization on the source images\&.

\fIsourceImages\fP An MPSImageBatch containing the source images for batch normalization\&. 
.br
\fIbatchNormalizationState\fP \fBA\fP valid \fBMPSCNNBatchNormalizationState\fP object which has been previously updated using a \fBMPSCNNBatchNormalizationStatistics\fP kernel and the source images\&. Upon completion of the command buffer, will contain the (possibly partially updated) gradients for the loss function with respect to the scale and bias parameters used to compute the batch normalization\&. The state will be considered to be completely updated when all MPSImages in the training batch have been processed\&.

Encode a gradient filter and return a gradient  During training, gradient filters are used to calculate the gradient associated with the loss for each feature channel in the forward pass source image\&. For those nodes that are trainable, these are then used to refine the value used in the trainable parameter\&. They consume a source gradient image which contains the gradients corresponding with the forward pass destination image, and calculate the gradients corresponding to the forward pass source image\&.
.PP
\fBA\fP gradient filter consumes a \fBMPSNNGradientState\fP object which captured various forward pass properties such as offset and edgeMode at the time the forward pass was encoded\&. These are transferred to the \fBMPSCNNBinaryKernel\fP secondary image properties automatically when this method creates its destination image\&.

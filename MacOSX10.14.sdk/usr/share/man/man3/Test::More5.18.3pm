.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fB\s-1STOP\s0!\fR If you're just getting started writing tests, have a look at
Test::Simple first.  This is a drop in replacement for Test::Simple
which you can switch to once you get the hang of basic testing.
.PP
The purpose of this module is to provide a wide range of testing
utilities.  Various ways to say \*(L"ok\*(R" with better diagnostics,
facilities to skip tests, test future features and compare complicated
data structures.  While you can do almost anything with a simple
\&\f(CW\*(C`ok()\*(C'\fR function, it doesn't provide good diagnostic output.
.SS "I love it when a plan comes together"
.IX Subsection "I love it when a plan comes together"
Before anything else, you need a testing plan.  This basically declares
how many tests your script is going to run to protect against premature
failure.
.PP
The preferred way to do this is to declare a plan when you \f(CW\*(C`use Test::More\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Test::More tests => 23;
.Ve
.PP
There are cases when you will not know beforehand how many tests your
script is going to run.  In this case, you can declare your tests at
the end.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Test::More;
\&
\&  ... run your tests ...
\&
\&  done_testing( $number_of_tests_run );
.Ve
.PP
Sometimes you really don't know how many tests were run, or it's too
difficult to calculate.  In which case you can leave off
\&\f(CW$number_of_tests_run\fR.
.PP
In some cases, you'll want to completely skip an entire testing script.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Test::More skip_all => $skip_reason;
.Ve
.PP
Your script will declare a skip with the reason why you skipped and
exit immediately with a zero (success).  See Test::Harness for
details.
.PP
If you want to control what functions Test::More will export, you
have to use the 'import' option.  For example, to import everything
but 'fail', you'd do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Test::More tests => 23, import => [\*(Aq!fail\*(Aq];
.Ve
.PP
Alternatively, you can use the \fIplan()\fR function.  Useful for when you
have to calculate the number of tests.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use Test::More;
\&  plan tests => keys %Stuff * 3;
.Ve
.PP
or for deciding between running the tests at all:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  use Test::More;
\&  if( $^O eq \*(AqMacOS\*(Aq ) {
\&      plan skip_all => \*(AqTest irrelevant on MacOS\*(Aq;
\&  }
\&  else {
\&      plan tests => 42;
\&  }
.Ve
.IP "\fBdone_testing\fR" 4
.IX Item "done_testing"
.Vb 2
\&    done_testing();
\&    done_testing($number_of_tests);
.Ve
.Sp
If you don't know how many tests you're going to run, you can issue
the plan when you're done running tests.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$number_of_tests\fR is the same as \fIplan()\fR, it's the number of tests you
expected to run.  You can omit this, in which case the number of tests
you ran doesn't matter, just the fact that your tests ran to
conclusion.
.Sp
This is safer than and replaces the \*(L"no_plan\*(R" plan.
.SS "Test names"
.IX Subsection "Test names"
By convention, each test is assigned a number in order.  This is
largely done automatically for you.  However, it's often very useful to
assign a name to each test.  Which would you rather see:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  ok 4
\&  not ok 5
\&  ok 6
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  ok 4 \- basic multi\-variable
\&  not ok 5 \- simple exponential
\&  ok 6 \- force == mass * acceleration
.Ve
.PP
The later gives you some idea of what failed.  It also makes it easier
to find the test in your script, simply search for \*(L"simple
exponential\*(R".
.PP
All test functions take a name argument.  It's optional, but highly
suggested that you use it.
.SS "I'm ok, you're not ok."
.IX Subsection "I'm ok, you're not ok."
The basic purpose of this module is to print out either \*(L"ok #\*(R" or \*(L"not
ok #\*(R" depending on if a given test succeeded or failed.  Everything
else is just gravy.
.PP
All of the following print \*(L"ok\*(R" or \*(L"not ok\*(R" depending on if the test
succeeded or failed.  They all also return true or false,
respectively.
.IP "\fBok\fR" 4
.IX Item "ok"
.Vb 1
\&  ok($got eq $expected, $test_name);
.Ve
.Sp
This simply evaluates any expression (\f(CW\*(C`$got eq $expected\*(C'\fR is just a
simple example) and uses that to determine if the test succeeded or
failed.  A true expression passes, a false one fails.  Very simple.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    ok( $exp{9} == 81,                   \*(Aqsimple exponential\*(Aq );
\&    ok( Film\->can(\*(Aqdb_Main\*(Aq),            \*(Aqset_db()\*(Aq );
\&    ok( $p\->tests == 4,                  \*(Aqsaw tests\*(Aq );
\&    ok( !grep !defined $_, @items,       \*(Aqitems populated\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
(Mnemonic:  \*(L"This is ok.\*(R")
.Sp
\&\f(CW$test_name\fR is a very short description of the test that will be printed
out.  It makes it very easy to find a test in your script when it fails
and gives others an idea of your intentions.  \f(CW$test_name\fR is optional,
but we \fBvery\fR strongly encourage its use.
.Sp
Should an \fIok()\fR fail, it will produce some diagnostics:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    not ok 18 \- sufficient mucus
\&    #   Failed test \*(Aqsufficient mucus\*(Aq
\&    #   in foo.t at line 42.
.Ve
.Sp
This is the same as Test::Simple's \fIok()\fR routine.
.IP "\fBis\fR" 4
.IX Item "is"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBisnt\fR" 4
.IX Item "isnt"
.PD
.Vb 2
\&  is  ( $got, $expected, $test_name );
\&  isnt( $got, $expected, $test_name );
.Ve
.Sp
Similar to \fIok()\fR, \fIis()\fR and \fIisnt()\fR compare their two arguments
with \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ne\*(C'\fR respectively and use the result of that to
determine if the test succeeded or failed.  So these:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # Is the ultimate answer 42?
\&    is( ultimate_answer(), 42,          "Meaning of Life" );
\&
\&    # $foo isn\*(Aqt empty
\&    isnt( $foo, \*(Aq\*(Aq,     "Got some foo" );
.Ve
.Sp
are similar to these:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    ok( ultimate_answer() eq 42,        "Meaning of Life" );
\&    ok( $foo ne \*(Aq\*(Aq,     "Got some foo" );
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR will only ever match \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.  So you can test a value
agains \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    is($not_defined, undef, "undefined as expected");
.Ve
.Sp
(Mnemonic:  \*(L"This is that.\*(R"  \*(L"This isn't that.\*(R")
.Sp
So why use these?  They produce better diagnostics on failure.  \fIok()\fR
cannot know what you are testing for (beyond the name), but \fIis()\fR and
\&\fIisnt()\fR know what the test was and why it failed.  For example this
test:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $foo = \*(Aqwaffle\*(Aq;  my $bar = \*(Aqyarblokos\*(Aq;
\&    is( $foo, $bar,   \*(AqIs foo the same as bar?\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
Will produce something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    not ok 17 \- Is foo the same as bar?
\&    #   Failed test \*(AqIs foo the same as bar?\*(Aq
\&    #   in foo.t at line 139.
\&    #          got: \*(Aqwaffle\*(Aq
\&    #     expected: \*(Aqyarblokos\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
So you can figure out what went wrong without rerunning the test.
.Sp
You are encouraged to use \fIis()\fR and \fIisnt()\fR over \fIok()\fR where possible,
however do not be tempted to use them to find out if something is
true or false!
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  # XXX BAD!
\&  is( exists $brooklyn{tree}, 1, \*(AqA tree grows in Brooklyn\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
This does not check if \f(CW\*(C`exists $brooklyn{tree}\*(C'\fR is true, it checks if
it returns 1.  Very different.  Similar caveats exist for false and 0.
In these cases, use \fIok()\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  ok( exists $brooklyn{tree},    \*(AqA tree grows in Brooklyn\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
A simple call to \fIisnt()\fR usually does not provide a strong test but there
are cases when you cannot say much more about a value than that it is
different from some other value:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  new_ok $obj, "Foo";
\&
\&  my $clone = $obj\->clone;
\&  isa_ok $obj, "Foo", "Foo\->clone";
\&
\&  isnt $obj, $clone, "clone() produces a different object";
.Ve
.Sp
For those grammatical pedants out there, there's an \f(CW\*(C`isn\*(Aqt()\*(C'\fR
function which is an alias of \fIisnt()\fR.
.IP "\fBlike\fR" 4
.IX Item "like"
.Vb 1
\&  like( $got, qr/expected/, $test_name );
.Ve
.Sp
Similar to \fIok()\fR, \fIlike()\fR matches \f(CW$got\fR against the regex \f(CW\*(C`qr/expected/\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
So this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    like($got, qr/expected/, \*(Aqthis is like that\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
is similar to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ok( $got =~ /expected/, \*(Aqthis is like that\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
(Mnemonic \*(L"This is like that\*(R".)
.Sp
The second argument is a regular expression.  It may be given as a
regex reference (i.e. \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR) or (for better compatibility with older
perls) as a string that looks like a regex (alternative delimiters are
currently not supported):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    like( $got, \*(Aq/expected/\*(Aq, \*(Aqthis is like that\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
Regex options may be placed on the end (\f(CW\*(Aq/expected/i\*(Aq\fR).
.Sp
Its advantages over \fIok()\fR are similar to that of \fIis()\fR and \fIisnt()\fR.  Better
diagnostics on failure.
.IP "\fBunlike\fR" 4
.IX Item "unlike"
.Vb 1
\&  unlike( $got, qr/expected/, $test_name );
.Ve
.Sp
Works exactly as \fIlike()\fR, only it checks if \f(CW$got\fR \fBdoes not\fR match the
given pattern.
.IP "\fBcmp_ok\fR" 4
.IX Item "cmp_ok"
.Vb 1
\&  cmp_ok( $got, $op, $expected, $test_name );
.Ve
.Sp
Halfway between \fIok()\fR and \fIis()\fR lies \fIcmp_ok()\fR.  This allows you to
compare two arguments using any binary perl operator.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # ok( $got eq $expected );
\&    cmp_ok( $got, \*(Aqeq\*(Aq, $expected, \*(Aqthis eq that\*(Aq );
\&
\&    # ok( $got == $expected );
\&    cmp_ok( $got, \*(Aq==\*(Aq, $expected, \*(Aqthis == that\*(Aq );
\&
\&    # ok( $got && $expected );
\&    cmp_ok( $got, \*(Aq&&\*(Aq, $expected, \*(Aqthis && that\*(Aq );
\&    ...etc...
.Ve
.Sp
Its advantage over \fIok()\fR is when the test fails you'll know what \f(CW$got\fR
and \f(CW$expected\fR were:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    not ok 1
\&    #   Failed test in foo.t at line 12.
\&    #     \*(Aq23\*(Aq
\&    #         &&
\&    #     undef
.Ve
.Sp
It's also useful in those cases where you are comparing numbers and
\&\fIis()\fR's use of \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR will interfere:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    cmp_ok( $big_hairy_number, \*(Aq==\*(Aq, $another_big_hairy_number );
.Ve
.Sp
It's especially useful when comparing greater-than or smaller-than 
relation between values:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    cmp_ok( $some_value, \*(Aq<=\*(Aq, $upper_limit );
.Ve
.IP "\fBcan_ok\fR" 4
.IX Item "can_ok"
.Vb 2
\&  can_ok($module, @methods);
\&  can_ok($object, @methods);
.Ve
.Sp
Checks to make sure the \f(CW$module\fR or \f(CW$object\fR can do these \f(CW@methods\fR
(works with functions, too).
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    can_ok(\*(AqFoo\*(Aq, qw(this that whatever));
.Ve
.Sp
is almost exactly like saying:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    ok( Foo\->can(\*(Aqthis\*(Aq) && 
\&        Foo\->can(\*(Aqthat\*(Aq) && 
\&        Foo\->can(\*(Aqwhatever\*(Aq) 
\&      );
.Ve
.Sp
only without all the typing and with a better interface.  Handy for
quickly testing an interface.
.Sp
No matter how many \f(CW@methods\fR you check, a single \fIcan_ok()\fR call counts
as one test.  If you desire otherwise, use:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    foreach my $meth (@methods) {
\&        can_ok(\*(AqFoo\*(Aq, $meth);
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "\fBisa_ok\fR" 4
.IX Item "isa_ok"
.Vb 3
\&  isa_ok($object,   $class, $object_name);
\&  isa_ok($subclass, $class, $object_name);
\&  isa_ok($ref,      $type,  $ref_name);
.Ve
.Sp
Checks to see if the given \f(CW\*(C`$object\->isa($class)\*(C'\fR.  Also checks to make
sure the object was defined in the first place.  Handy for this sort
of thing:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $obj = Some::Module\->new;
\&    isa_ok( $obj, \*(AqSome::Module\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
where you'd otherwise have to write
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $obj = Some::Module\->new;
\&    ok( defined $obj && $obj\->isa(\*(AqSome::Module\*(Aq) );
.Ve
.Sp
to safeguard against your test script blowing up.
.Sp
You can also test a class, to make sure that it has the right ancestor:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    isa_ok( \*(AqVole\*(Aq, \*(AqRodent\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
It works on references, too:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    isa_ok( $array_ref, \*(AqARRAY\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
The diagnostics of this test normally just refer to 'the object'.  If
you'd like them to be more specific, you can supply an \f(CW$object_name\fR
(for example 'Test customer').
.IP "\fBnew_ok\fR" 4
.IX Item "new_ok"
.Vb 3
\&  my $obj = new_ok( $class );
\&  my $obj = new_ok( $class => \e@args );
\&  my $obj = new_ok( $class => \e@args, $object_name );
.Ve
.Sp
A convenience function which combines creating an object and calling
\&\fIisa_ok()\fR on that object.
.Sp
It is basically equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $obj = $class\->new(@args);
\&    isa_ok $obj, $class, $object_name;
.Ve
.Sp
If \f(CW@args\fR is not given, an empty list will be used.
.Sp

.Vb 1
\&    subtest $name => \e&code;
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fIsubtest()\fR runs the &code as its own little test with its own plan and
its own result.  The main test counts this as a single test using the
result of the whole subtest to determine if its ok or not ok.
.Sp
For example...
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  use Test::More tests => 3;
\& 
\&  pass("First test");
\&
\&  subtest \*(AqAn example subtest\*(Aq => sub {
\&      plan tests => 2;
\&
\&      pass("This is a subtest");
\&      pass("So is this");

\&
\&  pass("Third test");
.Ve
.Sp
This would produce.

.Vb 7

\&      ok 1 \- This is a subtest
\&      ok 2 \- So is this
\&  ok 2 \- An example subtest
\&  ok 3 \- Third test
.Ve
.Sp
A subtest may call \*(L"skip_all\*(R".  No tests will be run, but the subtest is
considered a skip.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  subtest \*(Aqskippy\*(Aq => sub {
\&      plan skip_all => \*(Aqcuz I said so\*(Aq;
\&      pass(\*(Aqthis test will never be run\*(Aq);
\&  };
.Ve
.Sp
Returns true if the subtest passed, false otherwise.
.Sp
Due to how subtests work, you may omit a plan if you desire.  This adds an
implicit \f(CW\*(C`done_testing()\*(C'\fR to the end of your subtest.  The following two
subtests are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  subtest \*(Aqsubtest with implicit done_testing()\*(Aq, sub {

.Ve
.Sp
Sometimes you just want to say that the tests have passed.  Usually
the case is you've got some complicated condition that is difficult to
wedge into an \fIok()\fR.  In this case, you can simply use \fIpass()\fR (to
declare the test ok) or fail (for not ok).  They are synonyms for
\&\fIok\fR\|(1) and \fIok\fR\|(0).
.Sp
Use these very, very, very sparingly.
.SS "Module tests"
.IX Subsection "Module tests"
You usually want to test if the module you're testing loads ok, rather
than just vomiting if its load fails.  For such purposes we have
\&\f(CW\*(C`use_ok\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`require_ok\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBuse_ok\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_ok"
.Vb 2
\&   BEGIN { use_ok($module); }
\&   BEGIN { use_ok($module, @imports); }
.Ve
.Sp
These simply use the given \f(CW$module\fR and test to make sure the load
happened ok.  It's recommended that you run \fIuse_ok()\fR inside a \s-1BEGIN\s0
block so its functions are exported at compile-time and prototypes are
properly honored.
.Sp
If \f(CW@imports\fR are given, they are passed through to the use.  So this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   BEGIN { use_ok(\*(AqSome::Module\*(Aq, qw(foo bar)) }
.Ve
.Sp
is like doing this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   use Some::Module qw(foo bar);
.Ve
.Sp
Version numbers can be checked like so:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   # Just like "use Some::Module 1.02"
\&   BEGIN { use_ok(\*(AqSome::Module\*(Aq, 1.02) }
.Ve
.Sp
Don't try to do this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   BEGIN {
\&       use_ok(\*(AqSome::Module\*(Aq);
\&
\&       ...some code that depends on the use...
\&       ...happening at compile time...
\&   }
.Ve
.Sp
because the notion of \*(L"compile-time\*(R" is relative.  Instead, you want:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  BEGIN { use_ok(\*(AqSome::Module\*(Aq) }
\&  BEGIN { ...some code that depends on the use... }
.Ve
.Sp
If you want the equivalent of \f(CW\*(C`use Foo ()\*(C'\fR, use a module but not
import anything, use \f(CW\*(C`require_ok\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  BEGIN { require_ok "Foo" }
.Ve
.IP "\fBrequire_ok\fR" 4
.IX Item "require_ok"
.Vb 2
\&   require_ok($module);

.SS "Complex data structures"
.IX Subsection "Complex data structures"
Not everything is a simple eq check or regex.  There are times you
need to see if two data structures are equivalent.  For these
instances Test::More provides a handful of useful functions.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR I'm not quite sure what will happen with filehandles.
.IP "\fBis_deeply\fR" 4
.IX Item "is_deeply"
.Vb 1
\&  is_deeply( $got, $expected, $test_name );
.Ve
.Sp
Similar to \fIis()\fR, except that if \f(CW$got\fR and \f(CW$expected\fR are references, it
does a deep comparison walking each data structure to see if they are
equivalent.  If the two structures are different, it will display the
place where they start differing.
.Sp
\&\fIis_deeply()\fR compares the dereferenced values of references, the
references themselves (except for their type) are ignored.  This means
aspects such as blessing and ties are not considered \*(L"different\*(R".
.Sp
\&\fIis_deeply()\fR currently has very limited handling of function reference
and globs.  It merely checks if they have the same referent.  This may
improve in the future.
.Sp
Test::Differences and Test::Deep provide more in-depth functionality
along these lines.
.SS "Diagnostics"
.IX Subsection "Diagnostics"
If you pick the right test function, you'll usually get a good idea of
what went wrong when it failed.  But sometimes it doesn't work out
that way.  So here we have ways for you to write your own diagnostic
messages which are safer than just \f(CW\*(C`print STDERR\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBdiag\fR" 4
.IX Item "diag"
.Vb 1
\&  diag(@diagnostic_message);
.Ve
.Sp
Prints a diagnostic message which is guaranteed not to interfere with
test output.  Like \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR \f(CW@diagnostic_message\fR is simply concatenated
together.
.Sp
Returns false, so as to preserve failure.
.Sp
Handy for this sort of thing:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    ok( grep(/foo/, @users), "There\*(Aqs a foo user" ) or
\&        diag("Since there\*(Aqs no foo, check that /etc/bar is set up right");
.Ve
.Sp
which would produce:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    not ok 42 \- There\*(Aqs a foo user
\&    #   Failed test \*(AqThere\*(Aqs a foo user\*(Aq
\&    #   in foo.t at line 52.
\&    # Since there\*(Aqs no foo, check that /etc/bar is set up right.
.Ve
.Sp
You might remember \f(CW\*(C`ok() or diag()\*(C'\fR with the mnemonic \f(CW\*(C`open() or
die()\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR The exact formatting of the diagnostic output is still
changing, but it is guaranteed that whatever you throw at it it won't
interfere with the test.
.IP "\fBnote\fR" 4
.IX Item "note"
.Vb 1
\&  note(@diagnostic_message);
.Ve
.Sp
Like \fIdiag()\fR, except the message will not be seen when the test is run
in a harness.  It will only be visible in the verbose \s-1TAP\s0 stream.
.Sp
Handy for putting in notes which might be useful for debugging, but
don't indicate a problem.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    note("Tempfile is $tempfile");
.Ve
.IP "\fBexplain\fR" 4
.IX Item "explain"
.Vb 1
\&  my @dump = explain @diagnostic_message;

.Sp
Will dump the contents of any references in a human readable format.
Usually you want to pass this into \f(CW\*(C`note\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`diag\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Handy for things like...
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    is_deeply($have, $want) || diag explain $have;

.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    note explain \e%args;
\&    Some::Class\->method(%args);
.Ve
.SS "Conditional tests"
.IX Subsection "Conditional tests"
Sometimes running a test under certain conditions will cause the
test script to die.  A certain function or method isn't implemented
(such as \fIfork()\fR on MacOS), some resource isn't available (like a 
net connection) or a module isn't available.  In these cases it's
necessary to skip tests, or declare that they are supposed to fail
but will work in the future (a todo test).
.PP
For more details on the mechanics of skip and todo tests see
Test::Harness.
.PP
The way Test::More handles this is with a named block.  Basically, a
block of tests which can be skipped over or made todo.  It's best if I
just show you...
.IP "\fB\s-1SKIP: BLOCK\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SKIP: BLOCK"
.Vb 2
\&  SKIP: {
\&      skip $why, $how_many if $condition;
\&
\&      ...normal testing code goes here...
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
This declares a block of tests that might be skipped, \f(CW$how_many\fR tests
there are, \f(CW$why\fR and under what \f(CW$condition\fR to skip them.  An example is
the easiest way to illustrate:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    SKIP: {
\&        eval { require HTML::Lint };
\&
\&        skip "HTML::Lint not installed", 2 if $@;
\&
\&        my $lint = new HTML::Lint;
\&        isa_ok( $lint, "HTML::Lint" );
\&
\&        $lint\->parse( $html );
\&        is( $lint\->errors, 0, "No errors found in HTML" );
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
If the user does not have HTML::Lint installed, the whole block of
code \fIwon't be run at all\fR.  Test::More will output special ok's
which Test::Harness interprets as skipped, but passing, tests.
.Sp
It's important that \f(CW$how_many\fR accurately reflects the number of tests
in the \s-1SKIP\s0 block so the # of tests run will match up with your plan.
If your plan is \f(CW\*(C`no_plan\*(C'\fR \f(CW$how_many\fR is optional and will default to 1.
.Sp
It's perfectly safe to nest \s-1SKIP\s0 blocks.  Each \s-1SKIP\s0 block must have
the label \f(CW\*(C`SKIP\*(C'\fR, or Test::More can't work its magic.
.Sp
You don't skip tests which are failing because there's a bug in your
program, or for which you don't yet have code written.  For that you
use \s-1TODO. \s0 Read on.
.IP "\fB\s-1TODO: BLOCK\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "TODO: BLOCK"
.Vb 2
\&    TODO: {
\&        local $TODO = $why if $condition;
\&
\&        ...normal testing code goes here...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Declares a block of tests you expect to fail and \f(CW$why\fR.  Perhaps it's
because you haven't fixed a bug or haven't finished a new feature:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TODO: {
\&        local $TODO = "URI::Geller not finished";
\&
\&        my $card = "Eight of clubs";
\&        is( URI::Geller\->your_card, $card, \*(AqIs THIS your card?\*(Aq );
\&
\&        my $spoon;
\&        URI::Geller\->bend_spoon;
\&        is( $spoon, \*(Aqbent\*(Aq,    "Spoon bending, that\*(Aqs original" );
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
With a todo block, the tests inside are expected to fail.  Test::More
will run the tests normally, but print out special flags indicating
they are \*(L"todo\*(R".  Test::Harness will interpret failures as being ok.
Should anything succeed, it will report it as an unexpected success.
You then know the thing you had todo is done and can remove the
\&\s-1TODO\s0 flag.
.Sp
The nice part about todo tests, as opposed to simply commenting out a
block of tests, is it's like having a programmatic todo list.  You know
how much work is left to be done, you're aware of what bugs there are,
and you'll know immediately when they're fixed.
.Sp
Once a todo test starts succeeding, simply move it outside the block.
When the block is empty, delete it.
.IP "\fBtodo_skip\fR" 4
.IX Item "todo_skip"
.Vb 2
\&    TODO: {
\&        todo_skip $why, $how_many if $condition;
\&
\&        ...normal testing code...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
With todo tests, it's best to have the tests actually run.  That way
you'll know when they start passing.  Sometimes this isn't possible.
Often a failing test will cause the whole program to die or hang, even
inside an \f(CW\*(C`eval BLOCK\*(C'\fR with and using \f(CW\*(C`alarm\*(C'\fR.  In these extreme
cases you have no choice but to skip over the broken tests entirely.
.Sp
The syntax and behavior is similar to a \f(CW\*(C`SKIP: BLOCK\*(C'\fR except the
tests will be marked as failing but todo.  Test::Harness will
interpret them as passing.
.IP "When do I use \s-1SKIP\s0 vs. \s-1TODO\s0?" 4
.IX Item "When do I use SKIP vs. TODO?"
\&\fBIf it's something the user might not be able to do\fR, use \s-1SKIP.\s0
This includes optional modules that aren't installed, running under
an \s-1OS\s0 that doesn't have some feature (like \fIfork()\fR or symlinks), or maybe
you need an Internet connection and one isn't available.
.Sp
\&\fBIf it's something the programmer hasn't done yet\fR, use \s-1TODO. \s0 This

.Sp
This is typically used when testing cannot continue such as a critical
module failing to compile or a necessary external utility not being
available such as a database connection failing.

For even better control look at Test::Most.
.SS "Discouraged comparison functions"
.IX Subsection "Discouraged comparison functions"
The use of the following functions is discouraged as they are not
actually testing functions and produce no diagnostics to help figure
out what went wrong.  They were written before \fIis_deeply()\fR existed
because I couldn't figure out how to display a useful diff of two
arbitrary data structures.
.PP
These functions are usually used inside an \fIok()\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1

\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR By historical accident, this is not a true set comparison.
While the order of elements does not matter, duplicate elements do.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR \fIeq_set()\fR does not know how to deal with references at the top
level.  The following is an example of a comparison which might not work:
.Sp

.Ve
.Sp
Test::Deep contains much better set comparison functions.
.SS "Extending and Embedding Test::More"
.IX Subsection "Extending and Embedding Test::More"
Sometimes the Test::More interface isn't quite enough.  Fortunately,
Test::More is built on top of Test::Builder which provides a single,
unified backend for any test library to use.  This means two test
libraries which both use Test::Builder \fBcan be used together in the
same program\fR.
.PP
If you simply want to do a little tweaking of how the tests behave,
you can access the underlying Test::Builder object like so:
.IP "\fBbuilder\fR" 4
.IX Item "builder"
.Vb 1
\&    my $test_builder = Test::More\->builder;
.Ve
.Sp
Returns the Test::Builder object underlying Test::More for you to play
with.
.SH "EXIT CODES"
.IX Header "EXIT CODES"
If all your tests passed, Test::Builder will exit with zero (which is
normal).  If anything failed it will exit with how many failed.  If
you run less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras)
will be considered failures.  If no tests were ever run Test::Builder
will throw a warning and exit with 255.  If the test died, even after
having successfully completed all its tests, it will still be
considered a failure and will exit with 255.
.PP
So the exit codes are...
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    0                   all tests successful

If you use utf8 or other non-ASCII characters with Test::More you
might get a \*(L"Wide character in print\*(R" warning.  Using \f(CW\*(C`binmode

.IP "Overloaded objects" 4
.IX Item "Overloaded objects"
String overloaded objects are compared \fBas strings\fR (or in \fIcmp_ok()\fR's
case, strings or numbers as appropriate to the comparison op).  This
prevents Test::More from piercing an object's interface allowing
better blackbox testing.  So if a function starts returning overloaded
objects instead of bare strings your tests won't notice the
difference.  This is good.
.Sp
However, it does mean that functions like \fIis_deeply()\fR cannot be used to
test the internals of string overloaded objects.  In this case I would
suggest Test::Deep which contains more flexible testing functions for
complex data structures.
.IP "Threads" 4
.IX Item "Threads"
Test::More will only be aware of threads if \*(L"use threads\*(R" has been done
\&\fIbefore\fR Test::More is loaded.  This is ok:

This is a case of convergent evolution with Joshua Pritikin's Test

with a few other problems).
.PP
The goal here is to have a testing utility that's simple to learn,
quick to use and difficult to trip yourself up with while still
providing more flexibility than the existing Test.pm.  As such, the

magic side-effects are kept to a minimum.  \s-1WYSIWYG.\s0

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
This describes the changes made to modules in the Locale-Codes
distribution.  Major changes are marked with asterisks (*).  For the
most part, all modules have remained backward compatible at every
release, but occasionally a change is made which is backward
incompatible. These are marked with an exclamation mark (!).
.PP
As of 3.00, the codes are autogenerated from the standards. With each
release, codes will be re-generated and tested to see if any code
changed. Any time there are any changes to the codes, it will be
flagged below with a change: \s-1NEW CODE\s0(s).
.PP
I intend to check for new codes four times a year (March, June,
September, December). I will also check on request, so if a code
changes that you use, feel free to contact me.  Any time there are new
codes, I will add them to the module and release a new version.

.IP "\fB\s-1FIPS\-10\s0 country codes deprecated\fR" 4
.IX Item "FIPS-10 country codes deprecated"
The \s-1FIPS\-10\s0 document is being withdrawn.  It was deprecated in 2008,
and is being updated now only until all the agencies that use it have
switched to something else.  The current version no longer lists the
long names for countries.  These long names (such as 'Republic of
Albania' for Albania) only appeared in the old \s-1FIPS\-10\s0 document which
is no longer available, so they are no longer available in this module.
.Sp
I will continue to support the \s-1FIPS\-10\s0 codeset as long as it is available,
but at that point, it will be withdrawn immediately.  If an official
end-of-life date is announced, I will include a notice here.  Otherwise, support
for the codeset will be discontinued when the document is withdrawn.
.Sp
You are encouraged to no longer use the \s-1FIPS\-10\s0 codeset.
.IP "\fBDomain country codes now come from \s-1ISO 3166\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "Domain country codes now come from ISO 3166"
The \s-1IANA\s0 domain codes have changed slightly.  The \s-1IANA\s0 no longer
publishes a list of countries associated with their codes.  Instead,
they use the \s-1ISO 3166\s0 codes and country names.  However, they support
a few non-standard codes, so I will continue to maintain this codeset.
The domain codes are now lowercase to correspond to the \s-1ISO 3166\s0 codes.

Reorganized modules to move Locale::MODULE to Locale::Codes::MODULE to
allow for cleaner future additions.  The original four modules (Locale::Language,

.IX Item "Reorganized code"
Moved support files into the Locale::Codes namespace.
.Sp
The work done in each of the Locale::XXX modules was virtually
identical to each other. It has all been moved to a central module and
the Locale::XXX modules are now just wrappers.
.IP "\fB(!) Changed XXX_code2code behavior slightly\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) Changed XXX_code2code behavior slightly"
In previous versions, passing in the same code set for both code set
arguments would automatically return undef. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   country_code2code(\*(Aqbo\*(Aq,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
\&      => undef
.Ve
.Sp
This doesn't seem like reasonable behavior, so it has been changed
to allow the same code set:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   country_code2code(\*(Aqbo\*(Aq,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
\&      => \*(Aqbo\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
Note that if an invalid code is passed in, undef will still be
returned:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   country_code2code(\*(Aqbol\*(Aq,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
\&      => undef
.Ve
.IP "\fBAdded many semi-private routines\fR" 4
.IX Item "Added many semi-private routines"
Previous versions had only two semi-private routines: rename_country
and alias_code which had the ability to modify the internal data in
a couple very limited ways. It was requested (in an anonymous posting
by someone named Steve and also by Steve Hay) that better support
for modifying internal data, so a full set of routines were added.
.Sp
The full set of routines includes:
.Sp

.IP "\fBNew maintainer\fR" 4
.IX Item "New maintainer"
From 1997 to 2004, Locale::Codes was maintained by Neil
Bowers. Unfortunately, no updates were made from June 2004 to January
2010. During that time, a number of changes have been made to the
standards since then, so the data included was out-of-date.
.Sp
I contacted Neil to get his permission to assume maintenance of
the module, and he kindly agreed.
.IP "\fB(*) (!) All codes are generated from standards\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) (!) All codes are generated from standards"
All of the values returned by the various functions are now values
directly from the standards. This means that the values returned in
the 2.xx series are not necessarily the same as the values returned
here.
.Sp
As an example, the \s-1ISO 3166\s0 standard which lists country codes refers
to the country associated with the code \*(L"bo\*(R" as \*(L"Bolivia,
Plurinational State of\*(R", so that is what is returned. In the 2.xx
series, \*(L"Bolivia\*(R" was returned.  Also, the country names vary from one
standard to another. So the code \*(L"bol\*(R" which is maintained by the
United Nations returns the name of the country as \*(L"Bolivia
(Plurinational State of)\*(R". Some common aliases have been added, so you
can still request a code associated with a county name \*(L"Bolivia\*(R".
.Sp
Since the data comes from the standards, some \*(L"incorrect\*(R" values are
no longer supported. For example, 2.07 treated \*(L"Zaire\*(R" as an alias for
\&\*(L"Congo\*(R", but the country changed it's name, and \*(L"Zaire\*(R" is not in the
standard, so it has been dropped in 3.00.
.IP "\fBAdded new codeset(s)\fR" 4
.IX Item "Added new codeset(s)"
\&\s-1FIPS 10\s0 country codes (requested in \s-1RT 1755\s0)
.Sp
Alpha\-3 and Term language codes (requested in \s-1RT 11730\s0)
.Sp
Numeric currency codes (requested in \s-1RT 18797\s0)
.IP "\fB(*) (!) Locale::Script changed\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) (!) Locale::Script changed"
In 2.xx, Locale::Script assigned scripts to country codes, which is \s-1NOT\s0
how it is done currently in the standards. It appears that an older version
of \s-1ISO 15924\s0 did this, but I haven't found an old version to confirm
that, and in any case, that is not the case in the current standards.
.Sp
As a result, the Locale::Script module is completely incompatible with
the 2.xx version with respect to the types of codes it supports. None of
the old codes will work.
.IP "\fBAdded missing functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "Added missing functions"
I've added in some functions which were \*(L"missing\*(R" previously (since there was
only one set of codes supported, the code2code functions didn't apply):
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   language_code2code
\&   currency_code2code
.Ve
.Sp
so the interfaces for each type of codes are consistent.
.IP "\fB(!) Dropped support for _alias_code\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) Dropped support for _alias_code"
In Locale::Country, _alias_code was an allowed, but deprecated function
which was documented to be supported in the 2.xx series. I've removed it.
.IP "\fB(!) All functions return the standard value\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) All functions return the standard value"
code2country (and other equivalent functions) now returns the name of
the country specified in the standard (if the different standards
refer to the country by different variations in the name, the results
will differ based on the \s-1CODESET\s0)
.IP "\fB(!) rename_country function altered\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) rename_country function altered"
The rename_country function from 2.07 would guess the \s-1CODESET \s0(unlike
all other functions which used a default of \s-1LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2\s0). The
guess can cause problems since (with the addition of \s-1FIPS\s0) codes may
appear in different codesets for different countries. The behavior has
been changed to be the same as other functions (default to
\&\s-1LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2\s0).

The four modules which have data after _\|_DATA_\|_ weren't closing the

Documentation bug: one of the examples used => where the
lvalue was a constant, which isn't allowed, unless you
put the () with the constant to force the right interpretation.
Pointed out by \s-1TJ\s0 Mather and \s-1MYT.\s0
.PP
Updated the \s-1URL\s0 for the appendix in the \s-1CIA\s0 world factbook.

The old names are retained as aliases.
.PP
The alpha\-2 and alpha\-3 codes for East Timor have changed:
   tp \-> tl
   tmp \-> tls
the numeric code stays 626. If you want to support the old

.SH "VERSION 2.03  (2002\-03\-24; neilb)"
.IX Header "VERSION 2.03 (2002-03-24; neilb)"

Added semi-private routine \fIrename_country()\fR to Locale::Country,
based on a patch from Iain Chalmers.
.PP
Added test rename.t for the above function.
.PP
Renamed _alias_code to be alias_code. Have retained the old

.SH "VERSION 2.00  (2002\-02\-17; neilb)"
.IX Header "VERSION 2.00 (2002-02-17; neilb)"
Created Locale::Script which provides an interface to the \s-1ISO\s0 codes
for identification of scripts (writing scripts, rather than perl style
scripts). The codes are defined by \s-1ISO 15924,\s0 which is currently in
final draft.  Thanks to Jarkko for pointing out this new standard.
All three code sets are supported, and a test-suite added.
.PP
Added support for country name variants to Locale::Country,
so that
   country2code('\s-1USA\s0')
   country2code('United States')
   country2code('United States of America')
will all return 'us'.  This had been in the \s-1LIMITATIONS\s0 section since
the first version.  Patch from \s-1TJ\s0 Mather with additional variants from
me. Added test-cases for these.
.PP
Added \s-1VERSION\s0 to Locale::Constants. Thanks to Jarkko for
pointing that it was missing.
.PP
Should really have bumped major version with previous release,
since there was a change to the \s-1API.\s0
.SH "VERSION 1.06  (2001\-03\-04; neilb)"
.IX Header "VERSION 1.06 (2001-03-04; neilb)"

which codeset is being used:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2
\&   LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3
\&   LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC
.Ve
.PP
Updated Locale::Country to support all three code sets defined by \s-1ISO
3166.\s0 This was requested by Keith Wall.  I haven't added multiple
codeset support to the other modules yet \- I'll wait until someone
asks for them.
.SH "VERSION 1.05  (2001\-02\-13; neilb)"
.IX Header "VERSION 1.05 (2001-02-13; neilb)"
Added Locale::Currency, contribution from Michael Hennecke.

to t/all.t for the all_* functions.
.SH "VERSION 1.04  (2000\-12\-21; neilb)"

Updated Locale::Country:
   \- fixed spelling of a few countries
   \- added link to a relevant page from \s-1CIA\s0 world factbook
.PP
Updated Locale::Language:
   \- fixed typo in the documentation (\s-1ISO 939\s0 should be 639)
.SH "VERSION 1.02  (2000\-05\-04; neilb)"
.IX Header "VERSION 1.02 (2000-05-04; neilb)"
Updated Locale::Country and Locale::Language to reflect changes in the
relevant \s-1ISO\s0 standards. These mainly reflect languages which are new
to the relevant standard, and changes in the spelling of some country
names.
.PP
Added official URLs for the standards to the \s-1SEE ALSO\s0 sections of the
doc for each module.
.PP
Thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi for pointing me at the pages with latest
versions of \s-1ISO 3166\s0 and 639.
.SH "VERSION 1.00  (1998\-03\-09; neilb)"
.IX Header "VERSION 1.00 (1998-03-09; neilb)"
Added \fILocale::Country::_alias_code()\fR so that 'uk' can be added as the
code for \*(L"United Kingdom\*(R", if you want it.  This was prompted by Ed
Jordan.
.PP
Added a new test suite for handling this case, and extended the
existing test-suite to include testing of the case where 'uk' hasn't
been defined as a valid code.

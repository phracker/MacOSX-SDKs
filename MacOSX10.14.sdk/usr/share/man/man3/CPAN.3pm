.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1CPAN\s0 module automates or at least simplifies the make and install
of perl modules and extensions. It includes some primitive searching
capabilities and knows how to use \s-1LWP,\s0 HTTP::Tiny, Net::FTP and certain
external download clients to fetch distributions from the net.
.PP
These are fetched from one or more mirrored \s-1CPAN \s0(Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network) sites and unpacked in a dedicated directory.
.PP
The \s-1CPAN\s0 module also supports named and versioned
\&\fIbundles\fR of modules. Bundles simplify handling of sets of
related modules. See Bundles below.
.PP
The package contains a session manager and a cache manager. The
session manager keeps track of what has been fetched, built, and
installed in the current session. The cache manager keeps track of the
disk space occupied by the make processes and deletes excess space
using a simple \s-1FIFO\s0 mechanism.
.PP
All methods provided are accessible in a programmer style and in an
interactive shell style.

which puts you into a readline interface. If \f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadKey\*(C'\fR and
either of \f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadLine::Perl\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadLine::Gnu\*(C'\fR are installed,
history and command completion are supported.
.PP
Once at the command line, type \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR for one-page help
screen; the rest should be self-explanatory.
.PP
The function call \f(CW\*(C`shell\*(C'\fR takes two optional arguments: one the
prompt, the second the default initial command line (the latter
only works if a real ReadLine interface module is installed).
.PP
The most common uses of the interactive modes are
.IP "Searching for authors, bundles, distribution files and modules" 2
.IX Item "Searching for authors, bundles, distribution files and modules"
There are corresponding one-letter commands \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR
for each of the four categories and another, \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR for any of the
mentioned four. Each of the four entities is implemented as a class
with slightly differing methods for displaying an object.
.Sp
Arguments to these commands are either strings exactly matching
the identification string of an object, or regular expressions
matched case-insensitively against various attributes of the
objects. The parser only recognizes a regular expression when you
enclose it with slashes.
.Sp
The principle is that the number of objects found influences how an
item is displayed. If the search finds one item, the result is
displayed with the rather verbose method \f(CW\*(C`as_string\*(C'\fR, but if
more than one is found, each object is displayed with the terse method
\&\f(CW\*(C`as_glimpse\*(C'\fR.

The examples illustrate several aspects: the first three queries
target modules, authors, or distros directly and yield exactly one
result. The last two use regular expressions and yield several
results. The last one targets all of bundles, modules, authors, and
distros simultaneously. When more than one result is available, they
are printed in one-line format.
.ie n .IP """get"", ""make"", ""test"", ""install"", ""clean"" modules or distributions" 2
.el .IP "\f(CWget\fR, \f(CWmake\fR, \f(CWtest\fR, \f(CWinstall\fR, \f(CWclean\fR modules or distributions" 2
.IX Item "get, make, test, install, clean modules or distributions"
These commands take any number of arguments and investigate what is
necessary to perform the action. Argument processing is as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  known module name in format Foo/Bar.pm   module
\&  other embedded slash                     distribution
\&    \- with trailing slash dot              directory
\&  enclosing slashes                        regexp
\&  known module name in format Foo::Bar     module
.Ve
.Sp
If the argument is a distribution file name (recognized by embedded
slashes), it is processed. If it is a module, \s-1CPAN\s0 determines the
distribution file in which this module is included and processes that,
following any dependencies named in the module's \s-1META\s0.yml or
Makefile.PL (this behavior is controlled by the configuration
parameter \f(CW\*(C`prerequisites_policy\*(C'\fR). If an argument is enclosed in
slashes it is treated as a regular expression: it is expanded and if
the result is a single object (distribution, bundle or module), this
object is processed.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    install Dummy::Perl                   # installs the module
\&    install AUXXX/Dummy\-Perl\-3.14.tar.gz  # installs that distribution
\&    install /Dummy\-Perl\-3.14/             # same if the regexp is unambiguous
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR downloads a distribution file and untars or unzips it, \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR
builds it, \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR runs the test suite, and \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR installs it.
.Sp
Any \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR is run unconditionally. An
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  install <distribution_file>
.Ve
.Sp
is also run unconditionally. But for
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  install <module>
.Ve
.Sp
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 checks whether an install is needed and prints
\&\fImodule up to date\fR if the distribution file containing
the module doesn't need updating.
.Sp
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 also keeps track of what it has done within the current session
and doesn't try to build a package a second time regardless of whether it
succeeded or not. It does not repeat a test run if the test
has been run successfully before. Same for install runs.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`force\*(C'\fR pragma may precede another command (currently: \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR) to execute the command from scratch
and attempt to continue past certain errors. See the section below on
the \f(CW\*(C`force\*(C'\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`fforce\*(C'\fR pragma.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`notest\*(C'\fR pragma skips the test part in the build
process.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    cpan> notest install Tk
.Ve
.Sp
A \f(CW\*(C`clean\*(C'\fR command results in a
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  make clean
.Ve
.Sp
being executed within the distribution file's working directory.
.ie n .IP """readme"", ""perldoc"", ""look"" module or distribution" 2
.el .IP "\f(CWreadme\fR, \f(CWperldoc\fR, \f(CWlook\fR module or distribution" 2
.IX Item "readme, perldoc, look module or distribution"
\&\f(CW\*(C`readme\*(C'\fR displays the \s-1README\s0 file of the associated distribution.
\&\f(CW\*(C`Look\*(C'\fR gets and untars (if not yet done) the distribution file,
changes to the appropriate directory and opens a subshell process in
that directory. \f(CW\*(C`perldoc\*(C'\fR displays the module's pod documentation
in html or plain text format.
.ie n .IP """ls"" author" 2
.el .IP "\f(CWls\fR author" 2
.IX Item "ls author"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP """ls"" globbing_expression" 2
.el .IP "\f(CWls\fR globbing_expression" 2
.IX Item "ls globbing_expression"
.PD
The first form lists all distribution files in and below an author's
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 directory as stored in the \s-1CHECKUMS\s0 files distributed on
\&\s-1CPAN.\s0 The listing recurses into subdirectories.
.Sp
The second form limits or expands the output with shell
globbing as in the following examples:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&      ls JV/make*
\&      ls GSAR/*make*
\&      ls */*make*
.Ve
.Sp
The last example is very slow and outputs extra progress indicators
that break the alignment of the result.
.Sp
Note that globbing only lists directories explicitly asked for, for
example FOO/* will not list FOO/bar/Acme\-Sthg\-n.nn.tar.gz. This may be
regarded as a bug that may be changed in some future version.
.ie n .IP """failed""" 2
.el .IP "\f(CWfailed\fR" 2
.IX Item "failed"
The \f(CW\*(C`failed\*(C'\fR command reports all distributions that failed on one of
\&\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR for some reason in the currently
running shell session.
.IP "Persistence between sessions" 2
.IX Item "Persistence between sessions"
If the \f(CW\*(C`YAML\*(C'\fR or the \f(CW\*(C`YAML::Syck\*(C'\fR module is installed a record of
the internal state of all modules is written to disk after each step.
The files contain a signature of the currently running perl version
for later perusal.
.Sp
If the configurations variable \f(CW\*(C`build_dir_reuse\*(C'\fR is set to a true
value, then \s-1CPAN\s0.pm reads the collected \s-1YAML\s0 files. If the stored
signature matches the currently running perl, the stored state is
loaded into memory such that persistence between sessions
is effectively established.
.ie n .IP "The ""force"" and the ""fforce"" pragma" 2
.el .IP "The \f(CWforce\fR and the \f(CWfforce\fR pragma" 2
.IX Item "The force and the fforce pragma"
To speed things up in complex installation scenarios, \s-1CPAN\s0.pm keeps
track of what it has already done and refuses to do some things a
second time. A \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR, a \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR, and an \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR are not repeated.
A \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR is repeated only if the previous test was unsuccessful. The
diagnostic message when \s-1CPAN\s0.pm refuses to do something a second time
is one of \fIHas already been \fR\f(CW\*(C`unwrapped|made|tested successfully\*(C'\fR or
something similar. Another situation where \s-1CPAN\s0 refuses to act is an
\&\f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR if the corresponding \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR was not successful.
.Sp
In all these cases, the user can override this stubborn behaviour by
prepending the command with the word force, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  cpan> force get Foo
\&  cpan> force make AUTHOR/Bar\-3.14.tar.gz
\&  cpan> force test Baz
\&  cpan> force install Acme::Meta
.Ve
.Sp
Each \fIforced\fR command is executed with the corresponding part of its
memory erased.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`fforce\*(C'\fR pragma is a variant that emulates a \f(CW\*(C`force get\*(C'\fR which
erases the entire memory followed by the action specified, effectively
restarting the whole get/make/test/install procedure from scratch.
.IP "Lockfile" 2
.IX Item "Lockfile"
Interactive sessions maintain a lockfile, by default \f(CW\*(C`~/.cpan/.lock\*(C'\fR.
Batch jobs can run without a lockfile and not disturb each other.
.Sp
The shell offers to run in \fIdowngraded mode\fR when another process is
holding the lockfile. This is an experimental feature that is not yet
tested very well. This second shell then does not write the history
file, does not use the metadata file, and has a different prompt.
.IP "Signals" 2
.IX Item "Signals"
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm installs signal handlers for \s-1SIGINT\s0 and \s-1SIGTERM.\s0 While you are
in the cpan-shell, it is intended that you can press \f(CW\*(C`^C\*(C'\fR anytime and
return to the cpan-shell prompt. A \s-1SIGTERM\s0 will cause the cpan-shell
to clean up and leave the shell loop. You can emulate the effect of a
\&\s-1SIGTERM\s0 by sending two consecutive SIGINTs, which usually means by
pressing \f(CW\*(C`^C\*(C'\fR twice.
.Sp
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm ignores \s-1SIGPIPE.\s0 If the user sets \f(CW\*(C`inactivity_timeout\*(C'\fR, a
\&\s-1SIGALRM\s0 is used during the run of the \f(CW\*(C`perl Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`perl
Build.PL\*(C'\fR subprocess. A \s-1SIGALRM\s0 is also used during module version
parsing, and is controlled by \f(CW\*(C`version_timeout\*(C'\fR.
.SS "CPAN::Shell"
.IX Subsection "CPAN::Shell"
The commands available in the shell interface are methods in
the package CPAN::Shell. If you enter the shell command, your
input is split by the \fIText::ParseWords::shellwords()\fR routine, which
acts like most shells do. The first word is interpreted as the
method to be invoked, and the rest of the words are treated as the method's arguments.
Continuation lines are supported by ending a line with a
literal backslash.
.SS "autobundle"
.IX Subsection "autobundle"
\&\f(CW\*(C`autobundle\*(C'\fR writes a bundle file into the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$CPAN::Config\->{cpan_home}/Bundle\*(C'\fR directory. The file contains
a list of all modules that are both available from \s-1CPAN\s0 and currently
installed within \f(CW@INC\fR. Duplicates of each distribution are suppressed.
The name of the bundle file is based on the current date and a
counter, e.g. \fIBundle/Snapshot_2012_05_21_00.pm\fR. This is installed
again by running \f(CW\*(C`cpan Bundle::Snapshot_2012_05_21_00\*(C'\fR, or installing
\&\f(CW\*(C`Bundle::Snapshot_2012_05_21_00\*(C'\fR from the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell.
.PP
Return value: path to the written file.

activities. The data for this is collected in the \s-1YAML\s0 file
\&\f(CW\*(C`FTPstats.yml\*(C'\fR in your \f(CW\*(C`cpan_home\*(C'\fR directory. If no \s-1YAML\s0 module is

available on \s-1CPAN\s0 and provides a list of them. If called without
argument, all potential upgrades are listed; if called with arguments
the list is filtered to the modules and regexps given as arguments.

.SS "recent ***EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND***"
.IX Subsection "recent ***EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND***"
The \f(CW\*(C`recent\*(C'\fR command downloads a list of recent uploads to \s-1CPAN\s0 and
displays them \fIslowly\fR. While the command is running, a \f(CW$SIG\fR{\s-1INT\s0}
exits the loop after displaying the current item.

.SS "recompile"
.IX Subsection "recompile"
\&\fIrecompile()\fR is a special command that takes no argument and
runs the make/test/install cycle with brute force over all installed
dynamically loadable extensions (a.k.a. \s-1XS\s0 modules) with 'force' in
effect. The primary purpose of this command is to finish a network
installation. Imagine you have a common source tree for two different
architectures. You decide to do a completely independent fresh
installation. You start on one architecture with the help of a Bundle
file produced earlier. \s-1CPAN\s0 installs the whole Bundle for you, but
when you try to repeat the job on the second architecture, \s-1CPAN\s0
responds with a \f(CW"Foo up to date"\fR message for all modules. So you
invoke \s-1CPAN\s0's recompile on the second architecture and you're done.
.PP
Another popular use for \f(CW\*(C`recompile\*(C'\fR is to act as a rescue in case your
perl breaks binary compatibility. If one of the modules that \s-1CPAN\s0 uses
is in turn depending on binary compatibility (so you cannot run \s-1CPAN\s0
commands), then you should try the CPAN::Nox module for recovery.
.SS "report Bundle|Distribution|Module"
.IX Subsection "report Bundle|Distribution|Module"
The \f(CW\*(C`report\*(C'\fR command temporarily turns on the \f(CW\*(C`test_report\*(C'\fR config
variable, then runs the \f(CW\*(C`force test\*(C'\fR command with the given
arguments. The \f(CW\*(C`force\*(C'\fR pragma reruns the tests and repeats
every step that might have failed before.
.SS "smoke ***EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND***"
.IX Subsection "smoke ***EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND***"
\&\fB*** \s-1WARNING:\s0 this command downloads and executes software from \s-1CPAN\s0 to
your computer of completely unknown status. You should never do
this with your normal account and better have a dedicated well
separated and secured machine to do this. ***\fR
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`smoke\*(C'\fR command takes the list of recent uploads to \s-1CPAN\s0 as
provided by the \f(CW\*(C`recent\*(C'\fR command and tests them all. While the
command is running \f(CW$SIG\fR{\s-1INT\s0} is defined to mean that the current item
shall be skipped.

.SS "upgrade [Module|/Regexp/]..."
.IX Subsection "upgrade [Module|/Regexp/]..."
The \f(CW\*(C`upgrade\*(C'\fR command first runs an \f(CW\*(C`r\*(C'\fR command with the given
arguments and then installs the newest versions of all modules that
were listed by that.
.ie n .SS "The four ""CPAN::*"" Classes: Author, Bundle, Module, Distribution"
.el .SS "The four \f(CWCPAN::*\fP Classes: Author, Bundle, Module, Distribution"
.IX Subsection "The four CPAN::* Classes: Author, Bundle, Module, Distribution"
Although it may be considered internal, the class hierarchy does matter
for both users and programmer. \s-1CPAN\s0.pm deals with the four
classes mentioned above, and those classes all share a set of methods. Classical
single polymorphism is in effect. A metaclass object registers all
objects of all kinds and indexes them with a string. The strings
referencing objects have a separated namespace (well, not completely
separated):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&         Namespace                         Class
\&
\&   words containing a "/" (slash)      Distribution
\&    words starting with Bundle::          Bundle
\&          everything else            Module or Author
.Ve
.PP
Modules know their associated Distribution objects. They always refer
to the most recent official release. Developers may mark their releases
as unstable development versions (by inserting an underbar into the
module version number which will also be reflected in the distribution
name when you run 'make dist'), so the really hottest and newest
distribution is not always the default.  If a module Foo circulates
on \s-1CPAN\s0 in both version 1.23 and 1.23_90, \s-1CPAN\s0.pm offers a convenient
way to install version 1.23 by saying
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    install Foo
.Ve
.PP
This would install the complete distribution file (say
BAR/Foo\-1.23.tar.gz) with all accompanying material. But if you would
like to install version 1.23_90, you need to know where the
distribution file resides on \s-1CPAN\s0 relative to the authors/id/
directory. If the author is \s-1BAR,\s0 this might be BAR/Foo\-1.23_90.tar.gz;
so you would have to say
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    install BAR/Foo\-1.23_90.tar.gz
.Ve
.PP
The first example will be driven by an object of the class
CPAN::Module, the second by an object of class CPAN::Distribution.
.SS "Integrating local directories"
.IX Subsection "Integrating local directories"
Note: this feature is still in alpha state and may change in future
versions of \s-1CPAN\s0.pm
.PP
Distribution objects are normally distributions from the \s-1CPAN,\s0 but
there is a slightly degenerate case for Distribution objects, too, of
projects held on the local disk. These distribution objects have the
same name as the local directory and end with a dot. A dot by itself
is also allowed for the current directory at the time \s-1CPAN\s0.pm was
used. All actions such as \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR are applied
directly to that directory. This gives the command \f(CW\*(C`cpan .\*(C'\fR an
interesting touch: while the normal mantra of installing a \s-1CPAN\s0 module
without \s-1CPAN\s0.pm is one of
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    perl Makefile.PL                 perl Build.PL
\&           ( go and get prerequisites )
\&    make                             ./Build
\&    make test                        ./Build test
\&    make install                     ./Build install
.Ve
.PP
the command \f(CW\*(C`cpan .\*(C'\fR does all of this at once. It figures out which
of the two mantras is appropriate, fetches and installs all
prerequisites, takes care of them recursively, and finally finishes the
installation of the module in the current directory, be it a \s-1CPAN\s0
module or not.
.PP
The typical usage case is for private modules or working copies of
projects from remote repositories on the local disk.
.SS "Redirection"
.IX Subsection "Redirection"
The usual shell redirection symbols \f(CW\*(C` | \*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR are recognized
by the cpan shell \fBonly when surrounded by whitespace\fR. So piping to
pager or redirecting output into a file works somewhat as in a normal
shell, with the stipulation that you must type extra spaces.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
When the \s-1CPAN\s0 module is used for the first time, a configuration
dialogue tries to determine a couple of site specific options. The
result of the dialog is stored in a hash reference \f(CW $CPAN::Config \fR
in a file CPAN/Config.pm.
.PP
Default values defined in the CPAN/Config.pm file can be
overridden in a user specific file: CPAN/MyConfig.pm. Such a file is
best placed in \f(CW\*(C`$HOME/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm\*(C'\fR, because \f(CW\*(C`$HOME/.cpan\*(C'\fR is
added to the search path of the \s-1CPAN\s0 module before the \fIuse()\fR or
\&\fIrequire()\fR statements. The mkmyconfig command writes this file for you.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`o conf\*(C'\fR command has various bells and whistles:
.IP "completion support" 4
.IX Item "completion support"
If you have a ReadLine module installed, you can hit \s-1TAB\s0 at any point
of the commandline and \f(CW\*(C`o conf\*(C'\fR will offer you completion for the
built-in subcommands and/or config variable names.
.IP "displaying some help: o conf help" 4
.IX Item "displaying some help: o conf help"
Displays a short help
.IP "displaying current values: o conf [\s-1KEY\s0]" 4
.IX Item "displaying current values: o conf [KEY]"
Displays the current value(s) for this config variable. Without \s-1KEY,\s0
displays all subcommands and config variables.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  o conf shell
.Ve
.Sp
If \s-1KEY\s0 starts and ends with a slash, the string in between is
treated as a regular expression and only keys matching this regexp
are displayed
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  o conf /color/
.Ve
.IP "changing of scalar values: o conf \s-1KEY VALUE\s0" 4
.IX Item "changing of scalar values: o conf KEY VALUE"
Sets the config variable \s-1KEY\s0 to \s-1VALUE.\s0 The empty string can be
specified as usual in shells, with \f(CW\*(Aq\*(Aq\fR or \f(CW""\fR
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  o conf wget /usr/bin/wget
.Ve
.IP "changing of list values: o conf \s-1KEY\s0 SHIFT|UNSHIFT|PUSH|POP|SPLICE|LIST" 4
.IX Item "changing of list values: o conf KEY SHIFT|UNSHIFT|PUSH|POP|SPLICE|LIST"
If a config variable name ends with \f(CW\*(C`list\*(C'\fR, it is a list. \f(CW\*(C`o conf
KEY shift\*(C'\fR removes the first element of the list, \f(CW\*(C`o conf KEY pop\*(C'\fR
removes the last element of the list. \f(CW\*(C`o conf KEYS unshift LIST\*(C'\fR
prepends a list of values to the list, \f(CW\*(C`o conf KEYS push LIST\*(C'\fR
appends a list of valued to the list.
.Sp
Likewise, \f(CW\*(C`o conf KEY splice LIST\*(C'\fR passes the \s-1LIST\s0 to the corresponding
splice command.
.Sp
Finally, any other list of arguments is taken as a new list value for
the \s-1KEY\s0 variable discarding the previous value.
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  o conf urllist unshift http://cpan.dev.local/CPAN
\&  o conf urllist splice 3 1
\&  o conf urllist http://cpan1.local http://cpan2.local ftp://ftp.perl.org
.Ve
.IP "reverting to saved: o conf defaults" 4
.IX Item "reverting to saved: o conf defaults"
Reverts all config variables to the state in the saved config file.
.IP "saving the config: o conf commit" 4
.IX Item "saving the config: o conf commit"
Saves all config variables to the current config file (CPAN/Config.pm
or CPAN/MyConfig.pm that was loaded at start).
.PP
The configuration dialog can be started any time later again by
issuing the command \f(CW\*(C` o conf init \*(C'\fR in the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell. A subset of
the configuration dialog can be run by issuing \f(CW\*(C`o conf init WORD\*(C'\fR
where \s-1WORD\s0 is any valid config variable or a regular expression.

urllist parameters are URLs according to \s-1RFC 1738.\s0 We do a little
guessing if your \s-1URL\s0 is not compliant, but if you have problems with
\&\f(CW\*(C`file\*(C'\fR URLs, please try the correct format. Either:
.PP
.Vb 1

.SS "The urllist parameter has CD-ROM support"
.IX Subsection "The urllist parameter has CD-ROM support"
The \f(CW\*(C`urllist\*(C'\fR parameter of the configuration table contains a list of
URLs used for downloading. If the list contains any
\&\f(CW\*(C`file\*(C'\fR URLs, \s-1CPAN\s0 always tries there first. This
feature is disabled for index files. So the recommendation for the
owner of a CD-ROM with \s-1CPAN\s0 contents is: include your local, possibly
outdated CD-ROM as a \f(CW\*(C`file\*(C'\fR \s-1URL\s0 at the end of urllist, e.g.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  o conf urllist push file://localhost/CDROM/CPAN
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm will then fetch the index files from one of the \s-1CPAN\s0 sites
that come at the beginning of urllist. It will later check for each
module to see whether there is a local copy of the most recent version.
.PP
Another peculiarity of urllist is that the site that we could
successfully fetch the last file from automatically gets a preference
token and is tried as the first site for the next request. So if you
add a new site at runtime it may happen that the previously preferred
site will be tried another time. This means that if you want to disallow
a site for the next transfer, it must be explicitly removed from
urllist.
.SS "Maintaining the urllist parameter"
.IX Subsection "Maintaining the urllist parameter"
If you have \s-1YAML\s0.pm (or some other \s-1YAML\s0 module configured in
\&\f(CW\*(C`yaml_module\*(C'\fR) installed, \s-1CPAN\s0.pm collects a few statistical data
about recent downloads. You can view the statistics with the \f(CW\*(C`hosts\*(C'\fR
command or inspect them directly by looking into the \f(CW\*(C`FTPstats.yml\*(C'\fR
file in your \f(CW\*(C`cpan_home\*(C'\fR directory.
.PP
To get some interesting statistics, it is recommended that
\&\f(CW\*(C`randomize_urllist\*(C'\fR be set; this introduces some amount of
randomness into the \s-1URL\s0 selection.
.ie n .SS "The ""requires"" and ""build_requires"" dependency declarations"
.el .SS "The \f(CWrequires\fP and \f(CWbuild_requires\fP dependency declarations"
.IX Subsection "The requires and build_requires dependency declarations"
Since \s-1CPAN\s0.pm version 1.88_51 modules declared as \f(CW\*(C`build_requires\*(C'\fR by
a distribution are treated differently depending on the config
variable \f(CW\*(C`build_requires_install_policy\*(C'\fR. By setting
\&\f(CW\*(C`build_requires_install_policy\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR, such a module is not
installed. It is only built and tested, and then kept in the list of
tested but uninstalled modules. As such, it is available during the
build of the dependent module by integrating the path to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`blib/arch\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`blib/lib\*(C'\fR directories in the environment variable
\&\s-1PERL5LIB.\s0 If \f(CW\*(C`build_requires_install_policy\*(C'\fR is set ti \f(CW\*(C`yes\*(C'\fR, then
both modules declared as \f(CW\*(C`requires\*(C'\fR and those declared as
\&\f(CW\*(C`build_requires\*(C'\fR are treated alike. By setting to \f(CW\*(C`ask/yes\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`ask/no\*(C'\fR, \s-1CPAN\s0.pm asks the user and sets the default accordingly.
.SS "Configuration for individual distributions (\fIDistroprefs\fP)"
.IX Subsection "Configuration for individual distributions (Distroprefs)"
(\fBNote:\fR This feature has been introduced in \s-1CPAN\s0.pm 1.8854 and is
still considered beta quality)
.PP
Distributions on \s-1CPAN\s0 usually behave according to what we call the
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 mantra. Or since the advent of Module::Build we should talk about
two mantras:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    perl Makefile.PL     perl Build.PL
\&    make                 ./Build
\&    make test            ./Build test
\&    make install         ./Build install
.Ve
.PP
But some modules cannot be built with this mantra. They try to get
some extra data from the user via the environment, extra arguments, or
interactively\*(--thus disturbing the installation of large bundles like
Phalanx100 or modules with many dependencies like Plagger.
.PP
The distroprefs system of \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR addresses this problem by
allowing the user to specify extra informations and recipes in \s-1YAML\s0
files to either
.IP "\(bu" 4
pass additional arguments to one of the four commands,
.IP "\(bu" 4
set environment variables
.IP "\(bu" 4
instantiate an Expect object that reads from the console, waits for
some regular expressions and enters some answers
.IP "\(bu" 4
temporarily override assorted \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR configuration variables
.IP "\(bu" 4
specify dependencies the original maintainer forgot
.IP "\(bu" 4
disable the installation of an object altogether
.PP
See the \s-1YAML\s0 and Data::Dumper files that come with the \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR
distribution in the \f(CW\*(C`distroprefs/\*(C'\fR directory for examples.
.SS "Filenames"
.IX Subsection "Filenames"
The \s-1YAML\s0 files themselves must have the \f(CW\*(C`.yml\*(C'\fR extension; all other
files are ignored (for two exceptions see \fIFallback Data::Dumper and
Storable\fR below). The containing directory can be specified in
\&\f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`prefs_dir\*(C'\fR config variable. Try \f(CW\*(C`o conf init
prefs_dir\*(C'\fR in the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell to set and activate the distroprefs
system.
.PP
Every \s-1YAML\s0 file may contain arbitrary documents according to the \s-1YAML\s0
specification, and every document is treated as an entity that
can specify the treatment of a single distribution.
.PP
Filenames can be picked arbitrarily; \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR always reads
all files (in alphabetical order) and takes the key \f(CW\*(C`match\*(C'\fR (see
below in \fILanguage Specs\fR) as a hashref containing match criteria
that determine if the current distribution matches the \s-1YAML\s0 document
or not.
.SS "Fallback Data::Dumper and Storable"
.IX Subsection "Fallback Data::Dumper and Storable"
If neither your configured \f(CW\*(C`yaml_module\*(C'\fR nor \s-1YAML\s0.pm is installed,
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm falls back to using Data::Dumper and Storable and looks for
files with the extensions \f(CW\*(C`.dd\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`.st\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`prefs_dir\*(C'\fR
directory. These files are expected to contain one or more hashrefs.
For Data::Dumper generated files, this is expected to be done with by
defining \f(CW$VAR1\fR, \f(CW$VAR2\fR, etc. The \s-1YAML\s0 shell would produce these
with the command
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ysh < somefile.yml > somefile.dd
.Ve
.PP
For Storable files the rule is that they must be constructed such that
\&\f(CW\*(C`Storable::retrieve(file)\*(C'\fR returns an array reference and the array
elements represent one distropref object each. The conversion from
\&\s-1YAML\s0 would look like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    perl \-MYAML=LoadFile \-MStorable=nstore \-e \*(Aq
\&        @y=LoadFile(shift);
\&        nstore(\e@y, shift)\*(Aq somefile.yml somefile.st
.Ve
.PP
In bootstrapping situations it is usually sufficient to translate only
a few \s-1YAML\s0 files to Data::Dumper for crucial modules like
\&\f(CW\*(C`YAML::Syck\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`YAML.pm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Expect.pm\*(C'\fR. If you prefer Storable
over Data::Dumper, remember to pull out a Storable version that writes
an older format than all the other Storable versions that will need to
read them.

\&\f(CW\*(C`talk\*(C'\fR is a reference to an array that contains alternating questions

used again accidentally. If you want to answer the
question \f(CW\*(C`Do you really want to do that\*(C'\fR several times, then it must

High-level commands do such initializations automatically.

If you prefer to do it more in a programmerish style in one single

.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::install()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Distribution::install()"
Changes to the directory where the distribution has been unpacked and
runs the external command \f(CW\*(C`make install\*(C'\fR there. If \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR has not
yet been run, it will be run first. A \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR is issued in

cancellation can be avoided by letting \f(CW\*(C`force\*(C'\fR run the \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR for
you.
.Sp
This install method only has the power to install the distribution if
there are no dependencies in the way. To install an object along with all
its dependencies, use CPAN::Shell\->install.

.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::prefs()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Distribution::prefs()"
Returns the hash reference from the first matching \s-1YAML\s0 file that the
user has deposited in the \f(CW\*(C`prefs_dir/\*(C'\fR directory. The first
succeeding match wins. The files in the \f(CW\*(C`prefs_dir/\*(C'\fR are processed
alphabetically, and the canonical distro name (e.g.
AUTHOR/Foo\-Bar\-3.14.tar.gz) is matched against the regular expressions
stored in the \f(CW$root\fR\->{match}{distribution} attribute value.
Additionally all module names contained in a distribution are matched
against the regular expressions in the \f(CW$root\fR\->{match}{module} attribute
value. The two match values are ANDed together. Each of the two
attributes are optional.

Returns the hash reference that has been announced by a distribution
as the \f(CW\*(C`requires\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`build_requires\*(C'\fR elements. These can be
declared either by the \f(CW\*(C`META.yml\*(C'\fR (if authoritative) or can be
deposited after the run of \f(CW\*(C`Build.PL\*(C'\fR in the file \f(CW\*(C`./_build/prereqs\*(C'\fR

.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::read_yaml()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Distribution::read_yaml()"
Returns the content of the \s-1META\s0.yml of this distro as a hashref. Note:
works only after an attempt has been made to \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR the distribution.
Returns undef otherwise. Also returns undef if the content of \s-1META\s0.yml
is not authoritative. (The rules about what exactly makes the content
authoritative are still in flux.)
.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::test()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Distribution::test()"
Changes to the directory where the distribution has been unpacked and
runs \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR there.
.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::uptodate()\fR" 4

.IP "\fICPAN::Module::available_file()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Module::available_file()"
Returns the filename of the module found in \s-1PERL5LIB\s0 or \f(CW@INC\fR. The
first file found is reported. The advantage of this method over
\&\f(CW\*(C`inst_file\*(C'\fR is that modules that have been tested but not yet

.IX Item "CPAN::Module::userid()"
Returns the author's \s-1ID\s0 of the module.
.SS "Cache Manager"
.IX Subsection "Cache Manager"
Currently the cache manager only keeps track of the build directory
($CPAN::Config\->{build_dir}). It is a simple \s-1FIFO\s0 mechanism that
deletes complete directories below \f(CW\*(C`build_dir\*(C'\fR as soon as the size of
all directories there gets bigger than \f(CW$CPAN::Config\fR\->{build_cache}
(in \s-1MB\s0). The contents of this cache may be used for later
re-installations that you intend to do manually, but will never be
trusted by \s-1CPAN\s0 itself. This is due to the fact that the user might
use these directories for building modules on different architectures.
.PP
There is another directory ($CPAN::Config\->{keep_source_where}) where
the original distribution files are kept. This directory is not
covered by the cache manager and must be controlled by the user. If
you choose to have the same directory as build_dir and as
keep_source_where directory, then your sources will be deleted with
the same fifo mechanism.
.SS "Bundles"
.IX Subsection "Bundles"
A bundle is just a perl module in the namespace Bundle:: that does not
define any functions or methods. It usually only contains documentation.
.PP
It starts like a perl module with a package declaration and a \f(CW$VERSION\fR
variable. After that the pod section looks like any other pod with the
only difference being that \fIone special pod section\fR exists starting with
(verbatim):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    =head1 CONTENTS
.Ve
.PP
In this pod section each line obeys the format
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        Module_Name [Version_String] [\- optional text]
.Ve
.PP
The only required part is the first field, the name of a module
(e.g. Foo::Bar, i.e. \fInot\fR the name of the distribution file). The rest
of the line is optional. The comment part is delimited by a dash just
as in the man page header.
.PP
The distribution of a bundle should follow the same convention as
other distributions.
.PP
Bundles are treated specially in the \s-1CPAN\s0 package. If you say 'install
Bundle::Tkkit' (assuming such a bundle exists), \s-1CPAN\s0 will install all
the modules in the \s-1CONTENTS\s0 section of the pod. You can install your
own Bundles locally by placing a conformant Bundle file somewhere into
your \f(CW@INC\fR path. The \fIautobundle()\fR command which is available in the
shell interface does that for you by including all currently installed
modules in a snapshot bundle file.
.SH "PREREQUISITES"
.IX Header "PREREQUISITES"
The \s-1CPAN\s0 program is trying to depend on as little as possible so the
user can use it in hostile environment. It works better the more goodies
the environment provides. For example if you try in the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  install Bundle::CPAN
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  install Bundle::CPANxxl
.Ve
.PP
you will find the shell more convenient than the bare shell before.
.PP
If you have a local mirror of \s-1CPAN\s0 and can access all files with
\&\*(L"file:\*(R" URLs, then you only need a perl later than perl5.003 to run
this module. Otherwise Net::FTP is strongly recommended. \s-1LWP\s0 may be
required for non-UNIX systems, or if your nearest \s-1CPAN\s0 site is
associated with a \s-1URL\s0 that is not \f(CW\*(C`ftp:\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If you have neither Net::FTP nor \s-1LWP,\s0 there is a fallback mechanism
implemented for an external ftp command or for an external lynx
command.
.SH "UTILITIES"
.IX Header "UTILITIES"
.SS "Finding packages and \s-1VERSION\s0"
.IX Subsection "Finding packages and VERSION"
This module presumes that all packages on \s-1CPAN\s0
.IP "\(bu" 2
declare their \f(CW$VERSION\fR variable in an easy to parse manner. This
prerequisite can hardly be relaxed because it consumes far too much
memory to load all packages into the running program just to determine
the \f(CW$VERSION\fR variable. Currently all programs that are dealing with
version use something like this
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    perl \-MExtUtils::MakeMaker \-le \e
\&        \*(Aqprint MM\->parse_version(shift)\*(Aq filename
.Ve
.Sp
If you are author of a package and wonder if your \f(CW$VERSION\fR can be
parsed, please try the above method.
.IP "\(bu" 2
come as compressed or gzipped tarfiles or as zip files and contain a
\&\f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Build.PL\*(C'\fR (well, we try to handle a bit more, but
with little enthusiasm).
.SS "Debugging"
.IX Subsection "Debugging"
Debugging this module is more than a bit complex due to interference from
the software producing the indices on \s-1CPAN,\s0 the mirroring process on \s-1CPAN,\s0
packaging, configuration, synchronicity, and even (gasp!) due to bugs
within the \s-1CPAN\s0.pm module itself.
.PP
For debugging the code of \s-1CPAN\s0.pm itself in interactive mode, some
debugging aid can be turned on for most packages within
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm with one of
.IP "o debug package..." 2
.IX Item "o debug package..."

For debugging of \s-1CPAN\s0 data there is the \f(CW\*(C`dump\*(C'\fR command which takes
the same arguments as make/test/install and outputs each object's
Data::Dumper dump. If an argument looks like a perl variable and

.SH "SECURITY"
.IX Header "SECURITY"
There's no strong security layer in \s-1CPAN\s0.pm. \s-1CPAN\s0.pm helps you to
install foreign, unmasked, unsigned code on your machine. We compare
to a checksum that comes from the net just as the distribution file
itself. But we try to make it easy to add security on demand:
.SS "Cryptographically signed modules"
.IX Subsection "Cryptographically signed modules"
Since release 1.77, \s-1CPAN\s0.pm has been able to verify cryptographically
signed module distributions using Module::Signature.  The \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
can be signed by their authors, thus giving more security.  The simple
unsigned \s-1MD5\s0 checksums that were used before by \s-1CPAN\s0 protect mainly
against accidental file corruption.
.PP
You will need to have Module::Signature installed, which in turn
requires that you have at least one of Crypt::OpenPGP module or the
command-line \fIgpg\fR tool installed.
.PP
You will also need to be able to connect over the Internet to the public
key servers, like pgp.mit.edu, and their port 11731 (the \s-1HKP\s0 protocol).
.PP
The configuration parameter check_sigs is there to turn signature
checking on or off.
.SH "EXPORT"
.IX Header "EXPORT"
Most functions in package \s-1CPAN\s0 are exported by default. The reason
for this is that the primary use is intended for the cpan shell or for
one-liners.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
When the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell enters a subshell via the look command, it sets
the environment \s-1CPAN_SHELL_LEVEL\s0 to 1, or increments that variable if it is
already set.
.PP
When \s-1CPAN\s0 runs, it sets the environment variable \s-1PERL5_CPAN_IS_RUNNING\s0
to the \s-1ID\s0 of the running process. It also sets
\&\s-1PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_RUNNING\s0 to prevent runaway processes which could
happen with older versions of Module::Install.
.PP
When running \f(CW\*(C`perl Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR, the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL5_CPAN_IS_EXECUTING\*(C'\fR is set to the full path of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR that is being executed. This prevents runaway processes
with newer versions of Module::Install.
.PP
When the config variable ftp_passive is set, all downloads will be run
with the environment variable \s-1FTP_PASSIVE\s0 set to this value. This is
in general a good idea as it influences both Net::FTP and \s-1LWP\s0 based
connections. The same effect can be achieved by starting the cpan
shell with this environment variable set. For Net::FTP alone, one can
also always set passive mode by running libnetcfg.
.SH "POPULATE AN INSTALLATION WITH LOTS OF MODULES"
.IX Header "POPULATE AN INSTALLATION WITH LOTS OF MODULES"
Populating a freshly installed perl with one's favorite modules is pretty
easy if you maintain a private bundle definition file. To get a useful
blueprint of a bundle definition file, the command autobundle can be used
on the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell command line. This command writes a bundle definition
file for all modules installed for the current perl
interpreter. It's recommended to run this command once only, and from then
on maintain the file manually under a private name, say
Bundle/my_bundle.pm. With a clever bundle file you can then simply say
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    cpan> install Bundle::my_bundle
.Ve
.PP
then answer a few questions and go out for coffee (possibly
even in a different city).
.PP
Maintaining a bundle definition file means keeping track of two
things: dependencies and interactivity. \s-1CPAN\s0.pm sometimes fails on
calculating dependencies because not all modules define all MakeMaker
attributes correctly, so a bundle definition file should specify
prerequisites as early as possible. On the other hand, it's
annoying that so many distributions need some interactive configuring. So
what you can try to accomplish in your private bundle file is to have the
packages that need to be configured early in the file and the gentle
ones later, so you can go out for coffee after a few minutes and leave \s-1CPAN\s0.pm
to churn away unattended.
.SH "WORKING WITH CPAN.pm BEHIND FIREWALLS"
.IX Header "WORKING WITH CPAN.pm BEHIND FIREWALLS"
Thanks to Graham Barr for contributing the following paragraphs about
the interaction between perl, and various firewall configurations. For
further information on firewalls, it is recommended to consult the
documentation that comes with the \fIncftp\fR program. If you are unable to
go through the firewall with a simple Perl setup, it is likely
that you can configure \fIncftp\fR so that it works through your firewall.
.SS "Three basic types of firewalls"
.IX Subsection "Three basic types of firewalls"
Firewalls can be categorized into three basic types.
.IP "http firewall" 4
.IX Item "http firewall"
This is when the firewall machine runs a web server, and to access the
outside world, you must do so via that web server. If you set environment
variables like http_proxy or ftp_proxy to values beginning with http://,
or in your web browser you've proxy information set, then you know
you are running behind an http firewall.
.Sp
To access servers outside these types of firewalls with perl (even for
ftp), you need \s-1LWP\s0 or HTTP::Tiny.
.IP "ftp firewall" 4
.IX Item "ftp firewall"
This where the firewall machine runs an ftp server. This kind of
firewall will only let you access ftp servers outside the firewall.
This is usually done by connecting to the firewall with ftp, then
entering a username like \*(L"user@outside.host.com\*(R".
.Sp
To access servers outside these type of firewalls with perl, you
need Net::FTP.
.IP "One-way visibility" 4
.IX Item "One-way visibility"
One-way visibility means these firewalls try to make themselves
invisible to users inside the firewall. An \s-1FTP\s0 data connection is
normally created by sending your \s-1IP\s0 address to the remote server and then
listening for the return connection. But the remote server will not be able to
connect to you because of the firewall. For these types of firewall,
\&\s-1FTP\s0 connections need to be done in a passive mode.
.Sp
There are two that I can think off.
.RS 4
.IP "\s-1SOCKS\s0" 4
.IX Item "SOCKS"
If you are using a \s-1SOCKS\s0 firewall, you will need to compile perl and link
it with the \s-1SOCKS\s0 library.  This is what is normally called a 'socksified'
perl. With this executable you will be able to connect to servers outside
the firewall as if it were not there.
.IP "\s-1IP\s0 Masquerade" 4
.IX Item "IP Masquerade"
This is when the firewall implemented in the kernel (via \s-1NAT,\s0 or networking
address translation), it allows you to hide a complete network behind one
\&\s-1IP\s0 address. With this firewall no special compiling is needed as you can
access hosts directly.
.Sp
For accessing ftp servers behind such firewalls you usually need to
set the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`FTP_PASSIVE\*(C'\fR or the config variable
ftp_passive to a true value.

I installed a new version of module X but \s-1CPAN\s0 keeps saying,

.Sp
Probably you \fBdo\fR have the old version installed. This can
happen if a module installs itself into a different directory in the
\&\f(CW@INC\fR path than it was previously installed. This is not really a
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm problem, you would have the same problem when installing the
module manually. The easiest way to prevent this behaviour is to add
the argument \f(CW\*(C`UNINST=1\*(C'\fR to the \f(CW\*(C`make install\*(C'\fR call, and that is why
many people add this argument permanently by configuring
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  o conf make_install_arg UNINST=1
.Ve
.IP "2)" 4
.IX Item "2)"
So why is UNINST=1 not the default?
.Sp
Because there are people who have their precise expectations about who
may install where in the \f(CW@INC\fR path and who uses which \f(CW@INC\fR array. In
fine tuned environments \f(CW\*(C`UNINST=1\*(C'\fR can cause damage.
.IP "3)" 4
.IX Item "3)"
I want to clean up my mess, and install a new perl along with
all modules I have. How do I go about it?
.Sp
Run the autobundle command for your old perl and optionally rename the
resulting bundle file (e.g. Bundle/mybundle.pm), install the new perl
with the Configure option prefix, e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ./Configure \-Dprefix=/usr/local/perl\-5.6.78.9
.Ve
.Sp
Install the bundle file you produced in the first step with something like
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Sp
and you're done.
.IP "4)" 4
.IX Item "4)"
When I install bundles or multiple modules with one command

I am not root, how can I install a module in a personal directory?
.Sp
As of \s-1CPAN 1.9463,\s0 if you do not have permission to write the default perl
library directories, \s-1CPAN\s0's configuration process will ask you whether
you want to bootstrap <local::lib>, which makes keeping a personal
perl library directory easy.
.Sp
Another thing you should bear in mind is that the \s-1UNINST\s0 parameter can
be dangerous when you are installing into a private area because you
might accidentally remove modules that other people depend on that are
not using the private area.

.IP "7)" 4
.IX Item "7)"
I installed a Bundle and had a couple of fails. When I
retried, everything resolved nicely. Can this be fixed to work
on first try?
.Sp
The reason for this is that \s-1CPAN\s0 does not know the dependencies of all
modules when it starts out. To decide about the additional items to
install, it just uses data found in the \s-1META\s0.yml file or the generated
Makefile. An undetected missing piece breaks the process. But it may
well be that your Bundle installs some prerequisite later than some
depending item and thus your second try is able to resolve everything.
Please note, \s-1CPAN\s0.pm does not know the dependency tree in advance and
cannot sort the queue of things to install in a topologically correct
order. It resolves perfectly well \fBif\fR all modules declare the
prerequisites correctly with the \s-1PREREQ_PM\s0 attribute to MakeMaker or
the \f(CW\*(C`requires\*(C'\fR stanza of Module::Build. For bundles which fail and
you need to install often, it is recommended to sort the Bundle
definition file manually.

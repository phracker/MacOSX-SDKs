// Tells the extension to prepare its interface for the requesting context, and request related data items. At this point [(NS|UI)ViewController extensionContext] returns a non-nil value. This message is delivered after initialization, but before the conforming object will be asked to "do something" with the context (i.e. before -[(NS|UI)ViewController loadView]). Subclasses of classes conforming to this protocol are expected to call [super beginRequestWithExtensionContext:] if this method is overridden.

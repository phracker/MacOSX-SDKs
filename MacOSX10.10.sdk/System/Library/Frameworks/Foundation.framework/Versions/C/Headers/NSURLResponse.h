    @abstract An NSURLResponse object represents a URL load response in a
    manner independent of protocol and URL scheme.

    @discussion NSURLResponse encapsulates the metadata associated
    with a URL load. Note that NSURLResponse objects do not contain
    the actual bytes representing the content of a URL. See
    NSURLConnection and NSURLConnectionDelegate for more information
    about receiving the content data for a URL load.

    this method checks the last path component of the URL. If no valid filename can be

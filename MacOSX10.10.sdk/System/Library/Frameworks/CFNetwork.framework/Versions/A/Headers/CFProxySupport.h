	These APIs return arrays of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes a single proxy. 
	The arrays represent the order in which the proxies should be tried - try to download the URL
	using the first entry in the array, and if that fails, try using the second entry, and so on.

	The keys to the proxy dictionaries follow the function declarations; every proxy dictionary 
	will have an entry for kCFProxyTypeKey.  If the type is anything except 
	kCFProxyTypeAutoConfigurationURL, the dictionary will also have entries for the proxy's host
	and port (under kCFProxyHostNameKey and kCFProxyPortNumberKey respectively).  If the type is
	kCFProxyTypeAutoConfigurationURL, it will have an entry for kCFProxyAutoConfigurationURLKey.  
	
	The keys for username and password are optional and will only be present if the username 
	or password could be extracted from the information passed in (i.e. either the URL itself
	or the proxy dictionary supplied).  These APIs do not consult any external credential stores
	(such as the Keychain).

/*! @class IOGatedOutputQueue
    @abstract An extension of an IOBasicOutputQueue. 
    @discussion An IOCommandGate
    object is created by this queue and added to a work loop as an
    event source. All calls to the target by the consumer thread must
    occur with the gate closed. Therefore, all calls to the target of
    this type of queue will be serialized with any other thread that
    runs on the same work loop context. This is useful for network
    drivers that have a tight hardware coupling between the transmit
    and receive engines, and a single-threaded hardware access model
    is desirable.

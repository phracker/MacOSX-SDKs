perl5160delta \- what is new for perl v5.16.0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.14.0 release and
the 5.16.0 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and
5.14.0.
.PP
Some bug fixes in this release have been backported to later
releases of 5.14.x.  Those are indicated with the 5.14.x version in
parentheses.
.SH "Notice"
.IX Header "Notice"
With the release of Perl 5.16.0, the 5.12.x series of releases is now out of
its support period.  There may be future 5.12.x releases, but only in the
event of a critical security issue.  Users of Perl 5.12 or earlier should
consider upgrading to a more recent release of Perl.

.IX Subsection "use VERSION"
As of this release, version declarations like \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR now disable
all features before enabling the new feature bundle.  This means that
the following holds true:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    use 5.016;
\&    # only 5.16 features enabled here
\&    use 5.014;
\&    # only 5.14 features enabled here (not 5.16)
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`use v5.12\*(C'\fR and higher continue to enable strict, but explicit \f(CW\*(C`use
strict\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`no strict\*(C'\fR now override the version declaration, even
when they come first:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    no strict;
\&    use 5.012;
\&    # no strict here
.Ve
.PP
There is a new \*(L":default\*(R" feature bundle that represents the set of
features enabled before any version declaration or \f(CW\*(C`use feature\*(C'\fR has
been seen.  Version declarations below 5.10 now enable the \*(L":default\*(R"
feature set.  This does not actually change the behavior of \f(CW\*(C`use
v5.8\*(C'\fR, because features added to the \*(L":default\*(R" set are those that were
traditionally enabled by default, before they could be turned off.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`no feature\*(C'\fR now resets to the default feature set.  To disable all
features (which is likely to be a pretty special-purpose request, since
it presumably won't match any named set of semantics) you can now  
write \f(CW\*(C`no feature \*(Aq:all\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW$[\fR is now disabled under \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR.  It is part of the default
feature set and can be turned on or off explicitly with \f(CW\*(C`use feature
\&\*(Aqarray_base\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.

The new \f(CW\*(C`_\|_SUB_\|_\*(C'\fR token, available under the \f(CW\*(C`current_sub\*(C'\fR feature
(see feature) or \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR, returns a reference to the current
subroutine, making it easier to write recursive closures.
.SS "New and Improved Built-ins"
.IX Subsection "New and Improved Built-ins"
\fIMore consistent \f(CI\*(C`eval\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "More consistent eval"
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR operator sometimes treats a string argument as a sequence of
characters and sometimes as a sequence of bytes, depending on the
internal encoding.  The internal encoding is not supposed to make any
difference, but there is code that relies on this inconsistency.
.PP
The new \f(CW\*(C`unicode_eval\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`evalbytes\*(C'\fR features (enabled under \f(CW\*(C`use
5.16.0\*(C'\fR) resolve this.  The \f(CW\*(C`unicode_eval\*(C'\fR feature causes \f(CW\*(C`eval
$string\*(C'\fR to treat the string always as Unicode.  The \f(CW\*(C`evalbytes\*(C'\fR
features provides a function, itself called \f(CW\*(C`evalbytes\*(C'\fR, which
evaluates its argument always as a string of bytes.
.PP
These features also fix oddities with source filters leaking to outer
dynamic scopes.
.PP
See feature for more detail.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`substr\*(C'\fI lvalue revamp\fR
.IX Subsection "substr lvalue revamp"
.PP
When \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR is called in lvalue or potential lvalue context with two
or three arguments, a special lvalue scalar is returned that modifies
the original string (the first argument) when assigned to.
.PP
Previously, the offsets (the second and third arguments) passed to
\&\f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR would be converted immediately to match the string, negative
offsets being translated to positive and offsets beyond the end of the
string being truncated.
.PP
Now, the offsets are recorded without modification in the special
lvalue scalar that is returned, and the original string is not even
looked at by \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR itself, but only when the returned lvalue is
read or modified.
.PP
These changes result in an incompatible change:
.PP
If the original string changes length after the call to \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR but
before assignment to its return value, negative offsets will remember
their position from the end of the string, affecting code like this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    my $string = "string";
\&    my $lvalue = \esubstr $string, \-4, 2;
\&    print $$lvalue, "\en"; # prints "ri"
\&    $string = "bailing twine";
\&    print $$lvalue, "\en"; # prints "wi"; used to print "il"
.Ve
.PP
The same thing happens with an omitted third argument.  The returned
lvalue will always extend to the end of the string, even if the string
becomes longer.
.PP
Since this change also allowed many bugs to be fixed (see
"The \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR operator"), and since the behavior
of negative offsets has never been specified, the
change was deemed acceptable.
.PP
\fIReturn value of \f(CI\*(C`tied\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Return value of tied"
.PP
The value returned by \f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR on a tied variable is now the actual
scalar that holds the object to which the variable is tied.  This
lets ties be weakened with \f(CW\*(C`Scalar::Util::weaken(tied
$tied_variable)\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Unicode Support"
.IX Subsection "Unicode Support"
\fISupports (\fIalmost\fI) Unicode 6.1\fR
.IX Subsection "Supports (almost) Unicode 6.1"
.PP
Besides the addition of whole new scripts, and new characters in
existing scripts, this new version of Unicode, as always, makes some
changes to existing characters.  One change that may trip up some
applications is that the General Category of two characters in the
Latin\-1 range, \s-1PILCROW\s0 \s-1SIGN\s0 and \s-1SECTION\s0 \s-1SIGN\s0, has been changed from
Other_Symbol to Other_Punctuation.  The same change has been made for
a character in each of Tibetan, Ethiopic, and Aegean.
The code points U+3248..U+324F (\s-1CIRCLED\s0 \s-1NUMBER\s0 \s-1TEN\s0 \s-1ON\s0 \s-1BLACK\s0 \s-1SQUARE\s0
through \s-1CIRCLED\s0 \s-1NUMBER\s0 \s-1EIGHTY\s0 \s-1ON\s0 \s-1BLACK\s0 \s-1SQUARE\s0) have had their General
Category changed from Other_Symbol to Other_Numeric.  The Line Break
property has changes for Hebrew and Japanese; and because of
other changes in 6.1, the Perl regular expression construct \f(CW\*(C`\eX\*(C'\fR now
works differently for some characters in Thai and Lao.
.PP
New aliases (synonyms) have been defined for many property values;
these, along with the previously existing ones, are all cross-indexed in
perluniprops.
.PP
The return value of \f(CW\*(C`charnames::viacode()\*(C'\fR is affected by other
changes:
.PP
.Vb 10
\& Code point      Old Name             New Name
\&   U+000A    LINE FEED (LF)        LINE FEED
\&   U+000C    FORM FEED (FF)        FORM FEED
\&   U+000D    CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)  CARRIAGE RETURN
\&   U+0085    NEXT LINE (NEL)       NEXT LINE
\&   U+008E    SINGLE\-SHIFT 2        SINGLE\-SHIFT\-2
\&   U+008F    SINGLE\-SHIFT 3        SINGLE\-SHIFT\-3
\&   U+0091    PRIVATE USE 1         PRIVATE USE\-1
\&   U+0092    PRIVATE USE 2         PRIVATE USE\-2
\&   U+2118    SCRIPT CAPITAL P      WEIERSTRASS ELLIPTIC FUNCTION
.Ve
.PP
Perl will accept any of these names as input, but
\&\f(CW\*(C`charnames::viacode()\*(C'\fR now returns the new name of each pair.  The
change for U+2118 is considered by Unicode to be a correction, that is
the original name was a mistake (but again, it will remain forever valid
to use it to refer to U+2118).  But most of these changes are the
fallout of the mistake Unicode 6.0 made in naming a character used in
Japanese cell phones to be \*(L"\s-1BELL\s0\*(R", which conflicts with the longstanding
industry use of (and Unicode's recommendation to use) that name
to mean the \s-1ASCII\s0 control character at U+0007.  Therefore, that name
has been deprecated in Perl since v5.14, and any use of it will raise a
warning message (unless turned off).  The name \*(L"\s-1ALERT\s0\*(R" is now the
preferred name for this code point, with \*(L"\s-1BEL\s0\*(R" an acceptable short
form.  The name for the new cell phone character, at code point U+1F514,
remains undefined in this version of Perl (hence we don't 
implement quite all of Unicode 6.1), but starting in v5.18, \s-1BELL\s0 will mean
this character, and not U+0007.
.PP
Unicode has taken steps to make sure that this sort of mistake does not
happen again.  The Standard now includes all generally accepted
names and abbreviations for control characters, whereas previously it
didn't (though there were recommended names for most of them, which Perl
used).  This means that most of those recommended names are now
officially in the Standard.  Unicode did not recommend names for the
four code points listed above between U+008E and U+008F, and in
standardizing them Unicode subtly changed the names that Perl had
previously given them, by replacing the final blank in each name by a
hyphen.  Unicode also officially accepts names that Perl had deprecated,
such as \s-1FILE\s0 \s-1SEPARATOR\s0.  Now the only deprecated name is \s-1BELL\s0.
Finally, Perl now uses the new official names instead of the old
(now considered obsolete) names for the first four code points in the
list above (the ones which have the parentheses in them).
.PP
Now that the names have been placed in the Unicode standard, these kinds
of changes should not happen again, though corrections, such as to
U+2118, are still possible.
.PP
Unicode also added some name abbreviations, which Perl now accepts:
\&\s-1SP\s0 for \s-1SPACE\s0;
\&\s-1TAB\s0 for \s-1CHARACTER\s0 \s-1TABULATION\s0;
\&\s-1NEW\s0 \s-1LINE\s0, \s-1END\s0 \s-1OF\s0 \s-1LINE\s0, \s-1NL\s0, and \s-1EOL\s0 for \s-1LINE\s0 \s-1FEED\s0;
LOCKING-SHIFT \s-1ONE\s0 for \s-1SHIFT\s0 \s-1OUT\s0;
LOCKING-SHIFT \s-1ZERO\s0 for \s-1SHIFT\s0 \s-1IN\s0;
and \s-1ZWNBSP\s0 for \s-1ZERO\s0 \s-1WIDTH\s0 NO-BREAK \s-1SPACE\s0.
.PP

\fI\f(CI\*(C`use charnames\*(C'\fI is no longer needed for \f(CI\*(C`\eN{\f(CIname\f(CI}\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "use charnames is no longer needed for N{name}"
.PP
When \f(CW\*(C`\eN{\f(CIname\f(CW}\*(C'\fR is encountered, the \f(CW\*(C`charnames\*(C'\fR module is now
automatically loaded when needed as if the \f(CW\*(C`:full\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`:short\*(C'\fR

\&\*(L"Updated Modules and Pragmata\*(R" below.
.PP
\fIUnicode Symbol Names\fR
.IX Subsection "Unicode Symbol Names"
.PP
Perl now has proper support for Unicode in symbol names.  It used to be
that \f(CW\*(C`*{$foo}\*(C'\fR would ignore the internal \s-1UTF8\s0 flag and use the bytes of
the underlying representation to look up the symbol.  That meant that
\&\f(CW\*(C`*{"\ex{100}"}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`*{"\exc4\ex80"}\*(C'\fR would return the same thing.  All
these parts of Perl have been fixed to account for Unicode:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Method names (including those passed to \f(CW\*(C`use overload\*(C'\fR)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Typeglob names (including names of variables, subroutines, and filehandles)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Package names
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4

Second argument to \f(CW\*(C`bless()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`tie()\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4

.IP "\(bu" 4
Subroutine prototypes
.IP "\(bu" 4
Attributes
.IP "\(bu" 4
Various warnings and error messages that mention variable names or values,
methods, etc.
.PP
In addition, a parsing bug has been fixed that prevented \f(CW\*(C`*{e\*'}\*(C'\fR from
implicitly quoting the name, but instead interpreted it as \f(CW\*(C`*{+e\*'}\*(C'\fR, which
would cause a strict violation.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`*{"*a::b"}\*(C'\fR automatically strips off the * if it is followed by an \s-1ASCII\s0
letter.  That has been extended to all Unicode identifier characters.
.PP
One-character non-ASCII non-punctuation variables (like \f(CW\*(C`$e\*'\*(C'\fR) are now
subject to \*(L"Used only once\*(R" warnings.  They used to be exempt, as they
were treated as punctuation variables.
.PP
Also, single-character Unicode punctuation variables (like \f(CW$X\fR) are now
supported [perl #69032].
.PP
\fIImproved ability to mix locales and Unicode, including \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales\fR
.IX Subsection "Improved ability to mix locales and Unicode, including UTF-8 locales"
.PP
An optional parameter has been added to \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
which tells Perl to use all but the \f(CW\*(C`LC_CTYPE\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`LC_COLLATE\*(C'\fR
portions of the current locale.  Instead, the character set is assumed
to be Unicode.  This lets locales and Unicode be seamlessly mixed,
including the increasingly frequent \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales.  When using this
hybrid form of locales, the \f(CW\*(C`:locale\*(C'\fR layer to the open pragma can
be used to interface with the file system, and there are \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
available for \s-1ARGV\s0 and environment variable conversions.

.PP
Unicode foldcase is an extension to lowercase that gives better results
when comparing two strings case-insensitively.  It has long been used
internally in regular expression \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR matching.  Now it is available
explicitly through the new \f(CW\*(C`fc\*(C'\fR function call (enabled by
\&\f(CW"use\ feature\ \*(Aqfc\*(Aq"\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR, or explicitly callable via

the latter meaning was valid only with the \*(L"switch\*(R" feature enabled, and

.SS "Tying scalars that hold typeglobs"
.IX Subsection "Tying scalars that hold typeglobs"
Attempting to tie a scalar after a typeglob was assigned to it would
instead tie the handle in the typeglob's \s-1IO\s0 slot.  This meant that it was
impossible to tie the scalar itself.  Similar problems affected \f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`untie\*(C'\fR: \f(CW\*(C`tied $scalar\*(C'\fR would return false on a tied scalar if the last

would do nothing.
.PP
We fixed this problem before Perl 5.14.0, but it caused problems with some
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 modules, so we put in a deprecation cycle instead.
.PP
Now the deprecation has been removed and this bug has been fixed.  So
\&\f(CW\*(C`tie $scalar\*(C'\fR will always tie the scalar, not the handle it holds.  To tie
the handle, use \f(CW\*(C`tie *$scalar\*(C'\fR (with an explicit asterisk).  The same
applies to \f(CW\*(C`tied *$scalar\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`untie *$scalar\*(C'\fR.

This only impacts users of Linux 2.4 and

majority of Linux installations that use \s-1NPTL\s0 threads.
.PP
This means that \f(CW\*(C`getppid()\*(C'\fR, like \f(CW$$\fR, is now always guaranteed to
return the \s-1OS\s0's idea of the current state of the process, not perl's
cached version of it.

When we cached these values our idea of what they were would drift out

this complexity wasn't worth it given how cheap the \f(CW\*(C`gete?[ug]id()\*(C'\fR

.PP
The fix for those breakages is to use \f(CW\*(C`PerlProc_gete?[ug]id()\*(C'\fR to
retrieve them (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`PerlProc_getuid()\*(C'\fR), and not to assign to
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_e?[ug]id\*(C'\fR if you change the \s-1UID/GID/EUID/EGID\s0.  There is no longer
any need to do so since perl will always retrieve the up-to-date

Improved performance for Unicode properties in regular expressions
.Sp
Matching a code point against a Unicode property is now done via a
binary search instead of linear.  This means for example that the worst
case for a 1000 item property is 10 probes instead of 1000.  This
inefficiency has been compensated for in the past by permanently storing
in a hash the results of a given probe plus the results for the adjacent
64 code points, under the theory that near-by code points are likely to
be searched for.  A separate hash was used for each mention of a Unicode
property in each regular expression.  Thus, \f(CW\*(C`qr/\ep{foo}abc\ep{foo}/\*(C'\fR
would generate two hashes.  Any probes in one instance would be unknown
to the other, and the hashes could expand separately to be quite large
if the regular expression were used on many different widely-separated
code points.
Now, however, there is just one hash shared by all instances of a given
property.  This means that if \f(CW\*(C`\ep{foo}\*(C'\fR is matched against \*(L"A\*(R" in one
regular expression in a thread, the result will be known immediately to
all regular expressions, and the relentless march of using up memory is
slowed considerably.

Version declarations with the \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR keyword (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`use 5.012\*(C'\fR) are now
faster, as they enable features without loading \fIfeature.pm\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`local $_\*(C'\fR is faster now, as it no longer iterates through magic that it
is not going to copy anyway.

Perl 5.12.0 sped up the destruction of objects whose classes define
empty \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR methods (to prevent autoloading), by simply not
calling such empty methods.  This release takes this optimization a
step further, by not calling any \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR method that begins with a
\&\f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement.  This can be useful for destructors that are only
used for debugging:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use constant DEBUG => 1;
\&    sub DESTROY { return unless DEBUG; ... }
.Ve
.Sp
Constant-folding will reduce the first statement to \f(CW\*(C`return;\*(C'\fR if \s-1DEBUG\s0
is set to 0, triggering this optimization.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning to a variable that holds a typeglob or copy-on-write scalar
is now much faster.  Previously the typeglob would be stringified or
the copy-on-write scalar would be copied before being clobbered.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assignment to \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR in void context is now more than twice its
previous speed.  Instead of creating and returning a special lvalue
scalar that is then assigned to, \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR modifies the original string
itself.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR no longer calculates a value to return when called in void
context.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Due to changes in File::Glob, Perl's \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR function and its \f(CW\*(C`<...>\*(C'\fR equivalent are now much faster.  The splitting of the pattern
into words has been rewritten in C, resulting in speed-ups of 20% for
some cases.
.Sp
This does not affect \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR on \s-1VMS\s0, as it does not use File::Glob.

The short-circuiting operators \f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR, when chained

due to reduced optree traversal.

The implementation of \f(CW\*(C`s///r\*(C'\fR makes one fewer copy of the scalar's value.

Things that may break your code:
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`url()\*(C'\fR was fixed to return \f(CW\*(C`PATH_INFO\*(C'\fR when it is explicitly requested
with either the \f(CW\*(C`path=>1\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`path_info=>1\*(C'\fR flag.
.Sp
If your code is running under mod_rewrite (or compatible) and you are
calling \f(CW\*(C`self_url()\*(C'\fR or you are calling \f(CW\*(C`url()\*(C'\fR and passing
\&\f(CW\*(C`path_info=>1\*(C'\fR, these methods will actually be returning
\&\f(CW\*(C`PATH_INFO\*(C'\fR now, as you have explicitly requested or \f(CW\*(C`self_url()\*(C'\fR
has requested on your behalf.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`PATH_INFO\*(C'\fR has been omitted in such URLs since the issue was
introduced in the 3.12 release in December, 2005.
.Sp
This bug is so old your application may have come to depend on it or
workaround it. Check for application before upgrading to this release.

.Sp
We no longer read from \s-1STDIN\s0 when the Content-Length is not set,
preventing requests with no Content-Length from sometimes freezing.
This is consistent with the \s-1CGI\s0 \s-1RFC\s0 3875, and is also consistent with
CGI::Simple.  However, the old behavior may have been expected by some
command-line uses of \s-1CGI\s0.pm.

.Sp
It has a new \f(CW\*(C`:bsd_glob\*(C'\fR export tag, intended to replace \f(CW\*(C`:glob\*(C'\fR.  Like
\&\f(CW\*(C`:glob\*(C'\fR it overrides \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR with a function that does not split the glob
pattern into words, but, unlike \f(CW\*(C`:glob\*(C'\fR, it iterates properly in scalar
context, instead of returning the last file.
.Sp
There are other changes affecting Perl's own \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR operator (which uses

\&\s-1IO\s0 has been upgraded from version 1.25_04 to 1.25_06, and IO::Handle

.Sp
Together, these upgrades fix a problem with IO::Handle's \f(CW\*(C`getline\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`getlines\*(C'\fR methods.  When these methods are called on the special \s-1ARGV\s0
handle, the next file is automatically opened, as happens with the built-in
\&\f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`readline\*(C'\fR functions.  But, unlike the built-ins, these
methods were not respecting the caller's use of the open pragma and
applying the appropriate I/O layers to the newly-opened file
[rt.cpan.org #66474].

Reorganized modules to move Locale::MODULE to Locale::Codes::MODULE to allow

Locale::Currency, Locale::Country, Locale::Script) will continue to work, but
all new sets of codes will be added in the Locale::Codes namespace.
.Sp
The code2XXX, XXX2code, all_XXX_codes, and all_XXX_names functions now
support retired codes.  All codesets may be specified by a constant or
by their name now.  Previously, they were specified only by a constant.

The alias_code function exists for backward compatibility.  It has been
replaced by rename_country_code.  The alias_code function will be
removed some time after September, 2013.
.Sp
All work is now done in the central module (Locale::Codes).  Previously,
some was still done in the wrapper modules (Locale::Codes::*).  Added

another means to determine whether the object has overloading.  It was
never correct for it to call \f(CW\*(C`can\*(C'\fR, as overloading does not respect
\&\s-1AUTOLOAD\s0.  So classes that autoload methods and implement \f(CW\*(C`can\*(C'\fR no longer

It no longer assumes during \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR that \f(CW$scalar\fR is a string internally.
If it didn't crash, it was close to doing so [perl #92706].  Also, the
internal print routine no longer assumes that the position set by \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR

bytes (between the old length and the seek position) with nulls
[perl #78980].
.Sp
Printing to an in-memory handle now works if the \f(CW$scalar\fR holds a reference,
stringifying the reference before modifying it.  References used to be
treated as empty strings.
.Sp
Printing to an in-memory handle no longer crashes if the \f(CW$scalar\fR happens to

\&\s-1POSIX\s0 no longer uses AutoLoader.  Any code which was relying on this

The module's Perl code has been considerably simplified, roughly halving
the number of lines, with no change in functionality.  The \s-1XS\s0 code has
been refactored to reduce the size of the shared object by about 12%,
with no change in functionality.  More \s-1POSIX\s0 functions now have tests.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`sigsuspend\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`pause\*(C'\fR now run signal handlers before returning, as the
whole point of these two functions is to wait until a signal has
arrived, and then return \fIafter\fR it has been triggered.  Delayed, or
\&\*(L"safe\*(R", signals were preventing that from happening, possibly resulting in
race conditions [perl #107216].
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`POSIX::sleep\*(C'\fR is now a direct call into the underlying \s-1OS\s0 \f(CW\*(C`sleep\*(C'\fR

Warnings that mention the names of lexical (\f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR) variables with
Unicode characters in them now respect the presence or absence of the

Padlists are now marked \f(CW\*(C`AvREAL\*(C'\fR; i.e., reference-counted.  They have

Perl now checks whether the array (the linearized isa) returned by a \s-1MRO\s0

Copy-on-write or shared hash key scalars

5.10.0 extended them, such that assigning \f(CW\*(C`_\|_PACKAGE_\|_\*(C'\fR or a

The \f(CW\*(C`#line 42 foo\*(C'\fR directive used not to update the arrays of lines used

it works for multiple.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When subroutine calls are intercepted by the debugger, the name of the

to access.  Sometimes (such as \f(CW\*(C`$foo = *bar; undef *bar; &$foo\*(C'\fR)
\&\f(CW$DB::sub\fR would be set to a name that could not be used to find the
subroutine, and so the debugger's attempt to call it would fail.  Now the
check to see whether a reference is needed is more robust, so those
problems should not happen anymore [rt.cpan.org #69862].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Every subroutine has a filename associated with it that the debugger uses.

Perl 5.10.0 introduced a similar bug: \f(CW\*(C`defined(*{"foo"})\*(C'\fR where \*(L"foo\*(R"

Since 5.6.0, \f(CW\*(C`*{ ... }\*(C'\fR has been inconsistent in how it treats undefined

.SS "Filehandle, last-accessed"
.IX Subsection "Filehandle, last-accessed"
Perl has an internal variable that stores the last filehandle to be
accessed.  It is used by \f(CW$.\fR and by \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eof\*(C'\fR without
arguments.
.IP "\(bu" 4
It used to be possible to set this internal variable to a glob copy and
then modify that glob copy to be something other than a glob, and still
have the last-accessed filehandle associated with the variable after
assigning a glob to it again:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    my $foo = *STDOUT;  # $foo is a glob copy
\&    <$foo>;             # $foo is now the last\-accessed handle
\&    $foo = 3;           # no longer a glob
\&    $foo = *STDERR;     # still the last\-accessed handle
.Ve
.Sp
Now the \f(CW\*(C`$foo = 3\*(C'\fR assignment unsets that internal variable, so there
is no last-accessed filehandle, just as if \f(CW\*(C`<$foo>\*(C'\fR had never
happened.
.Sp
This also prevents some unrelated handle from becoming the last-accessed
handle if \f(CW$foo\fR falls out of scope and the same internal \s-1SV\s0 gets used for
another handle [perl #97988].
.IP "\(bu" 4
A regression in 5.14 caused these statements not to set that internal

This is now fixed, but \f(CW\*(C`tell *{ *$fh }\*(C'\fR still has the problem, and it

\&\f(CW\*(C`("string", $variable) ||= 1\*(C'\fR (which used to be an error).  Since the
left-hand side of \f(CW\*(C`||=\*(C'\fR is evaluated in scalar context, that's a scalar
comma operator, which gives all but the last item void context.  There is
no such thing as void lvalue context, so it was a mistake for Perl to try
to force it [perl #96942].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR no longer leaks memory when called from the \s-1DB\s0 package if
\&\f(CW@DB::args\fR was assigned to after the first call to \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR.  Carp
was triggering this bug [perl #97010]. (5.14.2)
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR and similar filehandle functions, when called on built-in global
variables (like \f(CW$+\fR), used to die if the variable happened to hold the
undefined value, instead of producing the usual \*(L"Use of uninitialized
value\*(R" warning.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When autovivified file handles were introduced in Perl 5.6.0, \f(CW\*(C`readline\*(C'\fR
was inadvertently made to autovivify when called as \f(CW\*(C`readline($foo)\*(C'\fR (but
not as \f(CW\*(C`<$foo>\*(C'\fR).  It has now been fixed never to autovivify.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Calling an undefined anonymous subroutine (e.g., what \f(CW$x\fR holds after
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef &{$x = sub{}}\*(C'\fR) used to cause a \*(L"Not a \s-1CODE\s0 reference\*(R" error, which
has been corrected to \*(L"Undefined subroutine called\*(R" [perl #71154].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Causing \f(CW@DB::args\fR to be freed between uses of \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR no longer
results in a crash [perl #93320].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`setpgrp($foo)\*(C'\fR used to be equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`($foo, setpgrp)\*(C'\fR, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`setpgrp\*(C'\fR was ignoring its argument if there was just one.  Now it is
equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`setpgrp($foo,0)\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`shmread\*(C'\fR was not setting the scalar flags correctly when reading from
shared memory, causing the existing cached numeric representation in the
scalar to persist [perl #98480].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR now work on copies of globs, instead of dying.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`splice()\*(C'\fR doesn't warn when truncating
.Sp
You can now limit the size of an array using \f(CW\*(C`splice(@a,MAX_LEN)\*(C'\fR without
worrying about warnings.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$$\fR is no longer tainted.  Since this value comes directly from
\&\f(CW\*(C`getpid()\*(C'\fR, it is always safe.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The parser no longer leaks a filehandle if \s-1STDIN\s0 was closed before parsing
started [perl #37033].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`die;\*(C'\fR with a non-reference, non-string, or magical (e.g., tainted)
value in $@ now properly propagates that value [perl #111654].

On Solaris, we have two kinds of failure.
.Sp
If \fImake\fR is Sun's \fImake\fR, we get an error about a badly formed macro
assignment in the \fIMakefile\fR.  That happens when \fI./Configure\fR tries to
make depends.  \fIConfigure\fR then exits 0, but further \fImake\fR\-ing fails.
.Sp
If \fImake\fR is \fIgmake\fR, \fIConfigure\fR completes, then we get errors related
to \fI/usr/include/stdbool.h\fR

On Win32, a number of tests hang unless \s-1STDERR\s0 is redirected.  The cause of
this is still under investigation.

When building as root with a umask that prevents files from being
other-readable, \fIt/op/filetest.t\fR will fail.  This is a test bug, not a
bug in perl's behavior.

Configuring with a recent gcc and link-time-optimization, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`Configure \-Doptimize=\*(Aq\-O2 \-flto\*(Aq\*(C'\fR fails
because the optimizer optimizes away some of Configure's tests.  A
workaround is to omit the \f(CW\*(C`\-flto\*(C'\fR flag when running Configure, but add
it back in while actually building, something like
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    sh Configure \-Doptimize=\-O2

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0
modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0
community for helping Perl to flourish.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at <http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/>.  There may also be
information at <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
send it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all core
committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure
out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is
supported.  Please use this address only for security issues in the Perl
core, not for modules independently distributed on \s-1CPAN\s0.

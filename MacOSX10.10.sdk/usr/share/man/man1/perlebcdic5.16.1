perlebcdic \- Considerations for running Perl on EBCDIC platforms
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
An exploration of some of the issues facing Perl programmers
on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 based computers.  We do not cover localization, 
internationalization, or multi-byte character set issues other
than some discussion of \s-1UTF\-8\s0 and UTF-EBCDIC.
.PP
Portions that are still incomplete are marked with \s-1XXX\s0.
.PP
Perl used to work on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 machines, but there are now areas of the code where
it doesn't.  If you want to use Perl on an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 machine, please let us know
by sending mail to perlbug@perl.org
.SH "COMMON CHARACTER CODE SETS"
.IX Header "COMMON CHARACTER CODE SETS"
.SS "\s-1ASCII\s0"
.IX Subsection "ASCII"
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (\s-1ASCII\s0 or US-ASCII) is a
set of
integers running from 0 to 127 (decimal) that imply character 
interpretation by the display and other systems of computers.  
The range 0..127 can be covered by setting the bits in a 7\-bit binary 
digit, hence the set is sometimes referred to as \*(L"7\-bit \s-1ASCII\s0\*(R".  
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 was described by the American National Standards Institute 
document \s-1ANSI\s0 X3.4\-1986.  It was also described by \s-1ISO\s0 646:1991 
(with localization for currency symbols).  The full \s-1ASCII\s0 set is 
given in the table below as the first 128 elements.  Languages that 
can be written adequately with the characters in \s-1ASCII\s0 include 
English, Hawaiian, Indonesian, Swahili and some Native American 
languages.
.PP
There are many character sets that extend the range of integers
from 0..2**7\-1 up to 2**8\-1, or 8 bit bytes (octets if you prefer).
One common one is the \s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1 character set.
.SS "\s-1ISO\s0 8859"
.IX Subsection "ISO 8859"
The \s-1ISO\s0 8859\-$n are a collection of character code sets from the 
International Organization for Standardization (\s-1ISO\s0) each of which 
adds characters to the \s-1ASCII\s0 set that are typically found in European 
languages many of which are based on the Roman, or Latin, alphabet.
.SS "Latin 1 (\s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1)"
.IX Subsection "Latin 1 (ISO 8859-1)"
A particular 8\-bit extension to \s-1ASCII\s0 that includes grave and acute 
accented Latin characters.  Languages that can employ \s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1 
include all the languages covered by \s-1ASCII\s0 as well as Afrikaans, 
Albanian, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Faroese, Finnish, Norwegian, 
Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.  Dutch is covered albeit without 
the ij ligature.  French is covered too but without the oe ligature. 
German can use \s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1 but must do so without German-style
quotation marks.  This set is based on Western European extensions 
to \s-1ASCII\s0 and is commonly encountered in world wide web work.
In \s-1IBM\s0 character code set identification terminology \s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1 is
also known as \s-1CCSID\s0 819 (or sometimes 0819 or even 00819).
.SS "\s-1EBCDIC\s0"
.IX Subsection "EBCDIC"
The Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code refers to a 
large collection of single\- and multi-byte coded character sets that are
different from \s-1ASCII\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1 and are all slightly different from each
other; they typically run on host computers.  The \s-1EBCDIC\s0 encodings derive from
8\-bit byte extensions of Hollerith punched card encodings.  The layout on the
cards was such that high bits were set for the upper and lower case alphabet
characters [a\-z] and [A\-Z], but there were gaps within each Latin alphabet
range.
.PP
Some \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character sets may be known by character code set 
identification numbers (\s-1CCSID\s0 numbers) or code page numbers.
.PP
Perl can be compiled on platforms that run any of three commonly used \s-1EBCDIC\s0
character sets, listed below.
.SS "The 13 variant characters"
.IX Subsection "The 13 variant characters"
Among \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character code sets there are 13 characters that
are often mapped to different integer values.  Those characters
are known as the 13 \*(L"variant\*(R" characters and are:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \e [ ] { } ^ ~ ! # | $ @ \`
.Ve
.PP
When Perl is compiled for a platform, it looks at some of these characters to
guess which \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character set the platform uses, and adapts itself
accordingly to that platform.  If the platform uses a character set that is not
one of the three Perl knows about, Perl will either fail to compile, or
mistakenly and silently choose one of the three.
They are:
.SS "0037"
.IX Subsection "0037"
Character code set \s-1ID\s0 0037 is a mapping of the \s-1ASCII\s0 plus Latin\-1 
characters (i.e. \s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1) to an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 set.  0037 is used 
in North American English locales on the \s-1OS/400\s0 operating system 
that runs on \s-1AS/400\s0 computers.  \s-1CCSID\s0 0037 differs from \s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1 
in 237 places, in other words they agree on only 19 code point values.
.SS "1047"
.IX Subsection "1047"
Character code set \s-1ID\s0 1047 is also a mapping of the \s-1ASCII\s0 plus 
Latin\-1 characters (i.e. \s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1) to an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 set.  1047 is 
used under Unix System Services for \s-1OS/390\s0 or z/OS, and OpenEdition 
for \s-1VM/ESA\s0.  \s-1CCSID\s0 1047 differs from \s-1CCSID\s0 0037 in eight places.
.SS "POSIX-BC"
.IX Subsection "POSIX-BC"
The \s-1EBCDIC\s0 code page in use on Siemens' \s-1BS2000\s0 system is distinct from
1047 and 0037.  It is identified below as the POSIX-BC set.
.SS "Unicode code points versus \s-1EBCDIC\s0 code points"
.IX Subsection "Unicode code points versus EBCDIC code points"
In Unicode terminology a \fIcode point\fR is the number assigned to a
character: for example, in \s-1EBCDIC\s0 the character \*(L"A\*(R" is usually assigned
the number 193.  In Unicode the character \*(L"A\*(R" is assigned the number 65.
This causes a problem with the semantics of the pack/unpack \*(L"U\*(R", which
are supposed to pack Unicode code points to characters and back to numbers.
The problem is: which code points to use for code points less than 256?
(for 256 and over there's no problem: Unicode code points are used)
In \s-1EBCDIC\s0, for the low 256 the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 code points are used.  This
means that the equivalences
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    pack("U", ord($character)) eq $character
\&    unpack("U", $character) == ord $character
.Ve
.PP
will hold.  (If Unicode code points were applied consistently over
all the possible code points, pack(\*(L"U\*(R",ord(\*(L"A\*(R")) would in \s-1EBCDIC\s0
equal \fIA with acute\fR or chr(101), and unpack(\*(L"U\*(R", \*(L"A\*(R") would equal
65, or \fInon-breaking space\fR, not 193, or ord \*(L"A\*(R".)
.SS "Remaining Perl Unicode problems in \s-1EBCDIC\s0"
.IX Subsection "Remaining Perl Unicode problems in EBCDIC"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Many of the remaining problems seem to be related to case-insensitive matching
.IP "\(bu" 4
The extensions Unicode::Collate and Unicode::Normalized are not
supported under \s-1EBCDIC\s0, likewise for the encoding pragma.
.SS "Unicode and \s-1UTF\s0"
.IX Subsection "Unicode and UTF"
\&\s-1UTF\s0 stands for \f(CW\*(C`Unicode Transformation Format\*(C'\fR.
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 is an encoding of Unicode into a sequence of 8\-bit byte chunks, based on
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 and Latin\-1.
The length of a sequence required to represent a Unicode code point
depends on the ordinal number of that code point,
with larger numbers requiring more bytes.
UTF-EBCDIC is like \s-1UTF\-8\s0, but based on \s-1EBCDIC\s0.
.PP
You may see the term \f(CW\*(C`invariant\*(C'\fR character or code point.
This simply means that the character has the same numeric
value when encoded as when not.
(Note that this is a very different concept from \*(L"The 13 variant characters\*(R"
mentioned above.)
For example, the ordinal value of 'A' is 193 in most \s-1EBCDIC\s0 code pages,
and also is 193 when encoded in UTF-EBCDIC.
All variant code points occupy at least two bytes when encoded.
In \s-1UTF\-8\s0, the code points corresponding to the lowest 128
ordinal numbers (0 \- 127: the \s-1ASCII\s0 characters) are invariant.
In UTF-EBCDIC, there are 160 invariant characters.
(If you care, the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 invariants are those characters
which have \s-1ASCII\s0 equivalents, plus those that correspond to
the C1 controls (80..9f on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms).)
.PP
A string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may be longer (but never shorter) than
one encoded in \s-1UTF\-8\s0.
.SS "Using Encode"
.IX Subsection "Using Encode"
Starting from Perl 5.8 you can use the standard new module Encode
to translate from \s-1EBCDIC\s0 to Latin\-1 code points.
Encode knows about more \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character sets than Perl can currently
be compiled to run on.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use Encode \*(Aqfrom_to\*(Aq;
\&
\&   my %ebcdic = ( 176 => \*(Aqcp37\*(Aq, 95 => \*(Aqcp1047\*(Aq, 106 => \*(Aqposix\-bc\*(Aq );
\&
\&   # $a is in EBCDIC code points
\&   from_to($a, $ebcdic{ord \*(Aq^\*(Aq}, \*(Aqlatin1\*(Aq);
\&   # $a is ISO 8859\-1 code points
.Ve
.PP
and from Latin\-1 code points to \s-1EBCDIC\s0 code points
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use Encode \*(Aqfrom_to\*(Aq;
\&
\&   my %ebcdic = ( 176 => \*(Aqcp37\*(Aq, 95 => \*(Aqcp1047\*(Aq, 106 => \*(Aqposix\-bc\*(Aq );
\&
\&   # $a is ISO 8859\-1 code points
\&   from_to($a, \*(Aqlatin1\*(Aq, $ebcdic{ord \*(Aq^\*(Aq});
\&   # $a is in EBCDIC code points
.Ve
.PP
For doing I/O it is suggested that you use the autotranslating features
of PerlIO, see perluniintro.
.PP
Since version 5.8 Perl uses the new PerlIO I/O library.  This enables
you to use different encodings per \s-1IO\s0 channel.  For example you may use
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    use Encode;
\&    open($f, ">:encoding(ascii)", "test.ascii");
\&    print $f "Hello World!\en";
\&    open($f, ">:encoding(cp37)", "test.ebcdic");
\&    print $f "Hello World!\en";
\&    open($f, ">:encoding(latin1)", "test.latin1");
\&    print $f "Hello World!\en";
\&    open($f, ">:encoding(utf8)", "test.utf8");
\&    print $f "Hello World!\en";
.Ve
.PP
to get four files containing \*(L"Hello World!\en\*(R" in \s-1ASCII\s0, \s-1CP\s0 0037 \s-1EBCDIC\s0,
\&\s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1 (Latin\-1) (in this example identical to \s-1ASCII\s0 since only \s-1ASCII\s0
characters were printed), and 
UTF-EBCDIC (in this example identical to normal \s-1EBCDIC\s0 since only characters
that don't differ between \s-1EBCDIC\s0 and UTF-EBCDIC were printed).  See the
documentation of Encode::PerlIO for details.
.PP
As the PerlIO layer uses raw \s-1IO\s0 (bytes) internally, all this totally
ignores things like the type of your filesystem (\s-1ASCII\s0 or \s-1EBCDIC\s0).
.SH "SINGLE OCTET TABLES"
.IX Header "SINGLE OCTET TABLES"
The following tables list the \s-1ASCII\s0 and Latin 1 ordered sets including
the subsets: C0 controls (0..31), \s-1ASCII\s0 graphics (32..7e), delete (7f),
C1 controls (80..9f), and Latin\-1 (a.k.a. \s-1ISO\s0 8859\-1) (a0..ff).  In the 
table non-printing control character names as well as the Latin 1 
extensions to \s-1ASCII\s0 have been labelled with character names roughly 
corresponding to \fIThe Unicode Standard, Version 3.0\fR albeit with 
substitutions such as s/LATIN// and s/VULGAR// in all cases, 
s/CAPITAL \s-1LETTER//\s0 in some cases, and s/SMALL \s-1LETTER\s0 ([A\-Z])/\el$1/ 
in some other cases.  The \*(L"names\*(R" of the controls listed here are 
the Unicode Version 1 names, except for the few that don't have names, in which
case the names in the Wikipedia article were used

.SH "IDENTIFYING CHARACTER CODE SETS"
.IX Header "IDENTIFYING CHARACTER CODE SETS"
To determine the character set you are running under from perl one 
could use the return value of \fIord()\fR or \fIchr()\fR to test one or more 
character values.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $is_ascii  = "A" eq chr(65);
\&    $is_ebcdic = "A" eq chr(193);
.Ve
.PP
Also, \*(L"\et\*(R" is a \f(CW\*(C`HORIZONTAL TABULATION\*(C'\fR character so that:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $is_ascii  = ord("\et") == 9;
\&    $is_ebcdic = ord("\et") == 5;
.Ve
.PP
To distinguish \s-1EBCDIC\s0 code pages try looking at one or more of
the characters that differ between them.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $is_ebcdic_37   = "\en" eq chr(37);
\&    $is_ebcdic_1047 = "\en" eq chr(21);
.Ve
.PP
Or better still choose a character that is uniquely encoded in any
of the code sets, e.g.:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $is_ascii           = ord(\*(Aq[\*(Aq) == 91;
\&    $is_ebcdic_37       = ord(\*(Aq[\*(Aq) == 186;
\&    $is_ebcdic_1047     = ord(\*(Aq[\*(Aq) == 173;
\&    $is_ebcdic_POSIX_BC = ord(\*(Aq[\*(Aq) == 187;
.Ve
.PP
However, it would be unwise to write tests such as:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $is_ascii = "\er" ne chr(13);  #  WRONG
\&    $is_ascii = "\en" ne chr(10);  #  ILL ADVISED
.Ve
.PP
Obviously the first of these will fail to distinguish most \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms
from either a \s-1CCSID\s0 0037, a 1047, or a POSIX-BC \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform since \*(L"\er\*(R" eq 
chr(13) under all of those coded character sets.  But note too that 
because \*(L"\en\*(R" is chr(13) and \*(L"\er\*(R" is chr(10) on the Macintosh (which is an

.SS "tr///"
.IX Subsection "tr///"
In order to convert a string of characters from one character set to 
another a simple list of numbers, such as in the right columns in the
above table, along with perl's tr/// operator is all that is needed.  
The data in the table are in ASCII/Latin1 order, hence the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 columns
provide easy-to-use ASCII/Latin1 to \s-1EBCDIC\s0 operations that are also easily 
reversed.
.PP
For example, to convert ASCII/Latin1 to code page 037 take the output of the
second numbers column from the output of recipe 2 (modified to add '\e'
characters) and use it in tr/// like so:
.PP

To convert from \s-1EBCDIC\s0 037 to \s-1ASCII\s0 just reverse the order of the tr///

.PP
Similarly one could take the output of the third numbers column from recipe 2
to obtain a \f(CW$cp_1047\fR table.  The fourth numbers column of the output from
recipe 2 could provide a \f(CW$cp_posix_bc\fR table suitable for transcoding as
well.
.PP
If you wanted to see the inverse tables, you would first have to sort on the
desired numbers column as in recipes 4, 5 or 6, then take the output of the
first numbers column.

The \f(CW\*(C`..\*(C'\fR range operator treats certain character ranges with 
care on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.  For example the following array
will have twenty six elements on either an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform
or an \s-1ASCII\s0 platform:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @alphabet = (\*(AqA\*(Aq..\*(AqZ\*(Aq);   #  $#alphabet == 25
.Ve
.PP
The bitwise operators such as & ^ | may return different results
when operating on string or character data in a perl program running 
on an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform than when run on an \s-1ASCII\s0 platform.  Here is
an example adapted from the one in perlop:
.PP
.Vb 5

\&    print "j p \en" ^ " a h";                      # prints "JAPH\en"

.Ve
.PP
An interesting property of the 32 C0 control characters
in the \s-1ASCII\s0 table is that they can \*(L"literally\*(R" be constructed
as control characters in perl, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`(chr(0)\*(C'\fR eq \f(CW\*(C`\ec@\*(C'\fR)>
\&\f(CW\*(C`(chr(1)\*(C'\fR eq \f(CW\*(C`\ecA\*(C'\fR)>, and so on.  Perl on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms has been
ported to take \f(CW\*(C`\ec@\*(C'\fR to \fIchr\fR\|(0) and \f(CW\*(C`\ecA\*(C'\fR to \fIchr\fR\|(1), etc. as well, but the
thirty three characters that result depend on which code page you are
using.  The table below uses the standard acronyms for the controls.
The POSIX-BC and 1047 sets are
identical throughout this range and differ from the 0037 set at only 
one spot (21 decimal).  Note that the \f(CW\*(C`LINE FEED\*(C'\fR character
may be generated by \f(CW\*(C`\ecJ\*(C'\fR on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms but by \f(CW\*(C`\ecU\*(C'\fR on 1047 or POSIX-BC 
platforms and cannot be generated as a \f(CW"\ec.letter."\fR control character on 
0037 platforms.  Note also that \f(CW\*(C`\ec\e\*(C'\fR cannot be the final element in a string
or regex, as it will absorb the terminator.   But \f(CW\*(C`\ec\e\f(CIX\f(CW\*(C'\fR is a \f(CW\*(C`FILE
SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR concatenated with \fIX\fR for all \fIX\fR.

.IP "\fIprint()\fR" 8
.IX Item "print()"
One must be careful with scalars and strings that are passed to
print that contain \s-1ASCII\s0 encodings.  One common place
for this to occur is in the output of the \s-1MIME\s0 type header for
\&\s-1CGI\s0 script writing.  For example, many perl programming guides 
recommend something similar to:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    print "Content\-type:\ettext/html\e015\e012\e015\e012"; 
\&    # this may be wrong on EBCDIC
.Ve
.Sp
Under the \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1OS/390\s0 \s-1USS\s0 Web Server or WebSphere on z/OS for example 
you should instead write that as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print "Content\-type:\ettext/html\er\en\er\en"; # OK for DGW et al
.Ve
.Sp
That is because the translation from \s-1EBCDIC\s0 to \s-1ASCII\s0 is done
by the web server in this case (such code will not be appropriate for
the Macintosh however).  Consult your web server's documentation for 
further details.

.SH "REGULAR EXPRESSION DIFFERENCES"
.IX Header "REGULAR EXPRESSION DIFFERENCES"
As of perl 5.005_03 the letter range regular expressions such as 
[A\-Z] and [a\-z] have been especially coded to not pick up gap 
characters.  For example, characters such as o\*^ \f(CW\*(C`o WITH CIRCUMFLEX\*(C'\fR 
that lie between I and J would not be matched by the 
regular expression range \f(CW\*(C`/[H\-K]/\*(C'\fR.  This works in
the other direction, too, if either of the range end points is
explicitly numeric: \f(CW\*(C`[\ex89\-\ex91]\*(C'\fR will match \f(CW\*(C`\ex8e\*(C'\fR, even
though \f(CW\*(C`\ex89\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\ex91 \*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`j\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`\ex8e\*(C'\fR
is a gap character from the alphabetic viewpoint.
.PP
If you do want to match the alphabet gap characters in a single octet 
regular expression try matching the hex or octal code such 
as \f(CW\*(C`/\e313/\*(C'\fR on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 or \f(CW\*(C`/\e364/\*(C'\fR on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms to 
have your regular expression match \f(CW\*(C`o WITH CIRCUMFLEX\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Another construct to be wary of is the inappropriate use of hex or
octal constants in regular expressions.  Consider the following
set of subs:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub is_c0 {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\e000\-\e037]/;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_print_ascii {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\e040\-\e176]/;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_delete {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char eq "\e177";
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_c1 {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\e200\-\e237]/;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub is_latin_1 {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\e240\-\e377]/;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The above would be adequate if the concern was only with numeric code points.
However, the concern may be with characters rather than code points 
and on an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform it may be desirable for constructs such as 
\&\f(CW\*(C`if (is_print_ascii("A")) {print "A is a printable character\en";}\*(C'\fR to print
out the expected message.  One way to represent the above collection

Note however that only the \f(CW\*(C`Is_ascii_print()\*(C'\fR sub is really independent 
of coded character set.  Another way to write \f(CW\*(C`Is_latin_1()\*(C'\fR would be 
to use the characters in the range explicitly:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub Is_latin_1 {
\&        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
\&        $char =~ /[\ XXXXXXXXXXXX\%XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXA\*`A\*'A\*^A\*~A\*:A\*o\*(AEC\*,E\*`E\*'E\*^E\*:I\*`I\*'I\*^I\*:\*(D-N\*~O\*`O\*'O\*^O\*~O\*:XO\*/U\*`U\*'U\*^U\*:Y\*'\*(Th\*8a\*`a\*'a\*^a\*~a\*:a\*o\*(aec\*,e\*`e\*'e\*^e\*:i\*`i\*'i\*^i\*:\*(d-n\*~o\*`o\*'o\*^o\*~o\*:Xo\*/u\*`u\*'u\*^u\*:y\*'\*(thy\*:]/;

.Ve
.PP
Although that form may run into trouble in network transit (due to the 
presence of 8 bit characters) or on non ISO-Latin character sets.
.SH "SOCKETS"
.IX Header "SOCKETS"
Most socket programming assumes \s-1ASCII\s0 character encodings in network
byte order.  Exceptions can include \s-1CGI\s0 script writing under a
host web server where the server may take care of translation for you.
Most host web servers convert \s-1EBCDIC\s0 data to \s-1ISO\-8859\-1\s0 or Unicode on
output.
.SH "SORTING"
.IX Header "SORTING"
One big difference between ASCII-based character sets and \s-1EBCDIC\s0 ones
are the relative positions of upper and lower case letters and the
letters compared to the digits.  If sorted on an ASCII-based platform the
two-letter abbreviation for a physician comes before the two letter
abbreviation for drive; that is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& @sorted = sort(qw(Dr. dr.));  # @sorted holds (\*(AqDr.\*(Aq,\*(Aqdr.\*(Aq) on ASCII,
\&                                  # but (\*(Aqdr.\*(Aq,\*(AqDr.\*(Aq) on EBCDIC
.Ve
.PP
The property of lowercase before uppercase letters in \s-1EBCDIC\s0 is
even carried to the Latin 1 \s-1EBCDIC\s0 pages such as 0037 and 1047.
An example would be that E\*: \f(CW\*(C`E WITH DIAERESIS\*(C'\fR (203) comes 
before e\*: \f(CW\*(C`e WITH DIAERESIS\*(C'\fR (235) on an \s-1ASCII\s0 platform, but 
the latter (83) comes before the former (115) on an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform.  
(Astute readers will note that the uppercase version of \*8 
\&\f(CW\*(C`SMALL LETTER SHARP S\*(C'\fR is simply \*(L"\s-1SS\s0\*(R" and that the upper case version of 
y\*: \f(CW\*(C`y WITH DIAERESIS\*(C'\fR is not in the 0..255 range but it is 
at U+x0178 in Unicode, or \f(CW"\ex{178}"\fR in a Unicode enabled Perl).
.PP
The sort order will cause differences between results obtained on
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 platforms versus \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.  What follows are some suggestions
on how to deal with these differences.
.SS "Ignore \s-1ASCII\s0 vs. \s-1EBCDIC\s0 sort differences."
.IX Subsection "Ignore ASCII vs. EBCDIC sort differences."
This is the least computationally expensive strategy.  It may require
some user education.
.SS "\s-1MONO\s0 \s-1CASE\s0 then sort data."
.IX Subsection "MONO CASE then sort data."
In order to minimize the expense of mono casing mixed-case text, try to
\&\f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR towards the character set case most employed within the data.
If the data are primarily \s-1UPPERCASE\s0 non Latin 1 then apply tr/[a\-z]/[A\-Z]/
then \fIsort()\fR.  If the data are primarily lowercase non Latin 1 then
apply tr/[A\-Z]/[a\-z]/ before sorting.  If the data are primarily \s-1UPPERCASE\s0
and include Latin\-1 characters then apply:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    tr/[a\-z]/[A\-Z]/;
\&    tr/[a\*`a\*'a\*^a\*~a\*:a\*o\*(aec\*,e\*`e\*'e\*^e\*:i\*`i\*'i\*^i\*:\*(d-n\*~o\*`o\*'o\*^o\*~o\*:o\*/u\*`u\*'u\*^u\*:y\*'\*(th]/[A\*`A\*'A\*^A\*~A\*:A\*o\*(AEC\*,E\*`E\*'E\*^E\*:I\*`I\*'I\*^I\*:\*(D-N\*~O\*`O\*'O\*^O\*~O\*:O\*/U\*`U\*'U\*^U\*:Y\*'\*(Th/;
\&    s/\*8/SS/g;
.Ve
.PP
then \fIsort()\fR.  Do note however that such Latin\-1 manipulation does not 
address the y\*: \f(CW\*(C`y WITH DIAERESIS\*(C'\fR character that will remain at 
code point 255 on \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms, but 223 on most \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms 
where it will sort to a place less than the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 numerals.  With a 
Unicode-enabled Perl you might try:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    tr/^?/\ex{178}/;
.Ve
.PP
The strategy of mono casing data before sorting does not preserve the case 
of the data and may not be acceptable for that reason.
.SS "Convert, sort data, then re convert."
.IX Subsection "Convert, sort data, then re convert."
This is the most expensive proposition that does not employ a network
connection.
.SS "Perform sorting on one type of platform only."

This strategy can employ a network connection.  As such
it would be computationally expensive.
.SH "TRANSFORMATION FORMATS"
.IX Header "TRANSFORMATION FORMATS"
There are a variety of ways of transforming data with an intra character set 
mapping that serve a variety of purposes.  Sorting was discussed in the 
previous section and a few of the other more popular mapping techniques are 
discussed next.
.SS "\s-1URL\s0 decoding and encoding"
.IX Subsection "URL decoding and encoding"
Note that some URLs have hexadecimal \s-1ASCII\s0 code points in them in an
attempt to overcome character or protocol limitation issues.  For example 
the tilde character is not on every keyboard hence a \s-1URL\s0 of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1

.SS "Caesarean ciphers"
.IX Subsection "Caesarean ciphers"
The practice of shifting an alphabet one or more characters for encipherment
dates back thousands of years and was explicitly detailed by Gaius Julius
Caesar in his \fBGallic Wars\fR text.  A single alphabet shift is sometimes 
referred to as a rotation and the shift amount is given as a number \f(CW$n\fR after
the string 'rot' or \*(L"rot$n\*(R".  Rot0 and rot26 would designate identity maps 
on the 26\-letter English version of the Latin alphabet.  Rot13 has the 
interesting property that alternate subsequent invocations are identity maps 
(thus rot13 is its own non-trivial inverse in the group of 26 alphabet 
rotations).  Hence the following is a rot13 encoder and decoder that will 
work on \s-1ASCII\s0 and \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms:

.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
This pod document contains literal Latin 1 characters and may encounter 
translation difficulties.  In particular one popular nroff implementation 
was known to strip accented characters to their unaccented counterparts 
while attempting to view this document through the \fBpod2man\fR program 
(for example, you may see a plain \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR rather than one with a diaeresis 
as in y\*:).  Another nroff truncated the resultant manpage at
the first occurrence of 8 bit characters.
.PP
Not all shells will allow multiple \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR string arguments to perl to
be concatenated together properly as recipes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6 might 
seem to imply.

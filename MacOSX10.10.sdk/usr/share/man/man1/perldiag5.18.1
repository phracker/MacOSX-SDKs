.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    (W) A warning (optional).
\&    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
\&    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
\&    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
\&    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
\&    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
\&    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
.Ve
.PP
The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D & S) can be controlled using the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma.
.PP
If a message can be controlled by the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.  E.g. \f(CW\*(C`(W closed)\*(C'\fR means a warning in the \f(CW\*(C`closed\*(C'\fR category.
.PP
Optional warnings are enabled by using the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma or the \fB\-w\fR
and \fB\-W\fR switches.  Warnings may be captured by setting \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR
to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See perlvar.
.PP
Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled
with the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma or the \fB\-X\fR switch.
.PP
Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
\&\*(L"eval\*(R" in perlfunc.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma.
See warnings.
.PP
The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a \f(CW%s\fR or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.
.ie n .IP "\fIaccept()\fR on closed socket %s" 4
.el .IP "\fIaccept()\fR on closed socket \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "accept() on closed socket %s"
(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your \fIsocket()\fR call?  See
\&\*(L"accept\*(R" in perlfunc.
.ie n .IP "Allocation too large: %x" 4
.el .IP "Allocation too large: \f(CW%x\fR" 4
.IX Item "Allocation too large: %x"
(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.
.ie n .IP "'%c' allowed only after types %s" 4
.el .IP "'%c' allowed only after types \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "'%c' allowed only after types %s"
(F) The modifiers '!', '<' and '>' are allowed in \fIpack()\fR or \fIunpack()\fR only
after certain types.  See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &"
(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.
.Sp
To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the \f(CW\*(C`use subs\*(C'\fR pragma).
.Sp
To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the \f(CW\*(C`CORE::\*(C'\fR prefix
on the operator (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`CORE::log($x)\*(C'\fR) or declare the subroutine
to be an object method (see \*(L"Subroutine Attributes\*(R" in perlsub or
attributes).
.IP "Ambiguous range in transliteration operator" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous range in transliteration operator"
(F) You wrote something like \f(CW\*(C`tr/a\-z\-0//\*(C'\fR which doesn't mean anything at
all.  To include a \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR character in a transliteration, put it either
first or last.  (In the past, \f(CW\*(C`tr/a\-z\-0//\*(C'\fR was synonymous with
\&\f(CW\*(C`tr/a\-y//\*(C'\fR, which was probably not what you would have expected.)
.ie n .IP "Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s" 4
.el .IP "Ambiguous use of \f(CW%s\fR resolved as \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s"
(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.
.ie n .IP "Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c" 4
.el .IP "Ambiguous use of \f(CW%c\fR resolved as operator \f(CW%c\fR" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c"
(S ambiguous) \f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR are both infix operators (modulus,
bitwise and, and multiplication) \fIand\fR initial special characters
(denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something
like \f(CW\*(C`*foo * foo\*(C'\fR that might be interpreted as either of them.  We
assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try to make it more
clear \*(-- in the example given, you might write \f(CW\*(C`*foo * foo()\*(C'\fR if you
really meant to multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.
.ie n .IP "Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s" 4
.el .IP "Ambiguous use of \f(CW%c\fR{%s} resolved to \f(CW%c\fR%s" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s"
(W ambiguous) You wrote something like \f(CW\*(C`@{foo}\*(C'\fR, which might be
asking for the variable \f(CW@foo\fR, or it might be calling a function
named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference.  If you wanted
the variable, you can just write \f(CW@foo\fR.  If you wanted to call the
function, write \f(CW\*(C`@{foo()}\*(C'\fR ... or you could just not have a variable
and a function with the same name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.
.ie n .IP "Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]" 4
.el .IP "Ambiguous use of \f(CW%c\fR{%s[...]} resolved to \f(CW%c\fR%s[...]" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}" 4
.el .IP "Ambiguous use of \f(CW%c\fR{%s{...}} resolved to \f(CW%c\fR%s{...}" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}"
.PD
(W ambiguous) You wrote something like \f(CW\*(C`${foo[2]}\*(C'\fR (where foo represents
the name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number
2 of the array named \f(CW@foo\fR, in which case please write \f(CW$foo[2]\fR, or you
might have meant to pass an anonymous arrayref to the function named
foo, and then do a scalar deref on the value it returns.  If you meant
that, write \f(CW\*(C`${foo([2])}\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
In regular expressions, the \f(CW\*(C`${foo[2]}\*(C'\fR syntax is sometimes necessary
to disambiguate between array subscripts and character classes.
\&\f(CW\*(C`/$length[2345]/\*(C'\fR, for instance, will be interpreted as \f(CW$length\fR followed
by the character class \f(CW\*(C`[2345]\*(C'\fR.  If an array subscript is what you
want, you can avoid the warning by changing \f(CW\*(C`/${length[2345]}/\*(C'\fR to the
unsightly \f(CW\*(C`/${\e$length[2345]}/\*(C'\fR, by renaming your array to something
that does not coincide with a built-in keyword, or by simply turning
off warnings with \f(CW\*(C`no warnings \*(Aqambiguous\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR.
.IP "Ambiguous use of \-%s resolved as \-&%s()" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&%s()"
(S ambiguous) You wrote something like \f(CW\*(C`\-foo\*(C'\fR, which might be the
string \f(CW"\-foo"\fR, or a call to the function \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR, negated.  If you meant
the string, just write \f(CW"\-foo"\fR.  If you meant the function call,
write \f(CW\*(C`\-foo()\*(C'\fR.
.IP "'|' and '<' may not both be specified on command line" 4
.IX Item "'|' and '<' may not both be specified on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS. \s0 Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that \s-1STDIN\s0 was a pipe, and that you also tried to
redirect \s-1STDIN\s0 using '<'.  Only one \s-1STDIN\s0 stream to a customer, please.
.IP "'|' and '>' may not both be specified on command line" 4
.IX Item "'|' and '>' may not both be specified on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS. \s0 Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and
into a pipe to another command.  You need to choose one or the other,
though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script
which 'splits' output into two streams, such as
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    open(OUT,">$ARGV[0]") or die "Can\*(Aqt write to $ARGV[0]: $!";
\&    while (<STDIN>) {
\&        print;
\&        print OUT;
\&    }
\&    close OUT;
.Ve
.ie n .IP "Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)" 4
.el .IP "Applying \f(CW%s\fR to \f(CW%s\fR will act on scalar(%s)" 4
.IX Item "Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)"
(W misc) The pattern match (\f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR), substitution (\f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR), and
transliteration (\f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply
one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to
a scalar value (the length of an array, or the population info of a
hash) and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what
you meant to do.  See \*(L"grep\*(R" in perlfunc and \*(L"map\*(R" in perlfunc for
alternatives.
.IP "Arg too short for msgsnd" 4
.IX Item "Arg too short for msgsnd"
(F) \fImsgsnd()\fR requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).
.ie n .IP "%s argument is not a \s-1HASH\s0 or \s-1ARRAY\s0 element or a subroutine" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%s\fR argument is not a \s-1HASH\s0 or \s-1ARRAY\s0 element or a subroutine" 4
.IX Item "%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or a subroutine"
(F) The argument to \fIexists()\fR must be a hash or array element or a
subroutine with an ampersand, such as:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $foo{$bar}
\&    $ref\->{"susie"}[12]
\&    &do_something
.Ve
.ie n .IP "%s argument is not a \s-1HASH\s0 or \s-1ARRAY\s0 element or slice" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%s\fR argument is not a \s-1HASH\s0 or \s-1ARRAY\s0 element or slice" 4
.IX Item "%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice"
(F) The argument to \fIdelete()\fR must be either a hash or array element,
such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $foo{$bar}
\&    $ref\->{"susie"}[12]
.Ve
.Sp
or a hash or array slice, such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
\&    @{$ref\->[12]}{"susie", "queue"}
.Ve
.ie n .IP "%s argument is not a subroutine name" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%s\fR argument is not a subroutine name" 4
.IX Item "%s argument is not a subroutine name"
(F) The argument to \fIexists()\fR for \f(CW\*(C`exists &sub\*(C'\fR must be a subroutine
name, and not a subroutine call.  \f(CW\*(C`exists &sub()\*(C'\fR will generate this
error.
.ie n .IP "Argument ""%s"" isn't numeric%s" 4
.el .IP "Argument ``%s'' isn't numeric%s" 4
.IX Item "Argument %s isn't numeric%s"
(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
.ie n .IP "Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer %s"
(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O
system you forgot the ) that closes the argument list.  (Layers
take care of transforming data between external and internal
representations.)  Perl stopped parsing the layer list at this
point and did not attempt to push this layer.  If your program
didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the
result of the value of the environment variable \s-1PERLIO.\s0
.ie n .IP "Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()" 4
.el .IP "Array @%s missing the @ in argument \f(CW%d\fR of %s()" 4
.IX Item "Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()"
(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.
.IP "A sequence of multiple spaces in a charnames alias definition is deprecated" 4
.IX Item "A sequence of multiple spaces in a charnames alias definition is deprecated"
(D) You defined a character name which had multiple space characters in
a row.  Change them to single spaces.  Usually these names are defined
in the \f(CW\*(C`:alias\*(C'\fR import argument to \f(CW\*(C`use charnames\*(C'\fR, but they could be
defined by a translator installed into \f(CW$^H{charnames}\fR.  See
\&\*(L"\s-1CUSTOM ALIASES\*(R"\s0 in charnames.
.ie n .IP "assertion botched: %s" 4
.el .IP "assertion botched: \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "assertion botched: %s"
(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.
.ie n .IP "Assertion failed: file ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "Assertion failed: file ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "Assertion failed: file %s"
(X) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.
.IP "Assigning non-zero to $[ is no longer possible" 4
.IX Item "Assigning non-zero to $[ is no longer possible"
(F) When the \*(L"array_base\*(R" feature is disabled (e.g., under \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16;\*(C'\fR)
the special variable \f(CW$[\fR, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero value.
.IP "Assignment to both a list and a scalar" 4
.IX Item "Assignment to both a list and a scalar"
(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.
.ie n .IP "A thread exited while %d threads were running" 4
.el .IP "A thread exited while \f(CW%d\fR threads were running" 4
.IX Item "A thread exited while %d threads were running"
(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily
the main thread) exited while there were still other threads running.
Usually it's a good idea first to collect the return values of the
created threads by joining them, and only then to exit from the main
thread.  See threads.
.IP "Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash"
(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in
the current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.
.IP "Attempt to bless into a reference" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to bless into a reference"
(F) The \s-1CLASSNAME\s0 argument to the \fIbless()\fR operator is expected to be
the name of the package to bless the resulting object into.  You've
supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    bless $self, $proto;
.Ve
.Sp
when you intended
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;
.Ve
.Sp
If you actually want to bless into the stringified version
of the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for
example by:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    bless $self, "$proto";
.Ve
.IP "Attempt to clear deleted array" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to clear deleted array"
(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed.
Freed values are not supposed to be visible to Perl code.  This
can also happen if \s-1XS\s0 code calls \f(CW\*(C`av_clear\*(C'\fR from a custom magic
callback on the array.
.IP "Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash"
(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key
which is not in its key set.
.IP "Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash"
(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been
declared readonly from a restricted hash.
.IP "Attempt to free non-arena \s-1SV:\s0 0x%x" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%x"
(S internal) All \s-1SV\s0 objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas
that will be garbage collected on exit.  An \s-1SV\s0 was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.
.IP "Attempt to free nonexistent shared string '%s'%s" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to free nonexistent shared string '%s'%s"
(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of
strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other
strings.  This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count
of a string that can no longer be found in the table.
.IP "Attempt to free temp prematurely: \s-1SV\s0 0x%x" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to free temp prematurely: SV 0x%x"
(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
\&\fIfree_tmps()\fR routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the
\&\s-1SV\s0 before the \fIfree_tmps()\fR routine gets a chance, which means that the
\&\fIfree_tmps()\fR routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does
try to free it.
.IP "Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers"
(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.
.IP "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: \s-1SV\s0 0x%x" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x"
(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that \fISvREFCNT_dec()\fR was called too many times, or
that \fISvREFCNT_inc()\fR was called too few times, or that the \s-1SV\s0 was
mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been

to move the \fIjoin()\fR to some other thread.
.IP "Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value"
(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the \*(L"p\*(R" \fIpack()\fR template.  This
means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become
invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use
literals or global values as arguments to the \*(L"p\*(R" \fIpack()\fR template to
avoid this warning.

.IX Item "Attempt to reload %s aborted."
(F) You tried to load a file with \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR that failed to
compile once already.  Perl will not try to compile this file again
unless you delete its entry from \f(CW%INC\fR.  See \*(L"require\*(R" in perlfunc and

.IP "Attempt to set length of freed array" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to set length of freed array"
(W misc) You tried to set the length of an array which has
been freed.  You can do this by storing a reference to the
scalar representing the last index of an array and later
assigning through that reference.  For example
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $r = do {my @a; \e$#a};
\&    $$r = 503
.Ve
.IP "Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr"
(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to \fIsubstr()\fR
used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first.  See \*(L"substr\*(R" in perlfunc.
.ie n .IP "Attribute ""locked"" is deprecated" 4

The :unique attribute has had no effect since Perl 5.8.8, and
will be removed in a future release of Perl 5.
.IP "av_reify called on tied array" 4
.IX Item "av_reify called on tied array"
(S debugging) This indicates that something went wrong and Perl got \fIvery\fR
confused about \f(CW@_\fR or \f(CW@DB::args\fR being tied.

(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of \fImsgctl()\fR, \fIsemctl()\fR
or \fIshmctl()\fR.  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,
sizeof(struct\ msqid_ds\ *), sizeof(struct\ semid_ds\ *), and

.IP "Bad evalled substitution pattern" 4
.IX Item "Bad evalled substitution pattern"
(F) You've used the \f(CW\*(C`/e\*(C'\fR switch to evaluate the replacement for a

most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.
.ie n .IP "Bad filehandle: %s" 4
.el .IP "Bad filehandle: \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Bad filehandle: %s"
(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the
symbol has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an
\&\fIopen()\fR, or did it in another package.

.IX Item "Bad free() ignored"
(S malloc) An internal routine called \fIfree()\fR on something that had never
been \fImalloc()\fRed in the first place.  Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PERL_BADFREE\*(C'\fR to 0.

(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then
didn't finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside
of quotes, so

.IP "Bareword found in conditional" 4
.IX Item "Bareword found in conditional"
(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or && was parsed as part
of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    open FOO || die;
.Ve
.Sp
It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use constant TYPO => 1;
\&    if (TYOP) { print "foo" }
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`strict\*(C'\fR pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.
.ie n .IP "Bareword ""%s"" not allowed while ""strict subs"" in use" 4
.el .IP "Bareword ``%s'' not allowed while ``strict subs'' in use" 4
.IX Item "Bareword %s not allowed while strict subs in use"
(F) With \*(L"strict subs\*(R" in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the \*(L"=>\*(R"
symbol.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?
.ie n .IP "Bareword ""%s"" refers to nonexistent package" 4
.el .IP "Bareword ``%s'' refers to nonexistent package" 4
.IX Item "Bareword %s refers to nonexistent package"
(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form \f(CW\*(C`Foo::\*(C'\fR, but the
compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point.  Perhaps
you need to predeclare a package?
.IP "\s-1BEGIN\s0 failed\*(--compilation aborted" 4
.IX Item "BEGIN failedcompilation aborted"
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a \s-1BEGIN\s0
subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.
.IP "\s-1BEGIN\s0 not safe after errors\*(--compilation aborted" 4
.IX Item "BEGIN not safe after errorscompilation aborted"
(F) Perl found a \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN {}\*(C'\fR subroutine (or a \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR directive, which
implies a \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN {}\*(C'\fR) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred.  Since the intended environment for the \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN {}\*(C'\fR could not
be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely
depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.
.ie n .IP "\e1 better written as $1" 4
.el .IP "\e1 better written as \f(CW$1\fR" 4
.IX Item "1 better written as $1"
(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.
The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
there are more than 9 backreferences.

(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via \fIcall_sv()\fR
exited by calling exit.
.IP "%s() called too early to check prototype" 4
.IX Item "%s() called too early to check prototype"
(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an
early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype
checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the
function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning.  See perlsub.
.IP "Cannot compress integer in pack" 4
.IX Item "Cannot compress integer in pack"
(F) An argument to pack(\*(L"w\*(R",...) was too large to compress.  The \s-1BER\s0
compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you
attempted to compress Infinity or a very large number (> 1e308).
See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.

.IX Item "Cannot convert a reference to %s to typeglob"
(F) You manipulated Perl's symbol table directly, stored a reference

The access triggers Perl to autovivify that typeglob, but it there is
no legal conversion from that type of reference to a typeglob.
.ie n .IP "Cannot copy to %s" 4

.IX Item "Can only compress unsigned integers in pack"
(F) An argument to pack(\*(L"w\*(R",...) was not an integer.  The \s-1BER\s0 compressed

.IP "Can't get filespec \- stale stat buffer?" 4
.IX Item "Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?"
(S) A warning peculiar to \s-1VMS. \s0 This arises because of the difference
between access checks under \s-1VMS\s0 and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under \s-1VMS,\s0 access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access-checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and \s-1FID\s0 present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the \s-1CRTL\s0 \fIstat()\fR routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up
and returned \s-1FALSE,\s0 just to be conservative.  (Note: The access-checking
routine knows about the Perl \f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fR operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)

(F) A \*(L"goto\*(R" statement was executed to jump out of what might look like

(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the \s-1SIGCHLD\s0
signal (sometimes known as \s-1SIGCLD\s0) disabled.  Since disabling this
signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child

(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension.
This may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one
that is incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known
to happen between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your

(S utf8, non_unicode) You had a code point above the Unicode maximum

.Sp
Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points, up
to the limit of what is storable in an unsigned integer on your system,
but these may not be accepted by other languages/systems.  At one time,
it was legal in some standards to have code points up to 0x7FFF_FFFF,
but not higher.  Code points above 0xFFFF_FFFF require larger than a
32 bit word.
.Sp
None of the Unicode or Perl-defined properties will match a non-Unicode
code point.  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    chr(0x7FF_FFFF) =~ /\ep{Any}/
.Ve
.Sp
will not match, because the code point is not in Unicode.  But
.Sp
.Vb 1

will match.

conditional.  Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of
static variable.  Since we intend to fix this bug, we don't want people
relying on this behavior.  You can achieve a similar static effect by
declaring the variable in a separate block outside the function, eg
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }
.Ve
.Sp
becomes
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    { my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }
.Ve
.Sp
Beginning with perl 5.9.4, you can also use \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR variables to have
lexicals that are initialized only once (see feature):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub f { state $x; return $x++ }
.Ve
.IP "\s-1DESTROY\s0 created new reference to dead object '%s'" 4
.IX Item "DESTROY created new reference to dead object '%s'"
(F) A \s-1\fIDESTROY\s0()\fR method created a new reference to the object which is
just being DESTROYed.  Perl is confused, and prefers to abort rather
than to create a dangling reference.
.IP "Did not produce a valid header" 4
.IX Item "Did not produce a valid header"
See Server error.
.ie n .IP "%s did not return a true value" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%s\fR did not return a true value" 4
.IX Item "%s did not return a true value"
(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a \*(L"1;\*(R", though any true value would
do.  See \*(L"require\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "(Did you mean &%s instead?)" 4
.IX Item "(Did you mean &%s instead?)"
(W misc) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &FOO as \f(CW$FOO\fR or
some such.
.ie n .IP "(Did you mean ""local"" instead of ""our""?)" 4
.el .IP "(Did you mean ``local'' instead of ``our''?)" 4
.IX Item "(Did you mean local instead of our?)"
(W misc) Remember that \*(L"our\*(R" does not localize the declared global
variable.  You have declared it again in the same lexical scope, which
seems superfluous.
.IP "(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)" 4
.IX Item "(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)"
(W) You probably said \f(CW%hash\fR{$key} when you meant \f(CW$hash\fR{$key} or
\&\f(CW@hash\fR{@keys}.  On the other hand, maybe you just meant \f(CW%hash\fR and got
carried away.
.IP "Died" 4
.IX Item "Died"
(F) You passed \fIdie()\fR an empty string (the equivalent of \f(CW\*(C`die ""\*(C'\fR) or
you called it with no args and \f(CW$@\fR was empty.
.IP "Document contains no data" 4
.IX Item "Document contains no data"
See Server error.
.ie n .IP "%s does not define %s::VERSION\*(--version check failed" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%s\fR does not define \f(CW%s::VERSION\fR\*(--version check failed" 4
.IX Item "%s does not define %s::VERSIONversion check failed"
(F) You said something like \*(L"use Module 42\*(R" but the Module did not
define a \f(CW$VERSION\fR.
.IP "'/' does not take a repeat count" 4
.IX Item "'/' does not take a repeat count"
(F) You cannot put a repeat count of any kind right after the '/' code.
See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Don't know how to handle magic of type '%s'" 4
.IX Item "Don't know how to handle magic of type '%s'"
(P) The internal handling of magical variables has been cursed.
.IP "do_study: out of memory" 4
.IX Item "do_study: out of memory"
(P) This should have been caught by \fIsafemalloc()\fR instead.
.ie n .IP "(Do you need to predeclare %s?)" 4
.el .IP "(Do you need to predeclare \f(CW%s\fR?)" 4
.IX Item "(Do you need to predeclare %s?)"
(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
\&\*(L"%s found where operator expected\*(R".  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
\&\*(L"sub\*(R", \*(L"package\*(R", \*(L"require\*(R", or \*(L"use\*(R" statement.  If you're referencing
something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have to define the
subroutine or package before the current location.  You can use an empty
\&\*(L"sub foo;\*(R" or \*(L"package \s-1FOO\s0;\*(R" to enter a \*(L"forward\*(R" declaration.
.IP "\fIdump()\fR better written as \fICORE::dump()\fR" 4
.IX Item "dump() better written as CORE::dump()"
(W misc) You used the obsolescent \f(CW\*(C`dump()\*(C'\fR built-in function, without fully
qualifying it as \f(CW\*(C`CORE::dump()\*(C'\fR.  Maybe it's a typo.  See \*(L"dump\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "dump is not supported" 4
.IX Item "dump is not supported"
(F) Your machine doesn't support dump/undump.
.IP "Duplicate \fIfree()\fR ignored" 4
.IX Item "Duplicate free() ignored"
(S malloc) An internal routine called \fIfree()\fR on something that had
already been freed.
.ie n .IP "Duplicate modifier '%c' after '%c' in %s" 4
.el .IP "Duplicate modifier '%c' after '%c' in \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Duplicate modifier '%c' after '%c' in %s"
(W unpack) You have applied the same modifier more than once after a
type in a pack template.  See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "elseif should be elsif" 4
.IX Item "elseif should be elsif"
(S syntax) There is no keyword \*(L"elseif\*(R" in Perl because Larry thinks
it's ugly.  Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method
named \*(L"elseif\*(R" for the class returned by the following block.  This is
unlikely to be what you want.
.IP "Empty \e%c{} in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "Empty %c{} in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) \f(CW\*(C`\ep\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eP\*(C'\fR are used to introduce a named Unicode property, as
described in perlunicode and perlre.  You used \f(CW\*(C`\ep\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\eP\*(C'\fR in
a regular expression without specifying the property name.
.ie n .IP "entering effective %s failed" 4
.el .IP "entering effective \f(CW%s\fR failed" 4
.IX Item "entering effective %s failed"
(F) While under the \f(CW\*(C`use filetest\*(C'\fR pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.
.ie n .IP "%ENV is aliased to %s" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%ENV\fR is aliased to \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "%ENV is aliased to %s"
(F) You're running under taint mode, and the \f(CW%ENV\fR variable has been
aliased to another hash, so it doesn't reflect anymore the state of the
program's environment.  This is potentially insecure.
.ie n .IP "Error converting file specification %s" 4
.el .IP "Error converting file specification \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Error converting file specification %s"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS. \s0 Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either \s-1VMS\s0 or Unix syntax, it converts them to a
single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you've passed
an invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a case the
conversion routines don't handle.  Drat.
.IP "Escape literal pattern white space under /x" 4
.IX Item "Escape literal pattern white space under /x"
(D deprecated) You compiled a regular expression pattern with \f(CW\*(C`/x\*(C'\fR to
ignore white space, and you used, as a literal, one of the characters
that Perl plans to eventually treat as white space.  The character must
be escaped somehow, or it will work differently on a future Perl that
does treat it as white space.  The easiest way is to insert a backslash
immediately before it, or to enclose it with square brackets.  This
change is to bring Perl into conformance with Unicode recommendations.
Here are the five characters that generate this warning:
U+0085 \s-1NEXT LINE,
U+200E\s0 LEFT-TO-RIGHT \s-1MARK,
U+200F\s0 RIGHT-TO-LEFT \s-1MARK,
U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR,\s0
and
U+2029 \s-1PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR.\s0
.IP "Eval-group in insecure regular expression" 4
.IX Item "Eval-group in insecure regular expression"
(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular
expression that contains the \f(CW\*(C`(?{ ... })\*(C'\fR zero-width assertion, which
is unsafe.  See \*(L"(?{ code })\*(R" in perlre, and perlsec.
.IP "Eval-group not allowed at runtime, use re 'eval' in regex m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "Eval-group not allowed at runtime, use re 'eval' in regex m/%s/"
(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the
\&\f(CW\*(C`(?{ ... })\*(C'\fR zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the
pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk,
it is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`re \*(Aqeval\*(Aq\*(C'\fR pragma or by explicitly building the pattern from an
interpolated string at run time and using that in an \fIeval()\fR.  See
\&\*(L"(?{ code })\*(R" in perlre.
.IP "Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval' in regex m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval' in regex m/%s/"
(F) A regular expression contained the \f(CW\*(C`(?{ ... })\*(C'\fR zero-width
assertion, but that construct is only allowed when the \f(CW\*(C`use re \*(Aqeval\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
pragma is in effect.  See \*(L"(?{ code })\*(R" in perlre.
.IP "\s-1EVAL\s0 without pos change exceeded limit in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "EVAL without pos change exceeded limit in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) You used a pattern that nested too many \s-1EVAL\s0 calls without consuming
any text.  Restructure the pattern so that text is consumed.
.Sp
The <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was
discovered.
.IP "Excessively long <> operator" 4
.IX Item "Excessively long <> operator"
(F) The contents of a <> operator may not exceed the maximum size of a
Perl identifier.  If you're just trying to glob a long list of
filenames, try using the \fIglob()\fR operator, or put the filenames into a
variable and glob that.
.IP "exec? I'm not *that* kind of operating system" 4
.IX Item "exec? I'm not *that* kind of operating system"
(F) The \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR function is not implemented on some systems, e.g., Symbian

(F)
You wrote something like

.Ve
.Sp
to denote a capturing group of the form

\&    use feature \*(Aqlexical_subs\*(Aq;
\&    my sub foo { ... }
.Ve
.IP "Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)" 4
.IX Item "Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)"
(W misc) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string.  This has
the effect of blessing the reference into the package main.  This is
usually not what you want.  Consider providing a default target package,
e.g. bless($ref, \f(CW$p\fR || 'MyPackage');
.ie n .IP "%s: Expression syntax" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%s:\fR Expression syntax" 4
.IX Item "%s: Expression syntax"
(A) You've accidentally run your script through \fBcsh\fR instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.
.ie n .IP "%s failed\*(--call queue aborted" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%s\fR failed\*(--call queue aborted" 4
.IX Item "%s failedcall queue aborted"
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a \s-1UNITCHECK,
CHECK, INIT,\s0 or \s-1END\s0 subroutine.  Processing of the remainder of the
queue of such routines has been prematurely ended.
.ie n .IP "False [] range ""%s"" in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.el .IP "False [] range ``%s'' in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "False [] range %s in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a literal
character, not another character class like \f(CW\*(C`\ed\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`[:alpha:]\*(C'\fR.  The \*(L"\-\*(R"
in your false range is interpreted as a literal \*(L"\-\*(R".  Consider quoting the
\&\*(L"\-\*(R", \*(L"\e\-\*(R".  The <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 shows whereabouts in the regular expression the
problem was discovered.  See perlre.
.ie n .IP "Fatal \s-1VMS\s0 error (status=%d) at %s, line %d" 4
.el .IP "Fatal \s-1VMS\s0 error (status=%d) at \f(CW%s\fR, line \f(CW%d\fR" 4
.IX Item "Fatal VMS error (status=%d) at %s, line %d"
(P) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS. \s0 Something untoward happened in a \s-1VMS\s0
system service or \s-1RTL\s0 routine; Perl's exit status should provide more
details.  The filename in \*(L"at \f(CW%s\fR\*(R" and the line number in \*(L"line \f(CW%d\fR\*(R" tell
you which section of the Perl source code is distressed.
.IP "fcntl is not implemented" 4
.IX Item "fcntl is not implemented"
(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement \fIfcntl()\fR.  What is this, a
\&\s-1PDP\-11\s0 or something?
.IP "\s-1FETCHSIZE\s0 returned a negative value" 4
.IX Item "FETCHSIZE returned a negative value"
(F) A tied array claimed to have a negative number of elements, which
is not possible.
.IP "Field too wide in 'u' format in pack" 4
.IX Item "Field too wide in 'u' format in pack"
(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string starts with a length indicator
which can't encode values above 63.  So there is no point in asking for
a line length bigger than that.  Perl will behave as if you specified
\&\f(CW\*(C`u63\*(C'\fR as the format.
.ie n .IP "Filehandle %s opened only for input" 4
.el .IP "Filehandle \f(CW%s\fR opened only for input" 4
.IX Item "Filehandle %s opened only for input"
(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you intended
it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with \*(L"+<\*(R" or
\&\*(L"+>\*(R" or \*(L"+>>\*(R" instead of with \*(L"<\*(R" or nothing.  If you intended only to
write the file, use \*(L">\*(R" or \*(L">>\*(R".  See \*(L"open\*(R" in perlfunc.
.ie n .IP "Filehandle %s opened only for output" 4
.el .IP "Filehandle \f(CW%s\fR opened only for output" 4
.IX Item "Filehandle %s opened only for output"
(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If
you intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it
with \*(L"+<\*(R" or \*(L"+>\*(R" or \*(L"+>>\*(R" instead of with \*(L">\*(R".  If you intended only to
read from the file, use \*(L"<\*(R".  See \*(L"open\*(R" in perlfunc.  Another possibility
is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0 (also known as \s-1STDIN\s0) for
output (maybe you closed \s-1STDIN\s0 earlier?).
.ie n .IP "Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input" 4
.el .IP "Filehandle \f(CW%s\fR reopened as \f(CW%s\fR only for input" 4
.IX Item "Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input"
(W io) You opened for reading a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as \s-1STDOUT\s0 or \s-1STDERR. \s0 This occurred because you closed \s-1STDOUT\s0 or \s-1STDERR\s0
previously.
.ie n .IP "Filehandle \s-1STDIN\s0 reopened as %s only for output" 4
.el .IP "Filehandle \s-1STDIN\s0 reopened as \f(CW%s\fR only for output" 4

(W io) You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as \s-1STDIN. \s0 This occurred because you closed \s-1STDIN\s0 previously.
.ie n .IP "Final $ should be \e$ or $name" 4
.el .IP "Final $ should be \e$ or \f(CW$name\fR" 4
.IX Item "Final $ should be $ or $name"
(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be
a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that
happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or the
name.
.ie n .IP "\fIflock()\fR on closed filehandle %s" 4
.el .IP "\fIflock()\fR on closed filehandle \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "flock() on closed filehandle %s"
(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to \fIflock()\fR got itself closed
some time before now.  Check your control flow.  \fIflock()\fR operates on
filehandles.  Are you attempting to call \fIflock()\fR on a dirhandle by the
same name?
.IP "Format not terminated" 4
.IX Item "Format not terminated"
(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot.  Perl got
to the end of your file without finding such a line.
.ie n .IP "Format %s redefined" 4
.el .IP "Format \f(CW%s\fR redefined" 4

\&        eval "format NAME =...";
\&    }
.Ve

.Sp
(or something like that).
.ie n .IP "%s found where operator expected" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%s\fR found where operator expected" 4
.IX Item "%s found where operator expected"
(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.
If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an
operator, it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an
operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.
.ie n .IP "gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "gdbm store returned \f(CW%d\fR, errno \f(CW%d\fR, key ``%s''" 4

(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.
.IP "gethostent not implemented" 4
.IX Item "gethostent not implemented"
(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement \fIgethostent()\fR, probably
because if it did, it'd feel morally obligated to return every hostname

\&\*(L"getsockopt\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "given is experimental" 4
.IX Item "given is experimental"
(S experimental::smartmatch) \f(CW\*(C`given\*(C'\fR depends on both a lexical \f(CW$_\fR and
smartmatch, both of which are experimental, so its behavior may change or
even be removed in any future release of perl.
See the explanation under \*(L"Experimental Details on given and when\*(R" in perlsyn.
.ie n .IP "Global symbol ""%s"" requires explicit package name" 4

(F) You've said \*(L"use strict\*(R" or \*(L"use strict vars\*(R", which indicates 
that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using \*(L"my\*(R" or \*(L"state\*(R"), 
declared beforehand using \*(L"our\*(R", or explicitly qualified to say 
which package the global variable is in (using \*(L"::\*(R").
.IP "glob failed (%s)" 4
.IX Item "glob failed (%s)"
(S glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used
for \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`<*.c>\*(C'\fR.  Usually, this means that you supplied a \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR
pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a
nonzero status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit
resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell)
is broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables
in config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as
if it were csh (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`full_csh=\*(Aq/usr/bin/tcsh\*(Aq\*(C'\fR); otherwise, make them
all empty (except that \f(CW\*(C`d_csh\*(C'\fR should be \f(CW\*(Aqundef\*(Aq\fR) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
\&\f(CW\*(C`./Configure \-S\*(C'\fR and rebuild Perl.
.IP "Glob not terminated" 4
.IX Item "Glob not terminated"
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a \*(L"less than\*(R".
.IP "gmtime(%f) too large" 4
.IX Item "gmtime(%f) too large"
(W overflow) You called \f(CW\*(C`gmtime\*(C'\fR with a number that was larger than
it can reliably handle and \f(CW\*(C`gmtime\*(C'\fR probably returned the wrong

not-a-number value).
.IP "gmtime(%f) too small" 4
.IX Item "gmtime(%f) too small"
(W overflow) You called \f(CW\*(C`gmtime\*(C'\fR with a number that was smaller than
it can reliably handle and \f(CW\*(C`gmtime\*(C'\fR probably returned the wrong date.
.IP "Got an error from DosAllocMem" 4
.IX Item "Got an error from DosAllocMem"
(P) An error peculiar to \s-1OS/2. \s0 Most probably you're using an obsolete

(F) You tried to call a subroutine with \f(CW\*(C`goto &sub\*(C'\fR syntax, but
the indicated subroutine hasn't been defined, or if it was, it
has since been undefined.

.IX Item "Group name must start with a non-digit word character in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) Group names must follow the rules for perl identifiers, meaning
they must start with a non-digit word character. A common cause of
this error is using (?&0) instead of (?0). See perlre.

.IX Item "Hexadecimal number > 0xffffffff non-portable"
(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32\-1

.IP "\-i used with no filenames on the command line, reading from \s-1STDIN\s0" 4
.IX Item "-i used with no filenames on the command line, reading from STDIN"
(S inplace) The \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR option was passed on the command line, indicating
that the script is intended to edit files inplace, but no files were
given.  This is usually a mistake, since editing \s-1STDIN\s0 inplace doesn't
make sense, and can be confusing because it can make perl look like
it is hanging when it is really just trying to read from \s-1STDIN. \s0 You
should either pass a filename to edit, or remove \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR from the command
line.  See perlrun for more details.
.IP "Identifier too long" 4
.IX Item "Identifier too long"
(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like \f(CW$A::B\fR).  You've exceeded Perl's limits.  Future versions
of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.

Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &, \e, and +.
.IP "Illegal character \e%o (carriage return)" 4
.IX Item "Illegal character %o (carriage return)"
(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it

.IX Item "(in cleanup) %s"
(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a \s-1\fIDESTROY\s0()\fR method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the
system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of
times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.

(D regexp, deprecated)
The two-character sequence \f(CW"(*"\fR in this context in a regular

(F)
There was a syntax error within the \f(CW\*(C`(?[ ])\*(C'\fR.  This can happen if the
expression inside the construct was completely empty, or if there are
too many or few operands for the number of operators.  Perl is not smart
enough to give you a more precise indication as to what is wrong.

(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like.
The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or

.IX Item "Integer overflow in format string for %s"
(F) The indexes and widths specified in the format string of \f(CW\*(C`printf()\*(C'\fR

(S overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified
either as a literal or as an argument to \fIhex()\fR or \fIoct()\fR is too big for
your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point number.
On a 32\-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl
transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation
internally\*(--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent
operations.

(S overflow) The number you have passed to srand is too big to fit
in your architecture's integer representation.  The number has been
replaced with the largest integer supported (0xFFFFFFFF on 32\-bit
architectures).  This means you may be getting less randomness than
you expect, because different random seeds above the maximum will

(W overflow) Some portion of a version initialization is too large for
the size of integers for your architecture.  This is not a warning
because there is no rational reason for a version to try and use an

(F) A version number did not meet the \*(L"lax\*(R" criteria for versions.
A \*(L"lax\*(R" version number is a positive decimal number (integer or
decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal
v\-string.  If the v\-string has fewer than three components, it
must have a leading 'v' character.  Otherwise, the leading 'v' is
optional.  Both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a
trailing \*(L"alpha\*(R" component separated by an underscore character
after a fractional or dotted-decimal component.  The parenthesized
text indicates which criteria were not met.  See the version module
for more details on allowed version formats.

.IX Item "IO layers (like '%s') unavailable"
(F) Your Perl has not been configured to have PerlIO, and therefore
you cannot use \s-1IO\s0 layers.  To have PerlIO, Perl must be configured
with 'useperlio'.

.IP "$* is no longer supported" 4
.IX Item "$* is no longer supported"
(D deprecated, syntax) The special variable \f(CW$*\fR, deprecated in older
perls, has been removed as of 5.9.0 and is no longer supported.  In
previous versions of perl the use of \f(CW$*\fR enabled or disabled multi-line
matching within a string.
.Sp
Instead of using \f(CW$*\fR you should use the \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR (and maybe \f(CW\*(C`/s\*(C'\fR) regexp
modifiers.  You can enable \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR for a lexical scope (even a whole file)
with \f(CW\*(C`use re \*(Aq/m\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.  (In older versions: when \f(CW$*\fR was set to a true value
then all regular expressions behaved as if they were written using \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR.)

.IX Item "Lost precision when %s %f by 1"
(W imprecision) The value you attempted to increment or decrement by one
is too large for the underlying floating point representation to store
accurately, hence the target of \f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR is unchanged.  Perl issues this
warning because it has already switched from integers to floating point
when values are too large for integers, and now even floating point is
insufficient.  You may wish to switch to using Math::BigInt explicitly.

.IX Item "lstat() on filehandle%s"
(W io) You tried to do an lstat on a filehandle.  What did you mean

.IX Item "lvalue attribute %s already-defined subroutine"
(W misc) Although attributes.pm allows this, turning the lvalue

(S utf8)(F) Perl detected a string that didn't comply with \s-1UTF\-8\s0
encoding rules, even though it had the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag on.
.Sp
One possible cause is that you set the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag yourself for data that
you thought to be in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 but it wasn't (it was for example legacy

.Sp
If you use the \f(CW\*(C`:encoding(UTF\-8)\*(C'\fR PerlIO layer for input, invalid byte
sequences are handled gracefully, but if you use \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR, the flag is
set without validating the data, possibly resulting in this error

.IP "Missing right brace on \eN{} or unescaped left brace after \eN" 4
.IX Item "Missing right brace on N{} or unescaped left brace after N"
(F) \f(CW\*(C`\eN\*(C'\fR has two meanings.
.Sp
The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in braces,
meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
name.  Thus \f(CW\*(C`\eN{ASTERISK}\*(C'\fR is another way of writing \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR, valid in both
double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns.  In patterns,
it doesn't have the meaning an unescaped \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR does.
.Sp
Starting in Perl 5.12.0, \f(CW\*(C`\eN\*(C'\fR also can have an additional meaning (only)
in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.  (This is short
for \f(CW\*(C`[^\en]\*(C'\fR, and like \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR but is not affected by the \f(CW\*(C`/s\*(C'\fR regex modifier.)
.Sp
This can lead to some ambiguities.  When \f(CW\*(C`\eN\*(C'\fR is not followed immediately
by a left brace, Perl assumes the \f(CW\*(C`[^\en]\*(C'\fR meaning.  Also, if the braces
form a valid quantifier such as \f(CW\*(C`\eN{3}\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\eN{5,}\*(C'\fR, Perl assumes that this
means to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples,
3; and 5 or more, respectively).  In all other case, where there is a
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{\*(C'\fR and a matching \f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR, Perl assumes that a character name is desired.
.Sp
However, if there is no matching \f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR, Perl doesn't know if it was
mistakenly omitted, or if \f(CW\*(C`[^\en]{\*(C'\fR was desired, and raises this error.
If you meant the former, add the right brace; if you meant the latter,
escape the brace with a backslash, like so: \f(CW\*(C`\eN\e{\*(C'\fR
.IP "Missing right curly or square bracket" 4

.el .IP "``my'' variable \f(CW%s\fR can't be in a package" 4

.el .IP "Name ``%s::%s'' used only once: possible typo" 4
.IX Item "Name %s::%s used only once: possible typo"
(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names.
If you had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention it
again somehow to suppress the message.  The \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR declaration is
provided for this purpose.
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 This warning detects symbols that have been used only once so \f(CW$c\fR, \f(CW@c\fR,
\&\f(CW%c\fR, *c, &c, sub c{}, c(), and c (the filehandle or format) are considered
the same; if a program uses \f(CW$c\fR only once but also uses any of the others it
will not trigger this warning.

.IX Item "N in a character class must be a named character: N{...} in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) The new (5.12) meaning of \f(CW\*(C`\eN\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`[^\en]\*(C'\fR is not valid in a bracketed
character class, for the same reason that \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR in a character class loses
its specialness: it matches almost everything, which is probably not
what you want.
.IP "\eN{\s-1NAME\s0} must be resolved by the lexer in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "N{NAME} must be resolved by the lexer in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) When compiling a regex pattern, an unresolved named character or
sequence was encountered.  This can happen in any of several ways that
bypass the lexer, such as using single-quotish context, or an extra
backslash in double-quotish:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $re = \*(Aq\eN{SPACE}\*(Aq;  # Wrong!
\&    $re = "\e\eN{SPACE}"; # Wrong!
\&    /$re/;
.Ve
.Sp
Instead, use double-quotes with a single backslash:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $re = "\eN{SPACE}";  # ok
\&    /$re/;
.Ve
.Sp
The lexer can be bypassed as well by creating the pattern from smaller
components:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $re = \*(Aq\eN\*(Aq;
\&    /${re}{SPACE}/;     # Wrong!
.Ve
.Sp
It's not a good idea to split a construct in the middle like this, and it
doesn't work here.  Instead use the solution above.
.Sp
Finally, the message also can happen under the \f(CW\*(C`/x\*(C'\fR regex modifier when the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN\*(C'\fR is separated by spaces from the \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR, in which case, remove the spaces.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    /\eN {SPACE}/x;      # Wrong!
\&    /\eN{SPACE}/x;       # ok
.Ve
.IP "Need exactly 3 octal digits in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "Need exactly 3 octal digits in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) Within \f(CW\*(C`(?[\ \ \ ])\*(C'\fR, all constants interpreted as octal need to be
exactly 3 digits long.  This helps catch some ambiguities.  If your
constant is too short, add leading zeros, like
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& (?[ [ \e078 ] ])     # Syntax error!
\& (?[ [ \e0078 ] ])    # Works
\& (?[ [ \e007 8 ] ])   # Clearer
.Ve
.Sp
The maximum number this construct can express is \f(CW\*(C`\e777\*(C'\fR.  If you
need a larger one, you need to use \eo{}
instead.  If you meant two separate things, you need to separate them
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& (?[ [ \e7776 ] ])        # Syntax error!
\& (?[ [ \eo{7776} ] ])     # One meaning
\& (?[ [ \e777 6 ] ])       # Another meaning

.IP "Negative offset to vec in lvalue context" 4
.IX Item "Negative offset to vec in lvalue context"
(F) When \f(CW\*(C`vec\*(C'\fR is called in an lvalue context, the second argument must be
greater than or equal to zero.
.IP "Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parentheses.
So things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal.  The <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 shows
whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.
.Sp
Note that the minimal matching quantifiers, \f(CW\*(C`*?\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`+?\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`??\*(C'\fR appear to be nested quantifiers, but aren't.  See perlre.

See mro.
.ie n .IP "No %s allowed while running setuid" 4

will be another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least
securable.  See perlsec.
.IP "No code specified for \-%c" 4
.IX Item "No code specified for -%c"
(F) Perl's \fB\-e\fR and \fB\-E\fR command-line options require an argument.  If
you want to run an empty program, pass the empty string as a separate
argument or run a program consisting of a single 0 or 1:
.Sp
.Vb 3

.Ve
.ie n .IP "No comma allowed after %s" 4
.el .IP "No comma allowed after \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "No comma allowed after %s"
(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or \*(L"indirect object\*(R" is
not allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.
.Sp
One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported
a constant to your name space with \fBuse\fR or \fBimport\fR while no such
importing took place, it may for example be that your operating
system does not support that particular constant.  Hopefully you did
use an explicit import list for the constants you expect to see;
please see \*(L"use\*(R" in perlfunc and \*(L"import\*(R" in perlfunc.  While an
explicit import list would probably have caught this error earlier
it naturally does not remedy the fact that your operating system
still does not support that constant.  Maybe you have a typo in
the constants of the symbol import list of \fBuse\fR or \fBimport\fR or in the
constant name at the line where this error was triggered?
.IP "No command into which to pipe on command line" 4
.IX Item "No command into which to pipe on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS. \s0 Perl handles its own command line

(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the \fB\-d\fR switch, but
for some reason the current debugger (e.g. \fIperl5db.pl\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`Devel::\*(C'\fR

.IP "No dbm on this machine" 4
.IX Item "No dbm on this machine"
(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with \s-1SDBM. \s0 See SDBM_File.
.IP "No DB::sub routine defined" 4
.IX Item "No DB::sub routine defined"
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the \fB\-d\fR switch, but
for some reason the current debugger (e.g. \fIperl5db.pl\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`Devel::\*(C'\fR
module) didn't define a \f(CW\*(C`DB::sub\*(C'\fR routine to be called at the beginning
of each ordinary subroutine call.
.IP "No directory specified for \-I" 4
.IX Item "No directory specified for -I"
(F) The \fB\-I\fR command-line switch requires a directory name as part of the
\&\fIsame\fR argument.  Use \fB\-Ilib\fR, for instance.  \fB\-I lib\fR won't work.
.IP "No error file after 2> or 2>> on command line" 4
.IX Item "No error file after 2> or 2>> on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS. \s0 Perl handles its own command line

.IX Item "No such pipe open"
(P) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS. \s0 The internal routine \fImy_pclose()\fR tried to
close a pipe which hadn't been opened.  This should have been caught
earlier as an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.

(F)
You wrote something like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& (?[ \ep{Digit} \ep{Thai} ])
.Ve
.Sp
There are two operands, but no operator giving how you want to combine
them.
.ie n .IP "Operation ""%s"": no method found, %s" 4
.el .IP "Operation ``%s'': no method found, \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Operation %s: no method found, %s"
(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which no
handler was defined.  While some handlers can be autogenerated in terms
of other handlers, there is no default handler for any operation, unless
the \f(CW\*(C`fallback\*(C'\fR overloading key is specified to be true.  See overload.
.ie n .IP "Operation ""%s"" returns its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X" 4
.el .IP "Operation ``%s'' returns its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X" 4
.IX Item "Operation %s returns its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X"
(S utf8, non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring Unicode
semantics on a code point that is not in Unicode, so what it should do
is not defined.  Perl has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn you.
.Sp
If the operation shown is \*(L"ToFold\*(R", it means that case-insensitive
matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.
.Sp
If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
\&\f(CW\*(C`no warnings \*(Aqnon_unicode\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP "Operation ""%s"" returns its argument for \s-1UTF\-16\s0 surrogate U+%X" 4
.el .IP "Operation ``%s'' returns its argument for \s-1UTF\-16\s0 surrogate U+%X" 4
.IX Item "Operation %s returns its argument for UTF-16 surrogate U+%X"
(S utf8, surrogate) You performed an operation requiring Unicode
semantics on a Unicode surrogate.  Unicode frowns upon the use of
surrogates for anything but storing strings in \s-1UTF\-16,\s0 but semantics
are (reluctantly) defined for the surrogates, and they are to do
nothing for this operation.  Because the use of surrogates can be
dangerous, Perl warns.
.Sp
If the operation shown is \*(L"ToFold\*(R", it means that case-insensitive
matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.
.Sp
If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
\&\f(CW\*(C`no warnings \*(Aqsurrogate\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP "Operator or semicolon missing before %s" 4
.el .IP "Operator or semicolon missing before \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Operator or semicolon missing before %s"
(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser
was expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant to
use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.  For
example, if you say \*(L"*foo *foo\*(R" it will be interpreted as if you said
\&\*(L"*foo * 'foo'\*(R".
.ie n .IP """our"" variable %s redeclared" 4
.el .IP "``our'' variable \f(CW%s\fR redeclared" 4
.IX Item "our variable %s redeclared"
(W misc) You seem to have already declared the same global once before
in the current lexical scope.
.IP "Out of memory!" 4
.IX Item "Out of memory!"
(X) The \fImalloc()\fR function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  Perl has
no option but to exit immediately.
.Sp
At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by increasing your
process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use \f(CW\*(C`limit\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`limit datasize n\*(C'\fR (where \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR is the number of kilobytes) to check
the current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use \f(CW\*(C`ulimit \-a\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`ulimit \-d n\*(C'\fR, respectively.
.ie n .IP "Out of memory during %s extend" 4
.el .IP "Out of memory during \f(CW%s\fR extend" 4
.IX Item "Out of memory during %s extend"
(X) An attempt was made to extend an array, a list, or a string beyond
the largest possible memory allocation.
.ie n .IP "Out of memory during ""large"" request for %s" 4
.el .IP "Out of memory during ``large'' request for \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Out of memory during large request for %s"
(F) The \fImalloc()\fR function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  However,
the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a
possibility to shut down by trapping this error is granted.
.ie n .IP "Out of memory during request for %s" 4
.el .IP "Out of memory during request for \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Out of memory during request for %s"
(X)(F) The \fImalloc()\fR function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the
request.
.Sp
The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of \f(CW$^M\fR as an
emergency pool after \fIdie()\fRing with this message.  In this case the error
is trappable \fIonce\fR, and the error message will include the line and file
where the failed request happened.
.IP "Out of memory during ridiculously large request" 4
.IX Item "Out of memory during ridiculously large request"
(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+\*(L"small amount\*(R" bytes.  This error
is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,
\&\f(CW$arr[time]\fR instead of \f(CW$arr[$time]\fR.
.IP "Out of memory for yacc stack" 4
.IX Item "Out of memory for yacc stack"
(F) The yacc parser wanted to grow its stack so it could continue
parsing, but \fIrealloc()\fR wouldn't give it more memory, virtual or
otherwise.
.IP "'.' outside of string in pack" 4
.IX Item "'.' outside of string in pack"
(F) The argument to a '.' in your template tried to move the working
position to before the start of the packed string being built.
.IP "'@' outside of string in unpack" 4
.IX Item "'@' outside of string in unpack"
(F) You had a template that specified an absolute position outside
the string being unpacked.  See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "'@' outside of string with malformed \s-1UTF\-8\s0 in unpack" 4
.IX Item "'@' outside of string with malformed UTF-8 in unpack"
(F) You had a template that specified an absolute position outside
the string being unpacked.  The string being unpacked was also invalid
\&\s-1UTF\-8. \s0 See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "overload arg '%s' is invalid" 4
.IX Item "overload arg '%s' is invalid"
(W overload) The overload pragma was passed an argument it did not
recognize.  Did you mistype an operator?
.IP "Overloaded dereference did not return a reference" 4
.IX Item "Overloaded dereference did not return a reference"
(F) An object with an overloaded dereference operator was dereferenced,
but the overloaded operation did not return a reference.  See
overload.
.IP "Overloaded qr did not return a \s-1REGEXP\s0" 4
.IX Item "Overloaded qr did not return a REGEXP"
(F) An object with a \f(CW\*(C`qr\*(C'\fR overload was used as part of a match, but the
overloaded operation didn't return a compiled regexp.  See overload.
.ie n .IP "%s package attribute may clash with future reserved word: %s" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%s\fR package attribute may clash with future reserved word: \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "%s package attribute may clash with future reserved word: %s"
(W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used that had a
package-specific handler.  That name might have a meaning to Perl itself
some day, even though it doesn't yet.  Perhaps you should use a
mixed-case attribute name, instead.  See attributes.
.IP "pack/unpack repeat count overflow" 4
.IX Item "pack/unpack repeat count overflow"
(F) You can't specify a repeat count so large that it overflows your
signed integers.  See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.

.el .IP "panic: attempt to call \f(CW%s\fR in \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "panic: attempt to call %s in %s"
(P) One of the file test operators entered a code branch that calls
an \s-1ACL\s0 related-function, but that function is not available on this
platform.  Earlier checks mean that it should not be possible to
enter this branch on this platform.
.IP "panic: child pseudo-process was never scheduled" 4
.IX Item "panic: child pseudo-process was never scheduled"
(P) A child pseudo-process in the ithreads implementation on Windows
was not scheduled within the time period allowed and therefore was not
able to initialize properly.

.IX Item "panic: goto, type=%u, ix=%ld"
(P) We popped the context stack to a context with the specified label,
and then discovered it wasn't a context we know how to do a goto in.
.IP "panic: gp_free failed to free glob pointer" 4
.IX Item "panic: gp_free failed to free glob pointer"
(P) The internal routine used to clear a typeglob's entries tried
repeatedly, but each time something re-created entries in the glob.
Most likely the glob contains an object with a reference back to
the glob and a destructor that adds a new object to the glob.

.IX Item "Passing malformed UTF-8 to %s is deprecated"
(D deprecated, utf8) This message indicates a bug either in the Perl
core or in \s-1XS\s0 code.  Such code was trying to find out if a character,
allegedly stored internally encoded as \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 was of a given type, such
as being punctuation or a digit.  But the character was not encoded in
legal \s-1UTF\-8. \s0 The \f(CW%s\fR is replaced by a string that can be used by

.IX Item "Pattern subroutine nesting without pos change exceeded limit in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) You used a pattern that uses too many nested subpattern calls without

.IX Item "Perl %s required (did you mean %s?)--this is only %s, stopped"
(F) The code you are trying to run has asked for a newer version of
Perl than you are running.  Perhaps \f(CW\*(C`use 5.10\*(C'\fR was written instead
of \f(CW\*(C`use 5.010\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`use v5.10\*(C'\fR.  Without the leading \f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR, the number is

(S) The whole warning message will look something like:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
\&        perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
\&                LC_ALL = "En_US",

\&            are supported and installed on your system.
\&        perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
.Ve
.Sp
Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies.  In the above the
settings were that the \s-1LC_ALL\s0 was \*(L"En_US\*(R" and the \s-1LANG\s0 had no value.
This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your operating
system supplier and/or system administrator have set up the so-called
locale system but Perl could not use those settings.  This was not
dead serious, fortunately: there is a \*(L"default locale\*(R" called \*(L"C\*(R" that
Perl can and will use, and the script will be run.  Before you really
fix the problem, however, you will get the same error message each
time you run Perl.  How to really fix the problem can be found in
perllocale section \fB\s-1LOCALE PROBLEMS\s0\fR.

.IP "Possible attempt to put comments in \fIqw()\fR list" 4
.IX Item "Possible attempt to put comments in qw() list"
(W qw) \fIqw()\fR lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with literal
strings, comment characters are not ignored, but are instead treated as
literal data.  (You may have used different delimiters than the
parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently used.)
.Sp
You probably wrote something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    @list = qw(

If you really want comments, build your list the
old-fashioned way, with quotes and commas:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    @list = (

(W qw) \fIqw()\fR lists contain items separated by whitespace; therefore
commas aren't needed to separate the items.  (You may have used
different delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces are also
frequently used.)
.Sp
You probably wrote something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1

(F) An \fIioctl()\fR or \fIfcntl()\fR returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the
end of the buffer just in case.  This sentinel byte got clobbered, and
Perl assumes that memory is now corrupted.  See \*(L"ioctl\*(R" in perlfunc.
.ie n .IP "Possible precedence problem on bitwise %c operator" 4
.el .IP "Possible precedence problem on bitwise \f(CW%c\fR operator" 4

(W precedence) Your program uses a bitwise logical operator in conjunction
with a numeric comparison operator, like this :
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ($x & $y == 0) { ... }
.Ve
.Sp
This expression is actually equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`$x & ($y == 0)\*(C'\fR, due to the
higher precedence of \f(CW\*(C`==\*(C'\fR.  This is probably not what you want.  (If you
really meant to write this, disable the warning, or, better, put the
parentheses explicitly and write \f(CW\*(C`$x & ($y == 0)\*(C'\fR).
.IP "Possible unintended interpolation of $\e in regex" 4
.IX Item "Possible unintended interpolation of $ in regex"
(W ambiguous) You said something like \f(CW\*(C`m/$\e/\*(C'\fR in a regex.
The regex \f(CW\*(C`m/foo$\es+bar/m\*(C'\fR translates to: match the word 'foo', the output
record separator (see \*(L"$\e\*(R" in perlvar) and the letter 's' (one time or more)
followed by the word 'bar'.
.Sp
If this is what you intended then you can silence the warning by using 
\&\f(CW\*(C`m/${\e}/\*(C'\fR (for example: \f(CW\*(C`m/foo${\e}s+bar/\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
If instead you intended to match the word 'foo' at the end of the line
followed by whitespace and the word 'bar' on the next line then you can use
\&\f(CW\*(C`m/$(?)\e/\*(C'\fR (for example: \f(CW\*(C`m/foo$(?)\es+bar/\*(C'\fR).
.ie n .IP "Possible unintended interpolation of %s in string" 4
.el .IP "Possible unintended interpolation of \f(CW%s\fR in string" 4

(W ambiguous) You said something like '@foo' in a double-quoted string

because of the strict regularization of Perl 5's grammar into unary and

.IP "\ep{} uses Unicode rules, not locale rules" 4
.IX Item "p{} uses Unicode rules, not locale rules"
(W) You compiled a regular expression that contained a Unicode property
match (\f(CW\*(C`\ep\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\eP\*(C'\fR), but the regular expression is also being told to
use the run-time locale, not Unicode.  Instead, use a \s-1POSIX\s0 character
class, which should know about the locale's rules.
(See \*(L"\s-1POSIX\s0 Character Classes\*(R" in perlrecharclass.)
.Sp
Even if the run-time locale is \s-1ISO 8859\-1 \s0(Latin1), which is a subset of
Unicode, some properties will give results that are not valid for that
subset.
.Sp
Here are a couple of examples to help you see what's going on.  If the
locale is \s-1ISO 8859\-7,\s0 the character at code point 0xD7 is the \*(L"\s-1GREEK
CAPITAL LETTER CHI\*(R". \s0 But in Unicode that code point means the
\&\*(L"\s-1MULTIPLICATION SIGN\*(R"\s0 instead, and \f(CW\*(C`\ep\*(C'\fR always uses the Unicode
meaning.  That means that \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Alpha}\*(C'\fR won't match, but \f(CW\*(C`[[:alpha:]]\*(C'\fR
should.  Only in the Latin1 locale are all the characters in the same
positions as they are in Unicode.  But, even here, some properties give
incorrect results.  An example is \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Changes_When_Uppercased}\*(C'\fR which
is true for \*(L"\s-1LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS\*(R",\s0 but since the upper
case of that character is not in Latin1, in that locale it doesn't
change when upper cased.

the minus), instead of the one you want to turn off.

are meaningless.
.IP "'%s' resolved to '\eo{%s}%d'" 4
.IX Item "'%s' resolved to 'o{%s}%d'"
(W misc, regexp)  You wrote something like \f(CW\*(C`\e08\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`\e179\*(C'\fR in a
double-quotish string.  All but the last digit is treated as a single
character, specified in octal.  The last digit is the next character in
the string.  To tell Perl that this is indeed what you want, you can use
the \f(CW\*(C`\eo{ }\*(C'\fR syntax, or use exactly three digits to specify the octal
for the character.
.ie n .IP "Reversed %s= operator" 4

.IX Item "Scalars leaked: %d"
(S internal) Something went wrong in Perl's internal bookkeeping
of scalars: not all scalar variables were deallocated by the time
Perl exited.  What this usually indicates is a memory leak, which
is of course bad, especially if the Perl program is intended to be
long-running.
.IP "Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]" 4
.IX Item "Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]"
(W syntax) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a
single element of an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar
value (indicated by $).  The difference is that \f(CW$foo[&bar]\fR always
behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its
argument, while \f(CW@foo[&bar]\fR behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things
if you're expecting only one subscript.
.Sp
On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array
element as a list, you need to look into how references work, because
Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you.  See
perlref.

.IX Item "Scalar value @%s{%s} better written as $%s{%s}"
(W syntax) You've used a hash slice (indicated by @) to select a single
element of a hash.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value
(indicated by $).  The difference is that \f(CW$foo{&bar}\fR always behaves
like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its
argument, while \f(CW@foo{&bar}\fR behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things

(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a // or m{}

Missing the leading \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR from a variable \f(CW$m\fR may cause this error.
.Sp
Note that since Perl 5.9.0 a // can also be the \fIdefined-or\fR

(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a \f(CW\*(C`?PATTERN?\*(C'\fR

.Sp
The question mark is also used as part of the ternary operator (as in
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo ? 0 : 1\*(C'\fR) leading to some ambiguous constructions being wrongly
parsed.  One way to disambiguate the parsing is to put parentheses around

(S experimental::smartmatch) This warning is emitted if you
use the smartmatch (\f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR) operator.  This is currently an experimental
feature, and its details are subject to change in future releases of

.IX Item "Statement unlikely to be reached"
(W exec) You did an \fIexec()\fR with some statement after it other than a

.ie n .IP "Subroutine ""&%s"" is not available" 4
.el .IP "Subroutine ``&%s'' is not available" 4
.IX Item "Subroutine &%s is not available"
(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently
available.  This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the lexical
subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not
yet been created.  (Remember that named subs are created at compile time,
while anonymous subs are created at run-time.)  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \e&a } }
.Ve
.Sp
At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current the \*(L"a\*(R" sub,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely, the
following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now
been created and is live:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub { my sub a {...} eval \*(Aqsub f { \e&a }\*(Aq }\->();
.Ve
.Sp
The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    sub f {
\&        my sub a {...}
\&        sub { eval \*(Aq\e&a\*(Aq }
\&    }
\&    f()\->();
.Ve
.Sp
Here, when the '\e&a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently
being executed, so its &a is not available for capture.

.el .IP "``%s'' subroutine &%s masks earlier declaration in same \f(CW%s\fR" 4

(W misc) A \*(L"my\*(R" or \*(L"state\*(R" subroutine has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to
the previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.
Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of

(W substr)(F) You tried to reference a \fIsubstr()\fR that pointed outside of
a string.  That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than the

Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on \fB\-w\fR.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl \-c\*(C'\fR repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20\ questions.

.el .IP "``\-T'' is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line" 4
.IX Item "-T is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line"
(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains
the \fB\-T\fR option (or the \fB\-t\fR option), but Perl was not invoked with
\&\fB\-T\fR in its command line.  This is an error because, by the time
Perl discovers a \fB\-T\fR in a script, it's too late to properly taint
everything from the environment.  So Perl gives up.
.Sp
If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be
fixed by editing the #! line so that the \fB\-%c\fR option is a part of
Perl's first argument: e.g. change \f(CW\*(C`perl \-n \-%c\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`perl \-%c \-n\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If the Perl script is being executed as \f(CW\*(C`perl scriptname\*(C'\fR, then the
\&\fB\-%c\fR option must appear on the command line: \f(CW\*(C`perl \-%c scriptname\*(C'\fR.

specified an illegal mapping.

.ie n .IP "Too late for ""\-%s"" option" 4
.el .IP "Too late for ``\-%s'' option" 4
.IX Item "Too late for -%s option"
(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
\&\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-m\fR or \fB\-C\fR option.
.Sp
In the case of \fB\-M\fR and \fB\-m\fR, this is an error because those options
are not intended for use inside scripts.  Use the \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR pragma instead.
.Sp
The \fB\-C\fR option only works if it is specified on the command line as
well (with the same sequence of letters or numbers following).  Either
specify this option on the command line, or, if your system supports
it, make your script executable and run it directly instead of passing
it to perl.

(F) The subroutine in question in the \s-1CORE\s0 package requires its argument

(P) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS. \s0 Perl was reading values for \f(CW%ENV\fR before
iterating over it, and someone else stuck a message in the stream of

.el .IP "Unknown regex modifier ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "Unknown regex modifier %s"
(F) Alphanumerics immediately following the closing delimiter
of a regular expression pattern are interpreted by Perl as modifier
flags for the regex.  One of the ones you specified is invalid.  One way
this can happen is if you didn't put in white space between the end of
the regex and a following alphanumeric operator:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& if ($a =~ /foo/and $bar == 3) { ... }
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW"a"\fR is a valid modifier flag, but the \f(CW"n"\fR is not, and raises
this error.  Likely what was meant instead was:

.IP "Useless use of '\e'; doesn't escape metacharacter '%c'" 4
.IX Item "Useless use of ''; doesn't escape metacharacter '%c'"
(D deprecated) You wrote a regular expression pattern something like
one of these:

\& m{foo\e{1,3\e}}
\& qr(foo\e(bar\e))
\& s[foo\e[a\-z\e]bar][baz]
.Ve
.Sp
The interior braces, square brackets, and parentheses are treated as
metacharacters even though they are backslashed; instead write:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& m{ \ex{FF} }x
\& m{foo{1,3}}
\& qr(foo(bar))
\& s[foo[a\-z]bar][baz]
.Ve
.Sp
The backslashes have no effect when a regular expression pattern is
delimitted by \f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[]\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`()\*(C'\fR, which ordinarily are
metacharacters, and the delimiters are also used, paired, within the
interior of the pattern.  It is planned that a future Perl release will
change the meaning of constructs like these so that the backslashes
will have an effect, so remove them from your code.

.ie n .IP "Useless use of %s in void context" 4
.el .IP "Useless use of \f(CW%s\fR in void context" 4
.IX Item "Useless use of %s in void context"
(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a
value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very
often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl
to parse your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd
get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $one, $two = 1, 2;
.Ve
.Sp
when you meant to say
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);
.Ve
.Sp
Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for
example, if you say
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $array = (1,2);
.Ve
.Sp
when you should have said
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $array = [1,2];
.Ve
.Sp
The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See
perlref for more on this.
.Sp
This warning will not be issued for numerical constants equal to 0 or 1
since they are often used in statements like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    1 while sub_with_side_effects();

String constants that would normally evaluate to 0 or 1 are warned
about.

usually have any effect on the array, so is completely useless.  It's
possible in principle that push(@tied_array) could have some effect
if the array is tied to a class which implements a \s-1PUSH\s0 method.  If so,
you can write it as \f(CW\*(C`push(@tied_array,())\*(C'\fR to avoid this warning.

.IP "Use of := for an empty attribute list is not allowed" 4
.IX Item "Use of := for an empty attribute list is not allowed"
(F) The construction \f(CW\*(C`my $x := 42\*(C'\fR used to parse as equivalent to
\&\f(CW\*(C`my $x : = 42\*(C'\fR (applying an empty attribute list to \f(CW$x\fR).
This construct was deprecated in 5.12.0, and has now been made a syntax
error, so \f(CW\*(C`:=\*(C'\fR can be reclaimed as a new operator in the future.

If you need an empty attribute list, for example in a code generator, add
a space before the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR.
.IP "Use of freed value in iteration" 4
.IX Item "Use of freed value in iteration"
(F) Perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop?
This error is typically caused by code like the following:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    @a = (3,4);
\&    @a = () for (1,2,@a);
.Ve
.Sp
You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are being iterated over.
For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does not do full
reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an item in the
middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.
.IP "Use of *glob{\s-1FILEHANDLE\s0} is deprecated" 4

.IX Item "Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split"
(W regexp) You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR

repeatedly, the \f(CW\*(C`/g\*(C'\fR has no effect.

.IP "Use of inherited \s-1AUTOLOAD\s0 for non-method %s() is deprecated" 4
.IX Item "Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated"
(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR
subroutines are looked up as methods (using the \f(CW@ISA\fR hierarchy)
even when the subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain
functions (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`Foo::bar()\*(C'\fR), not as methods (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`Foo\->bar()\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`$obj\->bar()\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fRs.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
\&\f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fRs.
.Sp
The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR for non-methods from a base class
named \f(CW\*(C`BaseClass\*(C'\fR, execute \f(CW\*(C`*AUTOLOAD = \e&BaseClass::AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR during
startup.
.Sp
In code that currently says \f(CW\*(C`use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);\*(C'\fR
you should remove AutoLoader from \f(CW@ISA\fR and change \f(CW\*(C`use AutoLoader;\*(C'\fR to
\&\f(CW\*(C`use AutoLoader \*(AqAUTOLOAD\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR.

.el .IP "Use of \f(CW%s\fR on a handle without * is deprecated" 4

(D deprecated) You used \f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`untie\*(C'\fR on a scalar but that scalar
happens to hold a typeglob, which means its filehandle will be tied.  If
you mean to tie a handle, use an explicit * as in \f(CW\*(C`tie *$handle\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This was a long-standing bug that was removed in Perl 5.16, as there was
no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob, and no way to
untie a scalar that had had a typeglob assigned to it.  If you see this
message, you must be using an older version.

.IX Item "Use of ?PATTERN? without explicit operator is deprecated"
(D deprecated) You have written something like \f(CW\*(C`?\ew?\*(C'\fR, for a regular
expression that matches only once.  Starting this term directly with
the question mark delimiter is now deprecated, so that the question mark
will be available for use in new operators in the future.  Write \f(CW\*(C`m?\ew?\*(C'\fR
instead, explicitly using the \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR operator: the question mark delimiter

(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index; this probably

If you really do mean it, explicitly numify your reference, like so:

(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
defined.  It was interpreted as a "" or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.
To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.
.Sp
To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you
the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined.  In some cases
it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the
undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program
anid the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear
literally in your program.  For example, \f(CW"that $foo"\fR is usually
optimized into \f(CW\*(C`"that " . $foo\*(C'\fR, and the warning will refer to the

.ie n .IP "Variable ""%s"" is not available" 4
.el .IP "Variable ``%s'' is not available" 4
.IX Item "Variable %s is not available"
(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the outer lexical may be
declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
(Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
subs are created at run-time.)  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }
.Ve
.Sp
At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current value of \f(CW$a\fR,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely,
the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by
now been created and is live:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub { my $a; eval \*(Aqsub f { $a }\*(Aq }\->();
.Ve
.Sp
The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    sub f {
\&        my $a;
\&        sub { eval \*(Aq$a\*(Aq }
\&    }
\&    f()\->();
.Ve
.Sp
Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being
executed, so its \f(CW$a\fR is not available for capture.
.ie n .IP "Variable ""%s"" is not imported%s" 4

(S misc) With \*(L"use strict\*(R" in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by
that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the
front of your variable.

(W misc) A \*(L"my\*(R", \*(L"our\*(R" or \*(L"state\*(R" variable has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the

.ie n .IP "Variable ""%s"" will not stay shared" 4
.el .IP "Variable ``%s'' will not stay shared" 4
.IX Item "Variable %s will not stay shared"
(W closure) An inner (nested) \fInamed\fR subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.
.Sp
When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the
variable will no longer be shared.
.Sp
This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the \f(CW\*(C`sub {}\*(C'\fR syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are created, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.

.SS "The Syntax of Variable Names"
.IX Subsection "The Syntax of Variable Names"
Variable names in Perl can have several formats.  Usually, they
must begin with a letter or underscore, in which case they can be
arbitrarily long (up to an internal limit of 251 characters) and
may contain letters, digits, underscores, or the special sequence
\&\f(CW\*(C`::\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.  In this case, the part before the last \f(CW\*(C`::\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq\*(C'\fR is taken to be a \fIpackage qualifier\fR; see perlmod.
.PP
Perl variable names may also be a sequence of digits or a single
punctuation or control character.  These names are all reserved for
special uses by Perl; for example, the all-digits names are used
to hold data captured by backreferences after a regular expression
match.  Perl has a special syntax for the single-control-character
names: It understands \f(CW\*(C`^X\*(C'\fR (caret \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR) to mean the control\-\f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR
character.  For example, the notation \f(CW$^W\fR (dollar-sign caret
\&\f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR) is the scalar variable whose name is the single character
control\-\f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR.  This is better than typing a literal control\-\f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR
into your program.
.PP
Since Perl 5.6, Perl variable names may be alphanumeric
strings that begin with control characters (or better yet, a caret).
These variables must be written in the form \f(CW\*(C`${^Foo}\*(C'\fR; the braces
are not optional.  \f(CW\*(C`${^Foo}\*(C'\fR denotes the scalar variable whose
name is a control\-\f(CW\*(C`F\*(C'\fR followed by two \f(CW\*(C`o\*(C'\fR's.  These variables are
reserved for future special uses by Perl, except for the ones that
begin with \f(CW\*(C`^_\*(C'\fR (control-underscore or caret-underscore).  No
control-character name that begins with \f(CW\*(C`^_\*(C'\fR will acquire a special
meaning in any future version of Perl; such names may therefore be
used safely in programs.  \f(CW$^_\fR itself, however, \fIis\fR reserved.
.PP
Perl identifiers that begin with digits, control characters, or
punctuation characters are exempt from the effects of the \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR
declaration and are always forced to be in package \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR; they are
also exempt from \f(CW\*(C`strict \*(Aqvars\*(Aq\*(C'\fR errors.  A few other names are also
exempt in these ways:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    ENV      STDIN
\&    INC      STDOUT
\&    ARGV     STDERR
\&    ARGVOUT
\&    SIG
.Ve
.PP
In particular, the special \f(CW\*(C`${^_XYZ}\*(C'\fR variables are always taken
to be in package \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR, regardless of any \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR declarations
presently in scope.
.SH "SPECIAL VARIABLES"
.IX Header "SPECIAL VARIABLES"
The following names have special meaning to Perl.  Most punctuation
names have reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in the shells.
Nevertheless, if you wish to use long variable names, you need only say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use English;
.Ve
.PP
at the top of your program.  This aliases all the short names to the long
names in the current package.  Some even have medium names, generally
borrowed from \fBawk\fR.  To avoid a performance hit, if you don't need the
\&\f(CW$PREMATCH\fR, \f(CW$MATCH\fR, or \f(CW$POSTMATCH\fR it's best to use the \f(CW\*(C`English\*(C'\fR
module without them:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use English \*(Aq\-no_match_vars\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
Before you continue, note the sort order for variables.  In general, we
first list the variables in case-insensitive, almost-lexigraphical
order (ignoring the \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR preceding words, as in \f(CW\*(C`${^UNICODE}\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW$^T\fR), although \f(CW$_\fR and \f(CW@_\fR move up to the top of the pile.
For variables with the same identifier, we list it in order of scalar,
array, hash, and bareword.

Here are the places where Perl will assume \f(CW$_\fR even if you don't use it:
.RS 8
.IP "\(bu" 3
The following functions use \f(CW$_\fR as a default argument:
.Sp
abs, alarm, chomp, chop, chr, chroot,
cos, defined, eval, evalbytes, exp, glob,
hex, int, lc, lcfirst, length, log, lstat, mkdir, oct, ord, pos, print,
quotemeta, readlink, readpipe, ref, require, reverse (in scalar context only),
rmdir, sin, split (on its second argument), sqrt, stat, study, uc, ucfirst,
unlink, unpack.
.IP "\(bu" 3
All file tests (\f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR) except for \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR, which defaults to \s-1STDIN\s0.
See \*(L"\-X\*(R" in perlfunc
.IP "\(bu" 3
The pattern matching operations \f(CW\*(C`m//\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR (aka \f(CW\*(C`y///\*(C'\fR)
when used without an \f(CW\*(C`=~\*(C'\fR operator.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The default iterator variable in a \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR loop if no other
variable is supplied.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The implicit iterator variable in the \f(CW\*(C`grep()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`map()\*(C'\fR functions.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The implicit variable of \f(CW\*(C`given()\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The default place to put an input record when a \f(CW\*(C`<FH>\*(C'\fR
operation's result is tested by itself as the sole criterion of a \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR
test.  Outside a \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR test, this will not happen.
.RE
.RS 8
.Sp
As \f(CW$_\fR is a global variable, this may lead in some cases to unwanted
side-effects.  As of perl 5.10, you can now use a lexical version of
\&\f(CW$_\fR by declaring it in a file or in a block with \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR.  Moreover,
declaring \f(CW\*(C`our $_\*(C'\fR restores the global \f(CW$_\fR in the current scope.
.Sp
Mnemonic: underline is understood in certain operations.

Within a subroutine the array \f(CW@_\fR contains the parameters passed to
that subroutine.  Inside a subroutine, \f(CW@_\fR is the default array for
the array operators \f(CW\*(C`push\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pop\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`shift\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`unshift\*(C'\fR.

.PD
When an array or an array slice is interpolated into a double-quoted
string or a similar context such as \f(CW\*(C`/.../\*(C'\fR, its elements are
separated by this value.  Default is a space.  For example, this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print "The array is: @array\en";
.Ve
.Sp
is equivalent to this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print "The array is: " . join($", @array) . "\en";
.Ve
.Sp
Mnemonic: works in double-quoted context.

.PD
The process number of the Perl running this script.  Though you \fIcan\fR set
this variable, doing so is generally discouraged, although it can be
invaluable for some testing purposes.  It will be reset automatically
across \f(CW\*(C`fork()\*(C'\fR calls.
.Sp
Note for Linux and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl v5.16.0 perl
would emulate \s-1POSIX\s0 semantics on Linux systems using LinuxThreads, a
partial implementation of \s-1POSIX\s0 Threads that has since been superseded
by the Native \s-1POSIX\s0 Thread Library (\s-1NPTL\s0).
.Sp
LinuxThreads is now obsolete on Linux, and and caching \f(CW\*(C`getpid()\*(C'\fR
like this made embedding perl unnecessarily complex (since you'd have
to manually update the value of $$), so now \f(CW$$\fR and \f(CW\*(C`getppid()\*(C'\fR
will always return the same values as the underlying C library.
.Sp
Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems also used LinuxThreads up until and
including the 6.0 release, but after that moved to FreeBSD thread
semantics, which are POSIX-like.
.Sp
To see if your system is affected by this discrepancy check if
\&\f(CW\*(C`getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep \-q NPTL\*(C'\fR returns a false
value. \s-1NTPL\s0 threads preserve the \s-1POSIX\s0 semantics.
.Sp
Mnemonic: same as shells.

.ie n .IP "$0" 8

.IX Xref "$0 $PROGRAM_NAME"

.PD
Contains the name of the program being executed.
.Sp
On some (but not all) operating systems assigning to \f(CW$0\fR modifies
the argument area that the \f(CW\*(C`ps\*(C'\fR program sees.  On some platforms you
may have to use special \f(CW\*(C`ps\*(C'\fR options or a different \f(CW\*(C`ps\*(C'\fR to see the
changes.  Modifying the \f(CW$0\fR is more useful as a way of indicating the
current program state than it is for hiding the program you're
running.
.Sp
Note that there are platform-specific limitations on the maximum
length of \f(CW$0\fR.  In the most extreme case it may be limited to the
space occupied by the original \f(CW$0\fR.
.Sp
In some platforms there may be arbitrary amount of padding, for
example space characters, after the modified name as shown by \f(CW\*(C`ps\*(C'\fR.
In some platforms this padding may extend all the way to the original
length of the argument area, no matter what you do (this is the case
for example with Linux 2.2).
.Sp
Note for \s-1BSD\s0 users: setting \f(CW$0\fR does not completely remove \*(L"perl\*(R"
from the \fIps\fR\|(1) output.  For example, setting \f(CW$0\fR to \f(CW"foobar"\fR may
result in \f(CW"perl: foobar (perl)"\fR (whether both the \f(CW"perl: "\fR prefix
and the \*(L" (perl)\*(R" suffix are shown depends on your exact \s-1BSD\s0 variant
and version).  This is an operating system feature, Perl cannot help it.
.Sp
In multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so that any
thread may modify its copy of the \f(CW$0\fR and the change becomes visible
to \fIps\fR\|(1) (assuming the operating system plays along).  Note that
the view of \f(CW$0\fR the other threads have will not change since they
have their own copies of it.
.Sp
If the program has been given to perl via the switches \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-E\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW$0\fR will contain the string \f(CW"\-e"\fR.
.Sp
On Linux as of perl 5.14 the legacy process name will be set with
\&\f(CWprctl(2)\fR, in addition to altering the \s-1POSIX\s0 name via \f(CW\*(C`argv[0]\*(C'\fR as
perl has done since version 4.000.  Now system utilities that read the
legacy process name such as ps, top and killall will recognize the
name you set when assigning to \f(CW$0\fR.  The string you supply will be
cut off at 16 bytes, this is a limitation imposed by Linux.
.Sp
Mnemonic: same as \fBsh\fR and \fBksh\fR.

The real gid of this process.  If you are on a machine that supports

\&\f(CW\*(C`getgid()\*(C'\fR, and the subsequent ones by \f(CW\*(C`getgroups()\*(C'\fR, one of which may be
the same as the first number.
.Sp
However, a value assigned to \f(CW$(\fR must be a single number used to
set the real gid.  So the value given by \f(CW$(\fR should \fInot\fR be assigned
back to \f(CW$(\fR without being forced numeric, such as by adding zero.  Note
that this is different to the effective gid (\f(CW$)\fR) which does take a
list.
.Sp
You can change both the real gid and the effective gid at the same
time by using \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::setgid()\*(C'\fR.  Changes
to \f(CW$(\fR require a check to \f(CW$!\fR

one of which may be the same as the first number.
.Sp
Similarly, a value assigned to \f(CW$)\fR must also be a space-separated
list of numbers.  The first number sets the effective gid, and
the rest (if any) are passed to \f(CW\*(C`setgroups()\*(C'\fR.  To get the effect of an
empty list for \f(CW\*(C`setgroups()\*(C'\fR, just repeat the new effective gid; that is,
to force an effective gid of 5 and an effectively empty \f(CW\*(C`setgroups()\*(C'\fR
list, say \f(CW\*(C` $) = "5 5" \*(C'\fR.
.Sp
You can change both the effective gid and the real gid at the same
time by using \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::setgid()\*(C'\fR (use only a single numeric argument).
Changes to \f(CW$)\fR require a check to \f(CW$!\fR to detect any possible errors

\&\f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR constructs look for their library files.  It
initially consists of the arguments to any \fB\-I\fR command-line
switches, followed by the default Perl library, probably
\&\fI/usr/local/lib/perl\fR, followed by \*(L".\*(R", to represent the current
directory.  (\*(L".\*(R" will not be appended if taint checks are enabled,
either by \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR or by \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR.)  If you need to modify this at runtime,

You can also insert hooks into the file inclusion system by putting Perl
code directly into \f(CW@INC\fR.  Those hooks may be subroutine references,
array references or blessed objects.  See \*(L"require\*(R" in perlfunc for details.
.ie n .IP "%INC" 8

you specified (with module names converted to pathnames), and the
value is the location of the file found.  The \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR
operator uses this hash to determine whether a particular file has
already been included.
.Sp
If the file was loaded via a hook (e.g. a subroutine reference, see
\&\*(L"require\*(R" in perlfunc for a description of these hooks), this hook is
by default inserted into \f(CW%INC\fR in place of a filename.  Note, however,

The hash \f(CW%SIG\fR contains signal handlers for signals.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    sub handler {   # 1st argument is signal name
\&        my($sig) = @_;
\&        print "Caught a SIG$sig\-\-shutting down\en";
\&        close(LOG);
\&        exit(0);
\&        }

\&    ...
\&    $SIG{\*(AqINT\*(Aq}  = \*(AqDEFAULT\*(Aq;   # restore default action
\&    $SIG{\*(AqQUIT\*(Aq} = \*(AqIGNORE\*(Aq;    # ignore SIGQUIT
.Ve
.Sp
Using a value of \f(CW\*(AqIGNORE\*(Aq\fR usually has the effect of ignoring the
signal, except for the \f(CW\*(C`CHLD\*(C'\fR signal.  See perlipc for more about
this special case.
.Sp
Here are some other examples:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    $SIG{"PIPE"} = "Plumber";   # assumes main::Plumber (not
\&                                # recommended)
\&    $SIG{"PIPE"} = \e&Plumber;   # just fine; assume current
\&                                # Plumber
\&    $SIG{"PIPE"} = *Plumber;    # somewhat esoteric
\&    $SIG{"PIPE"} = Plumber();   # oops, what did Plumber()
\&                                # return??
.Ve
.Sp
Be sure not to use a bareword as the name of a signal handler,
lest you inadvertently call it.
.Sp
If your system has the \f(CW\*(C`sigaction()\*(C'\fR function then signal handlers
are installed using it.  This means you get reliable signal handling.
.Sp
The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl 5.8.0 from
immediate (also known as \*(L"unsafe\*(R") to deferred, also known as \*(L"safe
signals\*(R".  See perlipc for more information.
.Sp
Certain internal hooks can be also set using the \f(CW%SIG\fR hash.  The
routine indicated by \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR is called when a warning
message is about to be printed.  The warning message is passed as the
first argument.  The presence of a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_WARN_\|_\*(C'\fR hook causes the
ordinary printing of warnings to \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR to be suppressed.  You can
use this to save warnings in a variable, or turn warnings into fatal
errors, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    local $SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_} = sub { die $_[0] };
\&    eval $proggie;
.Ve
.Sp
As the \f(CW\*(AqIGNORE\*(Aq\fR hook is not supported by \f(CW\*(C`_\|_WARN_\|_\*(C'\fR, you can
disable warnings using the empty subroutine:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    local $SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_} = sub {};
.Ve
.Sp
The routine indicated by \f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR is called when a fatal
exception is about to be thrown.  The error message is passed as the
first argument.  When a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR hook routine returns, the exception
processing continues as it would have in the absence of the hook,
unless the hook routine itself exits via a \f(CW\*(C`goto &sub\*(C'\fR, a loop exit,
or a \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR.  The \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR handler is explicitly disabled during
the call, so that you can die from a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR handler.  Similarly
for \f(CW\*(C`_\|_WARN_\|_\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Due to an implementation glitch, the \f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR hook is called
even inside an \f(CW\*(C`eval()\*(C'\fR.  Do not use this to rewrite a pending
exception in \f(CW$@\fR, or as a bizarre substitute for overriding
\&\f(CW\*(C`CORE::GLOBAL::die()\*(C'\fR.  This strange action at a distance may be fixed
in a future release so that \f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR is only called if your
program is about to exit, as was the original intent.  Any other use is
deprecated.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`_\|_WARN_\|_\*(C'\fR handlers are very special in one respect: they
may be called to report (probable) errors found by the parser.  In such
a case the parser may be in inconsistent state, so any attempt to
evaluate Perl code from such a handler will probably result in a
segfault.  This means that warnings or errors that result from parsing
Perl should be used with extreme caution, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    require Carp if defined $^S;
\&    Carp::confess("Something wrong") if defined &Carp::confess;
\&    die "Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give "
\&      . "backtrace...\en\et"
\&      . "To see backtrace try starting Perl with \-MCarp switch";
.Ve
.Sp
Here the first line will load \f(CW\*(C`Carp\*(C'\fR \fIunless\fR it is the parser who
called the handler.  The second line will print backtrace and die if
\&\f(CW\*(C`Carp\*(C'\fR was available.  The third line will be executed only if \f(CW\*(C`Carp\*(C'\fR was
not available.
.Sp
Having to even think about the \f(CW$^S\fR variable in your exception
handlers is simply wrong.  \f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR as currently implemented
invites grievous and difficult to track down errors.  Avoid it
and use an \f(CW\*(C`END{}\*(C'\fR or CORE::GLOBAL::die override instead.
.Sp

This variable first appeared in perl 5.6.0; earlier versions of perl

as a v\-string.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$^V\fR can be used to determine whether the Perl interpreter executing
a script is in the right range of versions.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    warn "Hashes not randomized!\en" if !$^V or $^V lt v5.8.1
.Ve
.Sp
To convert \f(CW$^V\fR into its string representation use \f(CW\*(C`sprintf()\*(C'\fR's
\&\f(CW"%vd"\fR conversion:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    printf "version is v%vd\en", $^V;  # Perl\*(Aqs version

If this variable is set to a true value, then \f(CW\*(C`stat()\*(C'\fR on Windows will

The name used to execute the current copy of Perl, from C's
\&\f(CW\*(C`argv[0]\*(C'\fR or (where supported) \fI/proc/self/exe\fR.
.Sp
Depending on the host operating system, the value of \f(CW$^X\fR may be
a relative or absolute pathname of the perl program file, or may
be the string used to invoke perl but not the pathname of the
perl program file.  Also, most operating systems permit invoking
programs that are not in the \s-1PATH\s0 environment variable, so there
is no guarantee that the value of \f(CW$^X\fR is in \s-1PATH\s0.  For \s-1VMS\s0, the
value may or may not include a version number.
.Sp
You usually can use the value of \f(CW$^X\fR to re-invoke an independent
copy of the same perl that is currently running, e.g.,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @first_run = \`$^X \-le "print int rand 100 for 1..100"\`;
.Ve
.Sp
But recall that not all operating systems support forking or
capturing of the output of commands, so this complex statement
may not be portable.
.Sp
It is not safe to use the value of \f(CW$^X\fR as a path name of a file,
as some operating systems that have a mandatory suffix on
executable files do not require use of the suffix when invoking
a command.  To convert the value of \f(CW$^X\fR to a path name, use the
following statements:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    # Build up a set of file names (not command names).
\&    use Config;
\&    my $this_perl = $^X;
\&    if ($^O ne \*(AqVMS\*(Aq) {
\&        $this_perl .= $Config{_exe}
\&          unless $this_perl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Because many operating systems permit anyone with read access to
the Perl program file to make a copy of it, patch the copy, and
then execute the copy, the security-conscious Perl programmer
should take care to invoke the installed copy of perl, not the
copy referenced by \f(CW$^X\fR.  The following statements accomplish
this goal, and produce a pathname that can be invoked as a
command or referenced as a file.
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    use Config;
\&    my $secure_perl_path = $Config{perlpath};
\&    if ($^O ne \*(AqVMS\*(Aq) {
\&        $secure_perl_path .= $Config{_exe}
\&            unless $secure_perl_path =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;
\&        }
.Ve
.SS "Variables related to regular expressions"
.IX Subsection "Variables related to regular expressions"
Most of the special variables related to regular expressions are side
effects.  Perl sets these variables when it has a successful match, so
you should check the match result before using them.  For instance:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    if( /P(A)TT(ER)N/ ) {
\&        print "I found $1 and $2\en";
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
These variables are read-only and dynamically-scoped, unless we note
otherwise.
.PP
The dynamic nature of the regular expression variables means that
their value is limited to the block that they are in, as demonstrated
by this bit of code:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $outer = \*(AqWallace and Grommit\*(Aq;
\&    my $inner = \*(AqMutt and Jeff\*(Aq;
\&
\&    my $pattern = qr/(\eS+) and (\eS+)/;
\&
\&    sub show_n { print "\e$1 is $1; \e$2 is $2\en" }
\&
\&    {
\&    OUTER:
\&        show_n() if $outer =~ m/$pattern/;
\&
\&        INNER: {
\&            show_n() if $inner =~ m/$pattern/;
\&            }
\&
\&        show_n();
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The output shows that while in the \f(CW\*(C`OUTER\*(C'\fR block, the values of \f(CW$1\fR
and \f(CW$2\fR are from the match against \f(CW$outer\fR.  Inside the \f(CW\*(C`INNER\*(C'\fR
block, the values of \f(CW$1\fR and \f(CW$2\fR are from the match against
\&\f(CW$inner\fR, but only until the end of the block (i.e. the dynamic
scope).  After the \f(CW\*(C`INNER\*(C'\fR block completes, the values of \f(CW$1\fR and
\&\f(CW$2\fR return to the values for the match against \f(CW$outer\fR even though
we have not made another match:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit
\&    $1 is Mutt; $2 is Jeff
\&    $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit
.Ve
.PP
Due to an unfortunate accident of Perl's implementation, \f(CW\*(C`use
English\*(C'\fR imposes a considerable performance penalty on all regular
expression matches in a program because it uses the \f(CW\*(C`$\`\*(C'\fR, \f(CW$&\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`$\*(Aq\*(C'\fR, regardless of whether they occur in the scope of \f(CW\*(C`use
English\*(C'\fR.  For that reason, saying \f(CW\*(C`use English\*(C'\fR in libraries is
strongly discouraged unless you import it without the match variables:

\&\f(CW\*(C`${^PREMATCH}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`${^MATCH}\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`${^POSTMATCH}\*(C'\fR variables instead
so you only suffer the performance penalties.

The string following whatever was matched by the last successful

The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a considerable

To avoid this penalty, you can extract the same substring by
using \*(L"@\-\*(R".  Starting with Perl 5.10, you can use the \f(CW\*(C`/p\*(C'\fR match flag
and the \f(CW\*(C`${^POSTMATCH}\*(C'\fR variable to do the same thing for particular
match operations.

.SS "Variables related to filehandles"
.IX Subsection "Variables related to filehandles"
Variables that depend on the currently selected filehandle may be set
by calling an appropriate object method on the \f(CW\*(C`IO::Handle\*(C'\fR object,
although this is less efficient than using the regular built-in
variables.  (Summary lines below for this contain the word \s-1HANDLE\s0.)
First you must say
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use IO::Handle;
.Ve
.PP
after which you may use either
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    method HANDLE EXPR
.Ve
.PP
or more safely,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    HANDLE\->method(EXPR)
.Ve
.PP
Each method returns the old value of the \f(CW\*(C`IO::Handle\*(C'\fR attribute.  The
methods each take an optional \s-1EXPR\s0, which, if supplied, specifies the
new value for the \f(CW\*(C`IO::Handle\*(C'\fR attribute in question.  If not
supplied, most methods do nothing to the current value\*(--except for
\&\f(CW\*(C`autoflush()\*(C'\fR, which will assume a 1 for you, just to be different.
.PP
Because loading in the \f(CW\*(C`IO::Handle\*(C'\fR class is an expensive operation,
you should learn how to use the regular built-in variables.
.PP
A few of these variables are considered \*(L"read-only\*(R".  This means that
if you try to assign to this variable, either directly or indirectly
through a reference, you'll raise a run-time exception.
.PP
You should be very careful when modifying the default values of most
special variables described in this document.  In most cases you want
to localize these variables before changing them, since if you don't,
the change may affect other modules which rely on the default values
of the special variables that you have changed.  This is one of the
correct ways to read the whole file at once:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    open my $fh, "<", "foo" or die $!;
\&    local $/; # enable localized slurp mode
\&    my $content = <$fh>;
\&    close $fh;
.Ve
.PP
But the following code is quite bad:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    open my $fh, "<", "foo" or die $!;
\&    undef $/; # enable slurp mode
\&    my $content = <$fh>;
\&    close $fh;
.Ve
.PP
since some other module, may want to read data from some file in the
default \*(L"line mode\*(R", so if the code we have just presented has been
executed, the global value of \f(CW$/\fR is now changed for any other code
running inside the same Perl interpreter.
.PP
Usually when a variable is localized you want to make sure that this
change affects the shortest scope possible.  So unless you are already
inside some short \f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR block, you should create one yourself.  For
example:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    my $content = \*(Aq\*(Aq;
\&    open my $fh, "<", "foo" or die $!;
\&    {
\&        local $/;
\&        $content = <$fh>;
\&    }
\&    close $fh;
.Ve
.PP
Here is an example of how your own code can go broken:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    for ( 1..3 ){
\&        $\e = "\er\en";
\&        nasty_break();
\&        print "$_";
\&    }
\&
\&    sub nasty_break {
\&        $\e = "\ef";
\&        # do something with $_
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
You probably expect this code to print the equivalent of
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    "1\er\en2\er\en3\er\en"
.Ve
.PP
but instead you get:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    "1\ef2\ef3\ef"
.Ve
.PP
Why? Because \f(CW\*(C`nasty_break()\*(C'\fR modifies \f(CW\*(C`$\e\*(C'\fR without localizing it
first.  The value you set in  \f(CW\*(C`nasty_break()\*(C'\fR is still there when you
return.  The fix is to add \f(CW\*(C`local()\*(C'\fR so the value doesn't leak out of
\&\f(CW\*(C`nasty_break()\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    local $\e = "\ef";
.Ve
.PP
It's easy to notice the problem in such a short example, but in more
complicated code you are looking for trouble if you don't localize
changes to the special variables.

Each filehandle in Perl counts the number of lines that have been read

constitutes a line may not match yours.)  When a line is read from a
filehandle (via \f(CW\*(C`readline()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR), or when \f(CW\*(C`tell()\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`seek()\*(C'\fR is called on it, \f(CW$.\fR becomes an alias to the line counter
for that filehandle.
.Sp
You can adjust the counter by assigning to \f(CW$.\fR, but this will not
actually move the seek pointer.  \fILocalizing \f(CI$.\fI will not localize
the filehandle's line count\fR.  Instead, it will localize perl's notion
of which filehandle \f(CW$.\fR is currently aliased to.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$.\fR is reset when the filehandle is closed, but \fBnot\fR when an open
filehandle is reopened without an intervening \f(CW\*(C`close()\*(C'\fR.  For more
details, see \*(L"I/O Operators\*(R" in perlop.  Because \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR never does
an explicit close, line numbers increase across \f(CW\*(C`ARGV\*(C'\fR files (but see
examples in \*(L"eof\*(R" in perlfunc).

You can also use \f(CW\*(C`HANDLE\->input_line_number(EXPR)\*(C'\fR to access the

treating empty lines as a terminator if set to the null string (an
empty line cannot contain any spaces or tabs).  You may set it to a
multi-character string to match a multi-character terminator, or to
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR to read through the end of file.  Setting it to \f(CW"\en\en"\fR
means something slightly different than setting to \f(CW""\fR, if the file
contains consecutive empty lines.  Setting to \f(CW""\fR will treat two or
more consecutive empty lines as a single empty line.  Setting to
\&\f(CW"\en\en"\fR will blindly assume that the next input character belongs to
the next paragraph, even if it's a newline.

not reading from a record-oriented file (or your \s-1OS\s0 doesn't have
record-oriented files), then you'll likely get a full chunk of data
with every read.  If a record is larger than the record size you've
set, you'll get the record back in pieces.  Trying to set the record
size to zero or less will cause reading in the (rest of the) whole file.
.Sp
On \s-1VMS\s0 only, record reads bypass PerlIO layers and any associated
buffering,so you must not mix record and non-record reads on the
same filehandle.  Record mode mixes with line mode only when the
same buffering layer is in use for both modes.
.Sp
If you perform a record read on a \s-1FILE\s0 with an encoding layer such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`:encoding(latin1)\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR, you may get an invalid string as a
result, may leave the \s-1FILE\s0 positioned between characters in the stream
and may not be reading the number of bytes from the underlying file
that you specified.  This behaviour may change without warning in a
future version of perl.

flush after each write).  \s-1STDOUT\s0 will typically be line buffered if
output is to the terminal and block buffered otherwise.  Setting this
variable is useful primarily when you are outputting to a pipe or
socket, such as when you are running a Perl program under \fBrsh\fR and
want to see the output as it's happening.  This has no effect on input
buffering.  See \*(L"getc\*(R" in perlfunc for that.  See \*(L"select\*(R" in perlfunc on

.SS "Error Variables"
.IX Xref "error exception"
.IX Subsection "Error Variables"
The variables \f(CW$@\fR, \f(CW$!\fR, \f(CW$^E\fR, and \f(CW$?\fR contain information
about different types of error conditions that may appear during
execution of a Perl program.  The variables are shown ordered by
the \*(L"distance\*(R" between the subsystem which reported the error and
the Perl process.  They correspond to errors detected by the Perl
interpreter, C library, operating system, or an external program,
respectively.
.PP
To illustrate the differences between these variables, consider the
following Perl expression, which uses a single-quoted string.  After
execution of this statement, perl may have set all four special error
variables:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    eval q{
\&        open my $pipe, "/cdrom/install |" or die $!;
\&        my @res = <$pipe>;
\&        close $pipe or die "bad pipe: $?, $!";
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
When perl executes the \f(CW\*(C`eval()\*(C'\fR expression, it translates the
\&\f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`<PIPE>\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR calls in the C run-time library
and thence to the operating system kernel.  perl sets \f(CW$!\fR to
the C library's \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR if one of these calls fails.
.PP
\&\f(CW$@\fR is set if the string to be \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR\-ed did not compile (this may
happen if \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR were imported with bad prototypes), or
if Perl code executed during evaluation \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fRd.  In these cases the
value of \f(CW$@\fR is the compile error, or the argument to \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR (which
will interpolate \f(CW$!\fR and \f(CW$?\fR).  (See also Fatal, though.)
.PP
Under a few operating systems, \f(CW$^E\fR may contain a more verbose error
indicator, such as in this case, \*(L"\s-1CDROM\s0 tray not closed.\*(R"  Systems that
do not support extended error messages leave \f(CW$^E\fR the same as \f(CW$!\fR.
.PP
Finally, \f(CW$?\fR may be set to non\-0 value if the external program
\&\fI/cdrom/install\fR fails.  The upper eight bits reflect specific error
conditions encountered by the program (the program's \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR value).
The lower eight bits reflect mode of failure, like signal death and
core dump information.  See \fIwait\fR\|(2) for details.  In contrast to
\&\f(CW$!\fR and \f(CW$^E\fR, which are set only if error condition is detected,
the variable \f(CW$?\fR is set on each \f(CW\*(C`wait\*(C'\fR or pipe \f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR,
overwriting the old value.  This is more like \f(CW$@\fR, which on every
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval()\*(C'\fR is always set on failure and cleared on success.
.PP
For more details, see the individual descriptions at \f(CW$@\fR, \f(CW$!\fR,
\&\f(CW$^E\fR, and \f(CW$?\fR.

command, successful call to \f(CW\*(C`wait()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`waitpid()\*(C'\fR, or from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR operator.  On POSIX-like systems this value can be decoded

Error information specific to the current operating system.  At the
moment, this differs from \f(CW$!\fR under only \s-1VMS\s0, \s-1OS/2\s0, and Win32 (and
for MacPerl).  On all other platforms, \f(CW$^E\fR is always just the same
as \f(CW$!\fR.
.Sp
Under \s-1VMS\s0, \f(CW$^E\fR provides the \s-1VMS\s0 status value from the last system
error.  This is more specific information about the last system error
than that provided by \f(CW$!\fR.  This is particularly important when \f(CW$!\fR
is set to \fB\s-1EVMSERR\s0\fR.
.Sp
Under \s-1OS/2\s0, \f(CW$^E\fR is set to the error code of the last call to \s-1OS/2\s0
\&\s-1API\s0 either via \s-1CRT\s0, or directly from perl.
.Sp
Under Win32, \f(CW$^E\fR always returns the last error information reported
by the Win32 call \f(CW\*(C`GetLastError()\*(C'\fR which describes the last error
from within the Win32 \s-1API\s0.  Most Win32\-specific code will report errors
via \f(CW$^E\fR.  \s-1ANSI\s0 C and Unix-like calls set \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR and so most
portable Perl code will report errors via \f(CW$!\fR.

When referenced, \f(CW$!\fR retrieves the current value
of the C \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR integer variable.
If \f(CW$!\fR is assigned a numerical value, that value is stored in \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR.
When referenced as a string, \f(CW$!\fR yields the system error string
corresponding to \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Many system or library calls set \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR if they fail,
to indicate the cause of failure.  They usually do \fBnot\fR
set \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR to zero if they succeed.  This means \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR,
hence \f(CW$!\fR, is meaningful only \fIimmediately\fR after a \fBfailure\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 11

\&    }
\&    # Since here we might have either success or failure,
\&    # $! is meaningless.
.Ve
.Sp
Here, \fImeaningless\fR means that \f(CW$!\fR may be unrelated to the outcome
of the \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR operator.  Assignment to \f(CW$!\fR is similarly ephemeral.
It can be used immediately before invoking the \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR operator,
to set the exit value, or to inspect the system error string
corresponding to error \fIn\fR, or to restore \f(CW$!\fR to a meaningful state.

successful call to \f(CW\*(C`wait()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`waitpid()\*(C'\fR, or from the \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR
operator.  This is just the 16\-bit status word returned by the
traditional Unix \f(CW\*(C`wait()\*(C'\fR system call (or else is made up to look
like it).  Thus, the exit value of the subprocess is really (\f(CW\*(C`$? >>
8\*(C'\fR), and \f(CW\*(C`$? & 127\*(C'\fR gives which signal, if any, the process died
from, and \f(CW\*(C`$? & 128\*(C'\fR reports whether there was a core dump.

Additionally, if the \f(CW\*(C`h_errno\*(C'\fR variable is supported in C, its value
is returned via \f(CW$?\fR if any \f(CW\*(C`gethost*()\*(C'\fR function fails.
.Sp
If you have installed a signal handler for \f(CW\*(C`SIGCHLD\*(C'\fR, the

.Sp
Inside an \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR subroutine \f(CW$?\fR contains the value that is going to be
given to \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR.  You can modify \f(CW$?\fR in an \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR subroutine to
change the exit status of your program.  For example:

Also note that there's no value for UNITCHECK-blocks.  That's because
those are run for each compilation unit individually, and therefore is
not a global interpreter phase.
.Sp
Not every program has to go through each of the possible phases, but
transition from one phase to another can only happen in the order
described in the above list.
.Sp
An example of all of the phases Perl code can see:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    BEGIN { print "compile\-time: ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\en" }
\&
\&    INIT  { print "init\-time: ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\en" }

.IP "$^H" 8
.IX Xref "$^H"
.IX Item "$^H"
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0 This variable is strictly for
internal use only.  Its availability,
behavior, and contents are subject to change without notice.
.Sp
This variable contains compile-time hints for the Perl interpreter.  At the
end of compilation of a \s-1BLOCK\s0 the value of this variable is restored to the
value when the interpreter started to compile the \s-1BLOCK\s0.
.Sp
When perl begins to parse any block construct that provides a lexical scope
(e.g., eval body, required file, subroutine body, loop body, or conditional
block), the existing value of \f(CW$^H\fR is saved, but its value is left unchanged.
When the compilation of the block is completed, it regains the saved value.
Between the points where its value is saved and restored, code that
executes within \s-1BEGIN\s0 blocks is free to change the value of \f(CW$^H\fR.
.Sp
This behavior provides the semantic of lexical scoping, and is used in,
for instance, the \f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR pragma.
.Sp
The contents should be an integer; different bits of it are used for
different pragmatic flags.  Here's an example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub add_100 { $^H |= 0x100 }
\&
\&    sub foo {
\&        BEGIN { add_100() }
\&        bar\->baz($boon);
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Consider what happens during execution of the \s-1BEGIN\s0 block.  At this point
the \s-1BEGIN\s0 block has already been compiled, but the body of \f(CW\*(C`foo()\*(C'\fR is still
being compiled.  The new value of \f(CW$^H\fR
will therefore be visible only while
the body of \f(CW\*(C`foo()\*(C'\fR is being compiled.
.Sp
Substitution of \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN { add_100() }\*(C'\fR block with:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    BEGIN { require strict; strict\->import(\*(Aqvars\*(Aq) }
.Ve
.Sp
demonstrates how \f(CW\*(C`use strict \*(Aqvars\*(Aq\*(C'\fR is implemented.  Here's a conditional
version of the same lexical pragma:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    BEGIN {
\&        require strict; strict\->import(\*(Aqvars\*(Aq) if $condition
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
This variable was added in Perl 5.003.
.IP "%^H" 8
.IX Xref "%^H"
.IX Item "%^H"
The \f(CW\*(C`%^H\*(C'\fR hash provides the same scoping semantic as \f(CW$^H\fR.  This makes
it useful for implementation of lexically scoped pragmas.  See
perlpragma.
.Sp
When putting items into \f(CW\*(C`%^H\*(C'\fR, in order to avoid conflicting with other
users of the hash there is a convention regarding which keys to use.
A module should use only keys that begin with the module's name (the
name of its main package) and a \*(L"/\*(R" character.  For example, a module
\&\f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar\*(C'\fR should use keys such as \f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar/baz\*(C'\fR.

This variable stores the index of the first element in an array, and
of the first character in a substring.  The default is 0, but you could
theoretically set it to 1 to make Perl behave more like \fBawk\fR (or Fortran)
when subscripting and when evaluating the \fIindex()\fR and \fIsubstr()\fR functions.
.Sp
As of release 5 of Perl, assignment to \f(CW$[\fR is treated as a compiler
directive, and cannot influence the behavior of any other file.
(That's why you can only assign compile-time constants to it.)
Its use is highly discouraged.
.Sp
Prior to Perl 5.10, assignment to \f(CW$[\fR could be seen from outer lexical
scopes in the same file, unlike other compile-time directives (such as
strict).  Using \fIlocal()\fR on it would bind its value strictly to a lexical
block.  Now it is always lexically scoped.
.Sp
As of Perl 5.16, it is implemented by the arybase module.  See
arybase for more details on its behaviour.
.Sp
Under \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`no feature "array_base"\*(C'\fR, \f(CW$[\fR no longer has any
effect, and always contains 0.  Assigning 0 to it is permitted, but any
other value will produce an error.

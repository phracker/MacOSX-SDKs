perlperf \- Perl Performance and Optimization Techniques
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is an introduction to the use of performance and optimization techniques
which can be used with particular reference to perl programs.  While many perl
developers have come from other languages, and can use their prior knowledge
where appropriate, there are many other people who might benefit from a few
perl specific pointers.  If you want the condensed version, perhaps the best
advice comes from the renowned Japanese Samurai, Miyamoto Musashi, who said:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    "Do Not Engage in Useless Activity"
.Ve
.PP
in 1645.
.SH "OVERVIEW"
.IX Header "OVERVIEW"
Perhaps the most common mistake programmers make is to attempt to optimize
their code before a program actually does anything useful \- this is a bad idea.
There's no point in having an extremely fast program that doesn't work.  The
first job is to get a program to \fIcorrectly\fR do something \fBuseful\fR, (not to
mention ensuring the test suite is fully functional), and only then to consider
optimizing it.  Having decided to optimize existing working code, there are
several simple but essential steps to consider which are intrinsic to any
optimization process.
.SS "\s-1ONE\s0 \s-1STEP\s0 \s-1SIDEWAYS\s0"
.IX Subsection "ONE STEP SIDEWAYS"
Firstly, you need to establish a baseline time for the existing code, which
timing needs to be reliable and repeatable.  You'll probably want to use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Benchmark\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Devel::NYTProf\*(C'\fR modules, or something similar, for this step,
or perhaps the Unix system \f(CW\*(C`time\*(C'\fR utility, whichever is appropriate.  See the
base of this document for a longer list of benchmarking and profiling modules,
and recommended further reading.
.SS "\s-1ONE\s0 \s-1STEP\s0 \s-1FORWARD\s0"
.IX Subsection "ONE STEP FORWARD"
Next, having examined the program for \fIhot spots\fR, (places where the code
seems to run slowly), change the code with the intention of making it run
faster.  Using version control software, like \f(CW\*(C`subversion\*(C'\fR, will ensure no
changes are irreversible.  It's too easy to fiddle here and fiddle there \-
don't change too much at any one time or you might not discover which piece of
code \fBreally\fR was the slow bit.
.SS "\s-1ANOTHER\s0 \s-1STEP\s0 \s-1SIDEWAYS\s0"
.IX Subsection "ANOTHER STEP SIDEWAYS"
It's not enough to say: \*(L"that will make it run faster\*(R", you have to check it.
Rerun the code under control of the benchmarking or profiling modules, from the
first step above, and check that the new code executed the \fBsame task\fR in
\&\fIless time\fR.  Save your work and repeat...
.SH "GENERAL GUIDELINES"
.IX Header "GENERAL GUIDELINES"
The critical thing when considering performance is to remember there is no such
thing as a \f(CW\*(C`Golden Bullet\*(C'\fR, which is why there are no rules, only guidelines.
.PP
It is clear that inline code is going to be faster than subroutine or method
calls, because there is less overhead, but this approach has the disadvantage
of being less maintainable and comes at the cost of greater memory usage \-
there is no such thing as a free lunch.  If you are searching for an element in
a list, it can be more efficient to store the data in a hash structure, and
then simply look to see whether the key is defined, rather than to loop through
the entire array using \fIgrep()\fR for instance.  \fIsubstr()\fR may be (a lot) faster
than \fIgrep()\fR but not as flexible, so you have another trade-off to access.  Your
code may contain a line which takes 0.01 of a second to execute which if you
call it 1,000 times, quite likely in a program parsing even medium sized files
for instance, you already have a 10 second delay, in just one single code
location, and if you call that line 100,000 times, your entire program will
slow down to an unbearable crawl.
.PP
Using a subroutine as part of your sort is a powerful way to get exactly what
you want, but will usually be slower than the built-in \fIalphabetic\fR \f(CW\*(C`cmp\*(C'\fR and
\&\fInumeric\fR \f(CW\*(C`<=>\*(C'\fR sort operators.  It is possible to make multiple
passes over your data, building indices to make the upcoming sort more
efficient, and to use what is known as the \f(CW\*(C`OM\*(C'\fR (Orcish Maneuver) to cache the
sort keys in advance.  The cache lookup, while a good idea, can itself be a
source of slowdown by enforcing a double pass over the data \- once to setup the
cache, and once to sort the data.  Using \f(CW\*(C`pack()\*(C'\fR to extract the required sort
key into a consistent string can be an efficient way to build a single string
to compare, instead of using multiple sort keys, which makes it possible to use
the standard, written in \f(CW\*(C`c\*(C'\fR and fast, perl \f(CW\*(C`sort()\*(C'\fR function on the output,
and is the basis of the \f(CW\*(C`GRT\*(C'\fR (Guttman Rossler Transform).  Some string
combinations can slow the \f(CW\*(C`GRT\*(C'\fR down, by just being too plain complex for it's
own good.
.PP
For applications using database backends, the standard \f(CW\*(C`DBIx\*(C'\fR namespace has
tries to help with keeping things nippy, not least because it tries to \fInot\fR
query the database until the latest possible moment, but always read the docs
which come with your choice of libraries.  Among the many issues facing
developers dealing with databases should remain aware of is to always use
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQL\*(C'\fR placeholders and to consider pre-fetching data sets when this might
prove advantageous.  Splitting up a large file by assigning multiple processes
to parsing a single file, using say \f(CW\*(C`POE\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`threads\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR can also be a
useful way of optimizing your usage of the available \f(CW\*(C`CPU\*(C'\fR resources, though
this technique is fraught with concurrency issues and demands high attention to
detail.
.PP
Every case has a specific application and one or more exceptions, and there is
no replacement for running a few tests and finding out which method works best
for your particular environment, this is why writing optimal code is not an
exact science, and why we love using Perl so much \- \s-1TMTOWTDI\s0.
.SH "BENCHMARKS"
.IX Header "BENCHMARKS"
Here are a few examples to demonstrate usage of Perl's benchmarking tools.
.SS "Assigning and Dereferencing Variables."
.IX Subsection "Assigning and Dereferencing Variables."
I'm sure most of us have seen code which looks like, (or worse than), this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    if ( $obj\->{_ref}\->{_myscore} >= $obj\->{_ref}\->{_yourscore} ) {
\&        ...
.Ve
.PP
This sort of code can be a real eyesore to read, as well as being very
sensitive to typos, and it's much clearer to dereference the variable
explicitly.  We're side-stepping the issue of working with object-oriented
programming techniques to encapsulate variable access via methods, only
accessible through an object.  Here we're just discussing the technical
implementation of choice, and whether this has an effect on performance.  We
can see whether this dereferencing operation, has any overhead by putting
comparative code in a file and running a \f(CW\*(C`Benchmark\*(C'\fR test.
.PP
# dereference
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
\&
\&    use strict;
\&    use warnings;
\&
\&    use Benchmark;
\&
\&    my $ref = {
\&            \*(Aqref\*(Aq   => {
\&                _myscore    => \*(Aq100 + 1\*(Aq,
\&                _yourscore  => \*(Aq102 \- 1\*(Aq,
\&            },
\&    };
\&
\&    timethese(1000000, {
\&            \*(Aqdirect\*(Aq       => sub {
\&                my $x = $ref\->{ref}\->{_myscore} . $ref\->{ref}\->{_yourscore} ;
\&            },
\&            \*(Aqdereference\*(Aq  => sub {
\&                my $ref  = $ref\->{ref};
\&                my $myscore = $ref\->{_myscore};
\&                my $yourscore = $ref\->{_yourscore};
\&                my $x = $myscore . $yourscore;
\&            },
\&    });
.Ve
.PP
It's essential to run any timing measurements a sufficient number of times so
the numbers settle on a numerical average, otherwise each run will naturally
fluctuate due to variations in the environment, to reduce the effect of
contention for \f(CW\*(C`CPU\*(C'\fR resources and network bandwidth for instance.  Running
the above code for one million iterations, we can take a look at the report
output by the \f(CW\*(C`Benchmark\*(C'\fR module, to see which approach is the most effective.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $> perl dereference
\&
\&    Benchmark: timing 1000000 iterations of dereference, direct...
\&    dereference:  2 wallclock secs ( 1.59 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.59 CPU) @ 628930.82/s (n=1000000)
\&        direct:  1 wallclock secs ( 1.20 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.20 CPU) @ 833333.33/s (n=1000000)
.Ve
.PP
The difference is clear to see and the dereferencing approach is slower.  While
it managed to execute an average of 628,930 times a second during our test, the
direct approach managed to run an additional 204,403 times, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, because there are many examples of code written using the
multiple layer direct variable access, and it's usually horrible.  It is,
however, minusculy faster.  The question remains whether the minute gain is
actually worth the eyestrain, or the loss of maintainability.
.SS "Search and replace or tr"
.IX Subsection "Search and replace or tr"
If we have a string which needs to be modified, while a regex will almost
always be much more flexible, \f(CW\*(C`tr\*(C'\fR, an oft underused tool, can still be a
useful.  One scenario might be replace all vowels with another character.  The
regex solution might look like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $str =~ s/[aeiou]/x/g
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`tr\*(C'\fR alternative might look like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $str =~ tr/aeiou/xxxxx/
.Ve
.PP
We can put that into a test file which we can run to check which approach is
the fastest, using a global \f(CW$STR\fR variable to assign to the \f(CW\*(C`my $str\*(C'\fR
variable so as to avoid perl trying to optimize any of the work away by
noticing it's assigned only the once.
.PP
# regex-transliterate
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
\&
\&    use strict;
\&    use warnings;
\&
\&    use Benchmark;
\&
\&    my $STR = "$$\-this and that";
\&
\&    timethese( 1000000, {
\&            \*(Aqsr\*(Aq  => sub { my $str = $STR; $str =~ s/[aeiou]/x/g; return $str; },
\&            \*(Aqtr\*(Aq  => sub { my $str = $STR; $str =~ tr/aeiou/xxxxx/; return $str; },
\&    });
.Ve
.PP
Running the code gives us our results:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $> perl regex\-transliterate
\&
\&    Benchmark: timing 1000000 iterations of sr, tr...
\&            sr:  2 wallclock secs ( 1.19 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.19 CPU) @ 840336.13/s (n=1000000)
\&            tr:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.49 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.49 CPU) @ 2040816.33/s (n=1000000)
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`tr\*(C'\fR version is a clear winner.  One solution is flexible, the other is
fast \- and it's appropriately the programmer's choice which to use.
.PP
Check the \f(CW\*(C`Benchmark\*(C'\fR docs for further useful techniques.

Interestingly we get slightly different results, which is mostly because the
algorithm which generates the report is different, even though the output file
format was allegedly identical.  The elapsed, user and system times are clearly
showing the time it took for \f(CW\*(C`Devel::Profiler\*(C'\fR to execute its own run, but
the column listings feel more accurate somehow than the ones we had earlier
from \f(CW\*(C`Devel::DProf\*(C'\fR.  The 102% figure has disappeared, for example.  This is
where we have to use the tools at our disposal, and recognise their pros and
cons, before using them.  Interestingly, the numbers of calls for each
subroutine are identical in the two reports, it's the percentages which differ.

You can immediately see a slightly different focus to the subroutine profiling
modules, and we start to see exactly which line of code is taking the most
time.  That regex line is looking a bit suspicious, for example.  Remember that
these tools are supposed to be used together, there is no single best way to
profile your code, you need to use the best tools for the job.

to execute, \f(CW\*(C`if ( $debug ) { \*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`my $message = shift;\*(C'\fR, for example.  The
differences in the actual times recorded might be in the algorithm used

At this point, if you're using the \fIhtml\fR report, you can click through the
various links to bore down into each subroutine and each line of code.  Because
we're using the text reporting here, and there's a whole directory full of
reports built for each source file, we'll just display a part of the
corresponding \fIwordmatch\-line.html\fR file, sufficient to give an idea of the
sort of output you can expect from this cool tool.

Oodles of very useful information in there \- this seems to be the way forward.

.SH "SORTING"
.IX Header "SORTING"
Perl modules are not the only tools a performance analyst has at their
disposal, system tools like \f(CW\*(C`time\*(C'\fR should not be overlooked as the next
example shows, where we take a quick look at sorting.  Many books, theses and
articles, have been written about efficient sorting algorithms, and this is not
the place to repeat such work, there's several good sorting modules which
deserve taking a look at too: \f(CW\*(C`Sort::Maker\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Sort::Key\*(C'\fR spring to mind.
However, it's still possible to make some observations on certain Perl specific
interpretations on issues relating to sorting data sets and give an example or
two with regard to how sorting large data volumes can effect performance.
Firstly, an often overlooked point when sorting large amounts of data, one can
attempt to reduce the data set to be dealt with and in many cases \f(CW\*(C`grep()\*(C'\fR can
be quite useful as a simple filter:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @data = sort grep { /$filter/ } @incoming
.Ve
.PP
A command such as this can vastly reduce the volume of material to actually
sort through in the first place, and should not be too lightly disregarded
purely on the basis of its simplicity.  The \f(CW\*(C`KISS\*(C'\fR principle is too often
overlooked \- the next example uses the simple system \f(CW\*(C`time\*(C'\fR utility to
demonstrate.  Let's take a look at an actual example of sorting the contents of
a large file, an apache logfile would do.  This one has over a quarter of a
million lines, is 50M in size, and a snippet of it looks like this:
.PP
# logfile

The overall, or wallclock, time between when \f(CW\*(C`time\*(C'\fR was called, and when it

.SH "LOGGING"
.IX Header "LOGGING"
An essential part of any good development process is appropriate error handling
with appropriately informative messages, however there exists a school of
thought which suggests that log files should be \fIchatty\fR, as if the chain of
unbroken output somehow ensures the survival of the program.  If speed is in
any way an issue, this approach is wrong.
.PP
A common sight is code which looks something like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    logger\->debug( "A logging message via process\-id: $$ INC: " . Dumper(\e%INC) )
.Ve
.PP
The problem is that this code will always be parsed and executed, even when the
debug level set in the logging configuration file is zero.  Once the \fIdebug()\fR
subroutine has been entered, and the internal \f(CW$debug\fR variable confirmed to
be zero, for example, the message which has been sent in will be discarded and
the program will continue.  In the example given though, the \e%INC hash will
already have been dumped, and the message string constructed, all of which work
could be bypassed by a debug variable at the statement level, like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    logger\->debug( "A logging message via process\-id: $$ INC: " . Dumper(\e%INC) ) if $DEBUG;
.Ve
.PP
This effect can be demonstrated by setting up a test script with both forms,
including a \f(CW\*(C`debug()\*(C'\fR subroutine to emulate typical \f(CW\*(C`logger()\*(C'\fR functionality.
.PP
# ifdebug
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
\&
\&    use strict;
\&    use warnings;

\&    my $DEBUG = 0;
\&
\&    sub debug {
\&        my $msg = shift;
\&
\&        if ( $DEBUG ) {
\&            print "DEBUG: $msg\en";
\&        }
\&    };
\&
\&    timethese(100000, {
\&            \*(Aqdebug\*(Aq       => sub {
\&                debug( "A $0 logging message via process\-id: $$" . Dumper(\e%INC) )
\&            },
\&            \*(Aqifdebug\*(Aq  => sub {
\&                debug( "A $0 logging message via process\-id: $$" . Dumper(\e%INC) ) if $DEBUG
\&            },
\&    });
.Ve
.PP
Let's see what \f(CW\*(C`Benchmark\*(C'\fR makes of this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    $> perl ifdebug
\&    Benchmark: timing 100000 iterations of constant, sub...
\&       ifdebug:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.01 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.01 CPU) @ 10000000.00/s (n=100000)
\&                (warning: too few iterations for a reliable count)
\&         debug: 14 wallclock secs (13.18 usr +  0.04 sys = 13.22 CPU) @ 7564.30/s (n=100000)
.Ve
.PP
In the one case the code, which does exactly the same thing as far as
outputting any debugging information is concerned, in other words nothing,
takes 14 seconds, and in the other case the code takes one hundredth of a
second.  Looks fairly definitive.  Use a \f(CW$DEBUG\fR variable \s-1BEFORE\s0 you call the
subroutine, rather than relying on the smart functionality inside it.
.SS "Logging if \s-1DEBUG\s0 (constant)"
.IX Subsection "Logging if DEBUG (constant)"
It's possible to take the previous idea a little further, by using a compile
time \f(CW\*(C`DEBUG\*(C'\fR constant.
.PP
# ifdebug-constant
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
\&
\&    use strict;
\&    use warnings;

\&    use Benchmark;

\&    use constant
\&        DEBUG => 0
\&    ;
\&
\&    sub debug {
\&        if ( DEBUG ) {
\&            my $msg = shift;
\&            print "DEBUG: $msg\en";
\&        }
\&    };
\&
\&    timethese(100000, {
\&            \*(Aqdebug\*(Aq       => sub {
\&                debug( "A $0 logging message via process\-id: $$" . Dumper(\e%INC) )
\&            },
\&            \*(Aqconstant\*(Aq  => sub {
\&                debug( "A $0 logging message via process\-id: $$" . Dumper(\e%INC) ) if DEBUG
\&            },
\&    });
.Ve
.PP
Running this program produces the following output:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    $> perl ifdebug\-constant
\&    Benchmark: timing 100000 iterations of constant, sub...
\&      constant:  0 wallclock secs (\-0.00 usr +  0.00 sys = \-0.00 CPU) @ \-7205759403792793600000.00/s (n=100000)
\&                (warning: too few iterations for a reliable count)
\&           sub: 14 wallclock secs (13.09 usr +  0.00 sys = 13.09 CPU) @ 7639.42/s (n=100000)
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`DEBUG\*(C'\fR constant wipes the floor with even the \f(CW$debug\fR variable,
clocking in at minus zero seconds, and generates a \*(L"warning: too few iterations
for a reliable count\*(R" message into the bargain.  To see what is really going
on, and why we had too few iterations when we thought we asked for 100000, we
can use the very useful \f(CW\*(C`B::Deparse\*(C'\fR to inspect the new code:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $> perl \-MO=Deparse ifdebug\-constant
\&
\&    use Benchmark;
\&    use Data::Dumper;
\&    use constant (\*(AqDEBUG\*(Aq, 0);
\&    sub debug {
\&        use warnings;
\&        use strict \*(Aqrefs\*(Aq;
\&        0;
\&    }
\&    use warnings;
\&    use strict \*(Aqrefs\*(Aq;
\&    timethese(100000, {\*(Aqsub\*(Aq, sub {
\&        debug "A $0 logging message via process\-id: $$" . Dumper(\e%INC);
\&    }
\&    , \*(Aqconstant\*(Aq, sub {
\&        0;
\&    }
\&    });
\&    ifdebug\-constant syntax OK
.Ve
.PP
The output shows the \fIconstant()\fR subroutine we're testing being replaced with
the value of the \f(CW\*(C`DEBUG\*(C'\fR constant: zero.  The line to be tested has been
completely optimized away, and you can't get much more efficient than that.

As a final thought, remember that it's not (at the time of writing) possible to
produce a useful program which will run in zero or negative time and this basic
principle can be written as: \fIuseful programs are slow\fR by their very
definition.  It is of course possible to write a nearly instantaneous program,
but it's not going to do very much, here's a very efficient one:

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm is a stable, complete and mature solution for processing and preparing
\&\s-1HTTP\s0 requests and responses.  Major features including processing form
submissions, file uploads, reading and writing cookies, query string generation
and manipulation, and processing and preparing \s-1HTTP\s0 headers. Some \s-1HTML\s0
generation utilities are included as well.
.PP
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm performs very well in in a vanilla \s-1CGI\s0.pm environment and also comes
with built-in support for mod_perl and mod_perl2 as well as FastCGI.
.PP
It has the benefit of having developed and refined over 10 years with input
from dozens of contributors and being deployed on thousands of websites.
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm has been included in the Perl distribution since Perl 5.4, and has
become a de-facto standard.
.SS "\s-1PROGRAMMING STYLE\s0"
.IX Subsection "PROGRAMMING STYLE"
There are two styles of programming with \s-1CGI\s0.pm, an object-oriented
style and a function-oriented style.  In the object-oriented style you
create one or more \s-1CGI\s0 objects and then use object methods to create
the various elements of the page.  Each \s-1CGI\s0 object starts out with the
list of named parameters that were passed to your \s-1CGI\s0 script by the
server.  You can modify the objects, save them to a file or database
and recreate them.  Because each object corresponds to the \*(L"state\*(R" of
the \s-1CGI\s0 script, and because each object's parameter list is
independent of the others, this allows you to save the state of the
script and restore it later.
.PP
For example, using the object oriented style, here is how you create
a simple \*(L"Hello World\*(R" \s-1HTML\s0 page:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&   #!/usr/local/bin/perl \-w
\&   use CGI;                             # load CGI routines
\&   $q = CGI\->new;                        # create new CGI object
\&   print $q\->header,                    # create the HTTP header
\&         $q\->start_html(\*(Aqhello world\*(Aq), # start the HTML
\&         $q\->h1(\*(Aqhello world\*(Aq),         # level 1 header
\&         $q\->end_html;                  # end the HTML
.Ve
.PP
In the function-oriented style, there is one default \s-1CGI\s0 object that
you rarely deal with directly.  Instead you just call functions to
retrieve \s-1CGI\s0 parameters, create \s-1HTML\s0 tags, manage cookies, and so
on.  This provides you with a cleaner programming interface, but
limits you to using one \s-1CGI\s0 object at a time.  The following example
prints the same page, but uses the function-oriented interface.
The main differences are that we now need to import a set of functions
into our name space (usually the \*(L"standard\*(R" functions), and we don't
need to create the \s-1CGI\s0 object.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&   #!/usr/local/bin/perl
\&   use CGI qw/:standard/;           # load standard CGI routines
\&   print header,                    # create the HTTP header
\&         start_html(\*(Aqhello world\*(Aq), # start the HTML
\&         h1(\*(Aqhello world\*(Aq),         # level 1 header
\&         end_html;                  # end the HTML
.Ve
.PP
The examples in this document mainly use the object-oriented style.
See \s-1HOW TO IMPORT FUNCTIONS\s0 for important information on
function-oriented programming in \s-1CGI\s0.pm
.SS "\s-1CALLING CGI.PM ROUTINES\s0"
.IX Subsection "CALLING CGI.PM ROUTINES"
Most \s-1CGI\s0.pm routines accept several arguments, sometimes as many as 20
optional ones!  To simplify this interface, all routines use a named
argument calling style that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   print $q\->header(\-type=>\*(Aqimage/gif\*(Aq,\-expires=>\*(Aq+3d\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Each argument name is preceded by a dash.  Neither case nor order
matters in the argument list.  \-type, \-Type, and \-TYPE are all
acceptable.  In fact, only the first argument needs to begin with a
dash.  If a dash is present in the first argument, \s-1CGI\s0.pm assumes
dashes for the subsequent ones.
.PP
Several routines are commonly called with just one argument.  In the
case of these routines you can provide the single argument without an
argument name.  \fIheader()\fR happens to be one of these routines.  In this
case, the single argument is the document type.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   print $q\->header(\*(Aqtext/html\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Other such routines are documented below.
.PP
Sometimes named arguments expect a scalar, sometimes a reference to an
array, and sometimes a reference to a hash.  Often, you can pass any
type of argument and the routine will do whatever is most appropriate.
For example, the \fIparam()\fR routine is used to set a \s-1CGI\s0 parameter to a
single or a multi-valued value.  The two cases are shown below:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   $q\->param(\-name=>\*(Aqveggie\*(Aq,\-value=>\*(Aqtomato\*(Aq);
\&   $q\->param(\-name=>\*(Aqveggie\*(Aq,\-value=>[\*(Aqtomato\*(Aq,\*(Aqtomahto\*(Aq,\*(Aqpotato\*(Aq,\*(Aqpotahto\*(Aq]);
.Ve
.PP
A large number of routines in \s-1CGI\s0.pm actually aren't specifically
defined in the module, but are generated automatically as needed.
These are the \*(L"\s-1HTML\s0 shortcuts,\*(R" routines that generate \s-1HTML\s0 tags for
use in dynamically-generated pages.  \s-1HTML\s0 tags have both attributes
(the attribute=\*(L"value\*(R" pairs within the tag itself) and contents (the
part between the opening and closing pairs.)  To distinguish between
attributes and contents, \s-1CGI\s0.pm uses the convention of passing \s-1HTML\s0
attributes as a hash reference as the first argument, and the
contents, if any, as any subsequent arguments.  It works out like
this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&   Code                           Generated HTML
\&   \-\-\-\-                           \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&   h1()                           <h1>
\&   h1(\*(Aqsome\*(Aq,\*(Aqcontents\*(Aq);         <h1>some contents</h1>
\&   h1({\-align=>left});            <h1 align="LEFT">
\&   h1({\-align=>left},\*(Aqcontents\*(Aq); <h1 align="LEFT">contents</h1>
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1HTML\s0 tags are described in more detail later.
.PP
Many newcomers to \s-1CGI\s0.pm are puzzled by the difference between the
calling conventions for the \s-1HTML\s0 shortcuts, which require curly braces
around the \s-1HTML\s0 tag attributes, and the calling conventions for other
routines, which manage to generate attributes without the curly
brackets.  Don't be confused.  As a convenience the curly braces are
optional in all but the \s-1HTML\s0 shortcuts.  If you like, you can use
curly braces when calling any routine that takes named arguments.  For
example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   print $q\->header( {\-type=>\*(Aqimage/gif\*(Aq,\-expires=>\*(Aq+3d\*(Aq} );
.Ve
.PP
If you use the \fB\-w\fR switch, you will be warned that some \s-1CGI\s0.pm argument
names conflict with built-in Perl functions.  The most frequent of
these is the \-values argument, used to create multi-valued menus,
radio button clusters and the like.  To get around this warning, you
have several choices:
.IP "1." 4
Use another name for the argument, if one is available. 
For example, \-value is an alias for \-values.
.IP "2." 4
Change the capitalization, e.g. \-Values
.IP "3." 4
Put quotes around the argument name, e.g. '\-values'
.PP
Many routines will do something useful with a named argument that it
doesn't recognize.  For example, you can produce non-standard \s-1HTTP\s0
header fields by providing them as named arguments:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  print $q\->header(\-type  =>  \*(Aqtext/html\*(Aq,
\&                   \-cost  =>  \*(AqThree smackers\*(Aq,
\&                   \-annoyance_level => \*(Aqhigh\*(Aq,
\&                   \-complaints_to   => \*(Aqbit bucket\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
This will produce the following nonstandard \s-1HTTP\s0 header:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   HTTP/1.0 200 OK
\&   Cost: Three smackers
\&   Annoyance\-level: high
\&   Complaints\-to: bit bucket
\&   Content\-type: text/html
.Ve
.PP
Notice the way that underscores are translated automatically into
hyphens.  HTML-generating routines perform a different type of
translation.
.PP
This feature allows you to keep up with the rapidly changing \s-1HTTP\s0 and
\&\s-1HTML \s0\*(L"standards\*(R".
.SS "\s-1CREATING A NEW QUERY OBJECT \s0(OBJECT-ORIENTED \s-1STYLE\s0):"
.IX Subsection "CREATING A NEW QUERY OBJECT (OBJECT-ORIENTED STYLE):"
.Vb 1
\&     $query = CGI\->new;
.Ve
.PP
This will parse the input (from \s-1POST, GET\s0 and \s-1DELETE\s0 methods) and store
it into a perl5 object called \f(CW$query\fR.
.PP
Any filehandles from file uploads will have their position reset to 
the beginning of the file.
.SS "\s-1CREATING A NEW QUERY OBJECT FROM AN INPUT FILE\s0"
.IX Subsection "CREATING A NEW QUERY OBJECT FROM AN INPUT FILE"
.Vb 1
\&     $query = CGI\->new(INPUTFILE);
.Ve
.PP
If you provide a file handle to the \fInew()\fR method, it will read
parameters from the file (or \s-1STDIN,\s0 or whatever).  The file can be in
any of the forms describing below under debugging (i.e. a series of
newline delimited TAG=VALUE pairs will work).  Conveniently, this type
of file is created by the \fIsave()\fR method (see below).  Multiple records
can be saved and restored.
.PP
Perl purists will be pleased to know that this syntax accepts
references to file handles, or even references to filehandle globs,
which is the \*(L"official\*(R" way to pass a filehandle:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $query = CGI\->new(\e*STDIN);
.Ve
.PP
You can also initialize the \s-1CGI\s0 object with a FileHandle or IO::File
object.
.PP
If you are using the function-oriented interface and want to
initialize \s-1CGI\s0 state from a file handle, the way to do this is with
\&\fB\f(BIrestore_parameters()\fB\fR.  This will (re)initialize the
default \s-1CGI\s0 object from the indicated file handle.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    open (IN,"test.in") || die;
\&    restore_parameters(IN);
\&    close IN;
.Ve
.PP
You can also initialize the query object from a hash
reference:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $query = CGI\->new( {\*(Aqdinosaur\*(Aq=>\*(Aqbarney\*(Aq,
\&                       \*(Aqsong\*(Aq=>\*(AqI love you\*(Aq,
\&                       \*(Aqfriends\*(Aq=>[qw/Jessica George Nancy/]}
\&                    );
.Ve
.PP
or from a properly formatted, URL-escaped query string:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $query = CGI\->new(\*(Aqdinosaur=barney&color=purple\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
or from a previously existing \s-1CGI\s0 object (currently this clones the
parameter list, but none of the other object-specific fields, such as
autoescaping):
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $old_query = CGI\->new;
\&    $new_query = CGI\->new($old_query);
.Ve
.PP
To create an empty query, initialize it from an empty string or hash:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $empty_query = CGI\->new("");
\&
\&       \-or\-
\&
\&   $empty_query = CGI\->new({});
.Ve
.SS "\s-1FETCHING A LIST OF KEYWORDS FROM THE QUERY:\s0"
.IX Subsection "FETCHING A LIST OF KEYWORDS FROM THE QUERY:"
.Vb 1
\&     @keywords = $query\->keywords
.Ve
.PP
If the script was invoked as the result of an <\s-1ISINDEX\s0> search, the
parsed keywords can be obtained as an array using the \fIkeywords()\fR method.
.SS "\s-1FETCHING THE NAMES OF ALL THE PARAMETERS PASSED TO YOUR SCRIPT:\s0"
.IX Subsection "FETCHING THE NAMES OF ALL THE PARAMETERS PASSED TO YOUR SCRIPT:"
.Vb 1
\&     @names = $query\->param
.Ve
.PP
If the script was invoked with a parameter list
(e.g. \*(L"name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3\*(R"), the \fIparam()\fR method
will return the parameter names as a list.  If the script was invoked
as an <\s-1ISINDEX\s0> script and contains a string without ampersands
(e.g. \*(L"value1+value2+value3\*(R") , there will be a single parameter named
\&\*(L"keywords\*(R" containing the \*(L"+\*(R"\-delimited keywords.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 As of version 1.5, the array of parameter names returned will
be in the same order as they were submitted by the browser.
Usually this order is the same as the order in which the 
parameters are defined in the form (however, this isn't part
of the spec, and so isn't guaranteed).
.SS "\s-1FETCHING THE VALUE OR VALUES OF A SINGLE NAMED PARAMETER:\s0"

.Vb 1
\&    @values = $query\->param(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq);
\&
\&              \-or\-
\&
\&    $value = $query\->param(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Pass the \fIparam()\fR method a single argument to fetch the value of the
named parameter. If the parameter is multivalued (e.g. from multiple
selections in a scrolling list), you can ask to receive an array.  Otherwise
the method will return a single value.
.PP
If a value is not given in the query string, as in the queries
\&\*(L"name1=&name2=\*(R", it will be returned as an empty string.
.PP
If the parameter does not exist at all, then \fIparam()\fR will return undef
in a scalar context, and the empty list in a list context.
.SS "\s-1SETTING THE VALUE\s0(S) \s-1OF A NAMED PARAMETER:\s0"

.Vb 1
\&    $query\->param(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq,\*(Aqan\*(Aq,\*(Aqarray\*(Aq,\*(Aqof\*(Aq,\*(Aqvalues\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
This sets the value for the named parameter 'foo' to an array of
values.  This is one way to change the value of a field \s-1AFTER\s0
the script has been invoked once before.  (Another way is with
the \-override parameter accepted by all methods that generate
form elements.)
.PP
\&\fIparam()\fR also recognizes a named parameter style of calling described
in more detail later:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $query\->param(\-name=>\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq,\-values=>[\*(Aqan\*(Aq,\*(Aqarray\*(Aq,\*(Aqof\*(Aq,\*(Aqvalues\*(Aq]);
\&
\&                              \-or\-

.Vb 1
\&   $query\->append(\-name=>\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq,\-values=>[\*(Aqyet\*(Aq,\*(Aqmore\*(Aq,\*(Aqvalues\*(Aq]);
.Ve
.PP
This adds a value or list of values to the named parameter.  The
values are appended to the end of the parameter if it already exists.
Otherwise the parameter is created.  Note that this method only
recognizes the named argument calling syntax.
.SS "\s-1IMPORTING ALL PARAMETERS INTO A NAMESPACE:\s0"
.IX Subsection "IMPORTING ALL PARAMETERS INTO A NAMESPACE:"
.Vb 1
\&   $query\->import_names(\*(AqR\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
This creates a series of variables in the 'R' namespace.  For example,
\&\f(CW$R::foo\fR, \f(CW@R:foo\fR.  For keyword lists, a variable \f(CW@R::keywords\fR will appear.
If no namespace is given, this method will assume 'Q'.
\&\s-1WARNING: \s0 don't import anything into 'main'; this is a major security
risk!!!!
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE 1:\s0 Variable names are transformed as necessary into legal Perl
variable names.  All non-legal characters are transformed into
underscores.  If you need to keep the original names, you should use
the \fIparam()\fR method instead to access \s-1CGI\s0 variables by name.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE 2:\s0 In older versions, this method was called \fB\f(BIimport()\fB\fR.  As of version 2.20, 
this name has been removed completely to avoid conflict with the built-in
Perl module \fBimport\fR operator.

This completely clears a list of parameters.  It sometimes useful for
resetting parameters that you don't want passed down between script
invocations.

This clears the \s-1CGI\s0 object completely.  It might be useful to ensure

If POSTed data is not of type application/x\-www\-form\-urlencoded or

instead be returned as-is in a parameter named \s-1POSTDATA. \s0 To retrieve
it, use code like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   my $data = $query\->param(\*(AqPOSTDATA\*(Aq);
.Ve

Likewise if PUTed data can be retrieved with code like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   my $data = $query\->param(\*(AqPUTDATA\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
(If you don't know what the preceding means, don't worry about it.  It
only affects people trying to use \s-1CGI\s0 for \s-1XML\s0 processing and other
specialized tasks.)

.Ve
.PP
If you need access to the parameter list in a way that isn't covered
by the methods given in the previous sections, you can obtain a direct 
reference to it by
calling the \fB\f(BIparam_fetch()\fB\fR method with the name of the parameter.  This
will return an array reference to the named parameter, which you then
can manipulate in any way you like.
.PP
You can also use a named argument style using the \fB\-name\fR argument.
.SS "\s-1FETCHING THE PARAMETER LIST AS A HASH:\s0"
.IX Subsection "FETCHING THE PARAMETER LIST AS A HASH:"
.Vb 4
\&    $params = $q\->Vars;
\&    print $params\->{\*(Aqaddress\*(Aq};
\&    @foo = split("\e0",$params\->{\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq});
\&    %params = $q\->Vars;
\&
\&    use CGI \*(Aq:cgi\-lib\*(Aq;
\&    $params = Vars;
.Ve
.PP
Many people want to fetch the entire parameter list as a hash in which
the keys are the names of the \s-1CGI\s0 parameters, and the values are the
parameters' values.  The \fIVars()\fR method does this.  Called in a scalar
context, it returns the parameter list as a tied hash reference.
Changing a key changes the value of the parameter in the underlying
\&\s-1CGI\s0 parameter list.  Called in a list context, it returns the
parameter list as an ordinary hash.  This allows you to read the
contents of the parameter list, but not to change it.
.PP
When using this, the thing you must watch out for are multivalued \s-1CGI\s0
parameters.  Because a hash cannot distinguish between scalar and
list context, multivalued parameters will be returned as a packed
string, separated by the \*(L"\e0\*(R" (null) character.  You must split this
packed string in order to get at the individual values.  This is the
convention introduced long ago by Steve Brenner in his cgi\-lib.pl
module for Perl version 4.
.PP
If you wish to use \fIVars()\fR as a function, import the \fI:cgi\-lib\fR set of
function calls (also see the section on CGI-LIB compatibility).
.SS "\s-1SAVING THE STATE OF THE SCRIPT TO A FILE:\s0"
.IX Subsection "SAVING THE STATE OF THE SCRIPT TO A FILE:"
.Vb 1
\&    $query\->save(\e*FILEHANDLE)
.Ve
.PP
This will write the current state of the form to the provided
filehandle.  You can read it back in by providing a filehandle
to the \fInew()\fR method.  Note that the filehandle can be a file, a pipe,
or whatever!
.PP
The format of the saved file is:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        NAME1=VALUE1
\&        NAME1=VALUE1\*(Aq
\&        NAME2=VALUE2
\&        NAME3=VALUE3
\&        =
.Ve
.PP
Both name and value are \s-1URL\s0 escaped.  Multi-valued \s-1CGI\s0 parameters are
represented as repeated names.  A session record is delimited by a
single = symbol.  You can write out multiple records and read them
back in with several calls to \fBnew\fR.  You can do this across several
sessions by opening the file in append mode, allowing you to create
primitive guest books, or to keep a history of users' queries.  Here's
a short example of creating multiple session records:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use CGI;
\&
\&   open (OUT,\*(Aq>>\*(Aq,\*(Aqtest.out\*(Aq) || die;
\&   $records = 5;
\&   for (0..$records) {
\&       my $q = CGI\->new;
\&       $q\->param(\-name=>\*(Aqcounter\*(Aq,\-value=>$_);
\&       $q\->save(\e*OUT);
\&   }
\&   close OUT;
\&
\&   # reopen for reading
\&   open (IN,\*(Aq<\*(Aq,\*(Aqtest.out\*(Aq) || die;
\&   while (!eof(IN)) {
\&       my $q = CGI\->new(\e*IN);
\&       print $q\->param(\*(Aqcounter\*(Aq),"\en";
\&   }
.Ve
.PP
The file format used for save/restore is identical to that used by the
Whitehead Genome Center's data exchange format \*(L"Boulderio\*(R", and can be
manipulated and even databased using Boulderio utilities.  See

.SS "\s-1RETRIEVING CGI ERRORS\s0"
.IX Subsection "RETRIEVING CGI ERRORS"
Errors can occur while processing user input, particularly when
processing uploaded files.  When these errors occur, \s-1CGI\s0 will stop
processing and return an empty parameter list.  You can test for
the existence and nature of errors using the \fI\fIcgi_error()\fI\fR function.
The error messages are formatted as \s-1HTTP\s0 status codes. You can either
incorporate the error text into an \s-1HTML\s0 page, or use it as the value
of the \s-1HTTP\s0 status:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    my $error = $q\->cgi_error;
\&    if ($error) {
\&        print $q\->header(\-status=>$error),
\&              $q\->start_html(\*(AqProblems\*(Aq),
\&              $q\->h2(\*(AqRequest not processed\*(Aq),
\&              $q\->strong($error);
\&        exit 0;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
When using the function-oriented interface (see the next section),
errors may only occur the first time you call \fI\fIparam()\fI\fR. Be ready
for this!
.SS "\s-1USING THE\s0 FUNCTION-ORIENTED \s-1INTERFACE\s0"
.IX Subsection "USING THE FUNCTION-ORIENTED INTERFACE"
To use the function-oriented interface, you must specify which \s-1CGI\s0.pm
routines or sets of routines to import into your script's namespace.
There is a small overhead associated with this importation, but it
isn't much.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use CGI <list of methods>;
.Ve
.PP
The listed methods will be imported into the current package; you can
call them directly without creating a \s-1CGI\s0 object first.  This example
shows how to import the \fB\f(BIparam()\fB\fR and \fB\f(BIheader()\fB\fR
methods, and then use them directly:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   use CGI \*(Aqparam\*(Aq,\*(Aqheader\*(Aq;
\&   print header(\*(Aqtext/plain\*(Aq);
\&   $zipcode = param(\*(Aqzipcode\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
More frequently, you'll import common sets of functions by referring
to the groups by name.  All function sets are preceded with a \*(L":\*(R"
character as in \*(L":html3\*(R" (for tags defined in the \s-1HTML 3\s0 standard).
.PP
Here is a list of the function sets you can import:
.IP "\fB:cgi\fR" 4
.IX Item ":cgi"
Import all CGI-handling methods, such as \fB\f(BIparam()\fB\fR, \fB\f(BIpath_info()\fB\fR
and the like.
.IP "\fB:form\fR" 4
.IX Item ":form"
Import all fill-out form generating methods, such as \fB\f(BItextfield()\fB\fR.
.IP "\fB:html2\fR" 4
.IX Item ":html2"
Import all methods that generate \s-1HTML 2.0\s0 standard elements.
.IP "\fB:html3\fR" 4
.IX Item ":html3"
Import all methods that generate \s-1HTML 3.0\s0 elements (such as
<table>, <super> and <sub>).
.IP "\fB:html4\fR" 4
.IX Item ":html4"
Import all methods that generate \s-1HTML 4\s0 elements (such as
<abbrev>, <acronym> and <thead>).
.IP "\fB:netscape\fR" 4
.IX Item ":netscape"
Import the <blink>, <fontsize> and <center> tags.
.IP "\fB:html\fR" 4
.IX Item ":html"
Import all HTML-generating shortcuts (i.e. 'html2', 'html3', 'html4' and 'netscape')
.IP "\fB:standard\fR" 4
.IX Item ":standard"
Import \*(L"standard\*(R" features, 'html2', 'html3', 'html4', 'form' and 'cgi'.
.IP "\fB:all\fR" 4
.IX Item ":all"
Import all the available methods.  For the full list, see the \s-1CGI\s0.pm
code, where the variable \f(CW%EXPORT_TAGS\fR is defined.
.PP
If you import a function name that is not part of \s-1CGI\s0.pm, the module
will treat it as a new \s-1HTML\s0 tag and generate the appropriate
subroutine.  You can then use it like any other \s-1HTML\s0 tag.  This is to
provide for the rapidly-evolving \s-1HTML \s0\*(L"standard.\*(R"  For example, say
Microsoft comes out with a new tag called <gradient> (which causes the
user's desktop to be flooded with a rotating gradient fill until his
machine reboots).  You don't need to wait for a new version of \s-1CGI\s0.pm
to start using it immediately:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   use CGI qw/:standard :html3 gradient/;
\&   print gradient({\-start=>\*(Aqred\*(Aq,\-end=>\*(Aqblue\*(Aq});
.Ve
.PP
Note that in the interests of execution speed \s-1CGI\s0.pm does \fBnot\fR use
the standard Exporter syntax for specifying load symbols.  This may
change in the future.
.PP
If you import any of the state-maintaining \s-1CGI\s0 or form-generating
methods, a default \s-1CGI\s0 object will be created and initialized
automatically the first time you use any of the methods that require
one to be present.  This includes \fB\f(BIparam()\fB\fR, \fB\f(BItextfield()\fB\fR,
\&\fB\f(BIsubmit()\fB\fR and the like.  (If you need direct access to the \s-1CGI\s0
object, you can find it in the global variable \fB\f(CB$CGI::Q\fB\fR).  By
importing \s-1CGI\s0.pm methods, you can create visually elegant scripts:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&   use CGI qw/:standard/;
\&   print 
\&       header,
\&       start_html(\*(AqSimple Script\*(Aq),
\&       h1(\*(AqSimple Script\*(Aq),
\&       start_form,
\&       "What\*(Aqs your name? ",textfield(\*(Aqname\*(Aq),p,
\&       "What\*(Aqs the combination?",
\&       checkbox_group(\-name=>\*(Aqwords\*(Aq,
\&                      \-values=>[\*(Aqeenie\*(Aq,\*(Aqmeenie\*(Aq,\*(Aqminie\*(Aq,\*(Aqmoe\*(Aq],
\&                      \-defaults=>[\*(Aqeenie\*(Aq,\*(Aqmoe\*(Aq]),p,
\&       "What\*(Aqs your favorite color?",
\&       popup_menu(\-name=>\*(Aqcolor\*(Aq,
\&                  \-values=>[\*(Aqred\*(Aq,\*(Aqgreen\*(Aq,\*(Aqblue\*(Aq,\*(Aqchartreuse\*(Aq]),p,
\&       submit,
\&       end_form,
\&       hr,"\en";
\&
\&    if (param) {
\&       print 
\&           "Your name is ",em(param(\*(Aqname\*(Aq)),p,
\&           "The keywords are: ",em(join(", ",param(\*(Aqwords\*(Aq))),p,
\&           "Your favorite color is ",em(param(\*(Aqcolor\*(Aq)),".\en";
\&    }
\&    print end_html;
.Ve
.SS "\s-1PRAGMAS\s0"
.IX Subsection "PRAGMAS"
In addition to the function sets, there are a number of pragmas that
you can import.  Pragmas, which are always preceded by a hyphen,
change the way that \s-1CGI\s0.pm functions in various ways.  Pragmas,
function sets, and individual functions can all be imported in the
same \fIuse()\fR line.  For example, the following use statement imports the
standard set of functions and enables debugging mode (pragma
\&\-debug):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use CGI qw/:standard \-debug/;
.Ve
.PP
The current list of pragmas is as follows:
.IP "\-any" 4
.IX Item "-any"
When you \fIuse \s-1CGI\s0 \-any\fR, then any method that the query object
doesn't recognize will be interpreted as a new \s-1HTML\s0 tag.  This allows
you to support the next \fIad hoc\fR \s-1HTML\s0
extension.  This lets you go wild with new and unsupported tags:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   use CGI qw(\-any);
\&   $q=CGI\->new;
\&   print $q\->gradient({speed=>\*(Aqfast\*(Aq,start=>\*(Aqred\*(Aq,end=>\*(Aqblue\*(Aq});
.Ve
.Sp
Since using <cite>any</cite> causes any mistyped method name
to be interpreted as an \s-1HTML\s0 tag, use it with care or not at
all.
.IP "\-compile" 4
.IX Item "-compile"
This causes the indicated autoloaded methods to be compiled up front,
rather than deferred to later.  This is useful for scripts that run
for an extended period of time under FastCGI or mod_perl, and for
those destined to be crunched by Malcolm Beattie's Perl compiler.  Use
it in conjunction with the methods or method families you plan to use.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   use CGI qw(\-compile :standard :html3);
.Ve
.Sp
or even
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   use CGI qw(\-compile :all);
.Ve
.Sp
Note that using the \-compile pragma in this way will always have
the effect of importing the compiled functions into the current
namespace.  If you want to compile without importing use the
\&\fIcompile()\fR method instead:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   use CGI();
\&   CGI\->compile();
.Ve
.Sp
This is particularly useful in a mod_perl environment, in which you
might want to precompile all \s-1CGI\s0 routines in a startup script, and
then import the functions individually in each mod_perl script.
.IP "\-nosticky" 4
.IX Item "-nosticky"
By default the \s-1CGI\s0 module implements a state-preserving behavior
called \*(L"sticky\*(R" fields.  The way this works is that if you are
regenerating a form, the methods that generate the form field values
will interrogate \fIparam()\fR to see if similarly-named parameters are
present in the query string. If they find a like-named parameter, they
will use it to set their default values.
.Sp
Sometimes this isn't what you want.  The \fB\-nosticky\fR pragma prevents
this behavior.  You can also selectively change the sticky behavior in
each element that you generate.
.IP "\-tabindex" 4
.IX Item "-tabindex"
Automatically add tab index attributes to each form field. With this
option turned off, you can still add tab indexes manually by passing a
\&\-tabindex option to each field-generating method.
.IP "\-no_undef_params" 4
.IX Item "-no_undef_params"
This keeps \s-1CGI\s0.pm from including undef params in the parameter list.
.IP "\-no_xhtml" 4
.IX Item "-no_xhtml"
By default, \s-1CGI\s0.pm versions 2.69 and higher emit \s-1XHTML
\&\s0(http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/).  The \-no_xhtml pragma disables this
feature.  Thanks to Michalis Kabrianis <kabrianis@hellug.gr> for this
feature.
.Sp
If \fIstart_html()\fR's \-dtd parameter specifies an \s-1HTML 2.0, 
3.2, 4.0\s0 or 4.01 \s-1DTD, 
XHTML\s0 will automatically be disabled without needing to use this 
pragma.
.IP "\-utf8" 4
.IX Item "-utf8"
This makes \s-1CGI\s0.pm treat all parameters as \s-1UTF\-8\s0 strings. Use this with
care, as it will interfere with the processing of binary uploads. It
is better to manually select which fields are expected to return utf\-8
strings and convert them using code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& use Encode;
\& my $arg = decode utf8=>param(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq);
.Ve
.IP "\-nph" 4
.IX Item "-nph"
This makes \s-1CGI\s0.pm produce a header appropriate for an \s-1NPH \s0(no
parsed header) script.  You may need to do other things as well
to tell the server that the script is \s-1NPH. \s0 See the discussion
of \s-1NPH\s0 scripts below.
.IP "\-newstyle_urls" 4
.IX Item "-newstyle_urls"
Separate the name=value pairs in \s-1CGI\s0 parameter query strings with
semicolons rather than ampersands.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   ?name=fred;age=24;favorite_color=3
.Ve
.Sp
Semicolon-delimited query strings are always accepted, and will be emitted by
\&\fIself_url()\fR and \fIquery_string()\fR. newstyle_urls became the default in version
2.64.
.IP "\-oldstyle_urls" 4
.IX Item "-oldstyle_urls"
Separate the name=value pairs in \s-1CGI\s0 parameter query strings with
ampersands rather than semicolons.  This is no longer the default.
.IP "\-autoload" 4
.IX Item "-autoload"
This overrides the autoloader so that any function in your program
that is not recognized is referred to \s-1CGI\s0.pm for possible evaluation.
This allows you to use all the \s-1CGI\s0.pm functions without adding them to
your symbol table, which is of concern for mod_perl users who are
worried about memory consumption.  \fIWarning:\fR when
\&\fI\-autoload\fR is in effect, you cannot use \*(L"poetry mode\*(R"
(functions without the parenthesis).  Use \fI\fIhr()\fI\fR rather
than \fIhr\fR, or add something like \fIuse subs qw/hr p header/\fR 
to the top of your script.
.IP "\-no_debug" 4
.IX Item "-no_debug"
This turns off the command-line processing features.  If you want to
run a \s-1CGI\s0.pm script from the command line to produce \s-1HTML,\s0 and you
don't want it to read \s-1CGI\s0 parameters from the command line or \s-1STDIN,\s0
then use this pragma:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   use CGI qw(\-no_debug :standard);
.Ve
.IP "\-debug" 4
.IX Item "-debug"
This turns on full debugging.  In addition to reading \s-1CGI\s0 arguments
from the command-line processing, \s-1CGI\s0.pm will pause and try to read
arguments from \s-1STDIN,\s0 producing the message \*(L"(offline mode: enter
name=value pairs on standard input)\*(R" features.
.Sp
See the section on debugging for more details.
.IP "\-private_tempfiles" 4
.IX Item "-private_tempfiles"
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm can process uploaded file. Ordinarily it spools the uploaded
file to a temporary directory, then deletes the file when done.
However, this opens the risk of eavesdropping as described in the file
upload section.  Another \s-1CGI\s0 script author could peek at this data
during the upload, even if it is confidential information. On Unix
systems, the \-private_tempfiles pragma will cause the temporary file
to be unlinked as soon as it is opened and before any data is written
into it, reducing, but not eliminating the risk of eavesdropping
(there is still a potential race condition).  To make life harder for
the attacker, the program chooses tempfile names by calculating a 32
bit checksum of the incoming \s-1HTTP\s0 headers.
.Sp
To ensure that the temporary file cannot be read by other \s-1CGI\s0 scripts,
use suEXEC or a \s-1CGI\s0 wrapper program to run your script.  The temporary
file is created with mode 0600 (neither world nor group readable).
.Sp
The temporary directory is selected using the following algorithm:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    1. if $CGITempFile::TMPDIRECTORY is already set, use that
\&
\&    2. if the environment variable TMPDIR exists, use the location
\&    indicated.
\&
\&    3. Otherwise try the locations /usr/tmp, /var/tmp, C:\etemp,
\&    /tmp, /temp, ::Temporary Items, and \eWWW_ROOT.
.Ve
.Sp
Each of these locations is checked that it is a directory and is
writable.  If not, the algorithm tries the next choice.
.SS "\s-1SPECIAL FORMS FOR IMPORTING\s0 HTML-TAG \s-1FUNCTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "SPECIAL FORMS FOR IMPORTING HTML-TAG FUNCTIONS"
Many of the methods generate \s-1HTML\s0 tags.  As described below, tag
functions automatically generate both the opening and closing tags.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  print h1(\*(AqLevel 1 Header\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
produces
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  <h1>Level 1 Header</h1>
.Ve
.PP
There will be some times when you want to produce the start and end
tags yourself.  In this case, you can use the form start_\fItag_name\fR
and end_\fItag_name\fR, as in:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  print start_h1,\*(AqLevel 1 Header\*(Aq,end_h1;
.Ve
.PP
With a few exceptions (described below), start_\fItag_name\fR and
end_\fItag_name\fR functions are not generated automatically when you
\&\fIuse \s-1CGI\s0\fR.  However, you can specify the tags you want to generate
\&\fIstart/end\fR functions for by putting an asterisk in front of their
name, or, alternatively, requesting either "start_\fItag_name\fR\*(L" or
\&\*(R"end_\fItag_name\fR" in the import list.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use CGI qw/:standard *table start_ul/;
.Ve
.PP
In this example, the following functions are generated in addition to
the standard ones:
.IP "1. \fIstart_table()\fR (generates a <table> tag)" 4
.IX Item "1. start_table() (generates a <table> tag)"
.PD 0
.IP "2. \fIend_table()\fR (generates a </table> tag)" 4
.IX Item "2. end_table() (generates a </table> tag)"
.IP "3. \fIstart_ul()\fR (generates a <ul> tag)" 4
.IX Item "3. start_ul() (generates a <ul> tag)"
.IP "4. \fIend_ul()\fR (generates a </ul> tag)" 4
.IX Item "4. end_ul() (generates a </ul> tag)"
.PD
.SH "GENERATING DYNAMIC DOCUMENTS"
.IX Header "GENERATING DYNAMIC DOCUMENTS"
Most of \s-1CGI\s0.pm's functions deal with creating documents on the fly.
Generally you will produce the \s-1HTTP\s0 header first, followed by the
document itself.  \s-1CGI\s0.pm provides functions for generating \s-1HTTP\s0
headers of various types as well as for generating \s-1HTML. \s0 For creating
\&\s-1GIF\s0 images, see the \s-1GD\s0.pm module.
.PP
Each of these functions produces a fragment of \s-1HTML\s0 or \s-1HTTP\s0 which you
can print out directly so that it displays in the browser window,
append to a string, or save to a file for later use.
.SS "\s-1CREATING A STANDARD HTTP HEADER:\s0"
.IX Subsection "CREATING A STANDARD HTTP HEADER:"
Normally the first thing you will do in any \s-1CGI\s0 script is print out an
\&\s-1HTTP\s0 header.  This tells the browser what type of document to expect,
and gives other optional information, such as the language, expiration
date, and whether to cache the document.  The header can also be
manipulated for special purposes, such as server push and pay per view
pages.

\&\fIheader()\fR returns the Content-type: header.  You can provide your own
\&\s-1MIME\s0 type if you choose, otherwise it defaults to text/html.  An
optional second parameter specifies the status code and a human-readable
message.  For example, you can specify 204, \*(L"No response\*(R" to create a
script that tells the browser to do nothing at all. Note that \s-1RFC 2616\s0 expects
the human-readable phase to be there as well as the numeric status code.
.PP
The last example shows the named argument style for passing arguments
to the \s-1CGI\s0 methods using named parameters.  Recognized parameters are
\&\fB\-type\fR, \fB\-status\fR, \fB\-expires\fR, and \fB\-cookie\fR.  Any other named
parameters will be stripped of their initial hyphens and turned into
header fields, allowing you to specify any \s-1HTTP\s0 header you desire.
Internal underscores will be turned into hyphens:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print header(\-Content_length=>3002);
.Ve
.PP
Most browsers will not cache the output from \s-1CGI\s0 scripts.  Every time
the browser reloads the page, the script is invoked anew.  You can
change this behavior with the \fB\-expires\fR parameter.  When you specify
an absolute or relative expiration interval with this parameter, some
browsers and proxy servers will cache the script's output until the
indicated expiration date.  The following forms are all valid for the
\&\-expires field:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        +30s                              30 seconds from now
\&        +10m                              ten minutes from now

\&        \-1d                               yesterday (i.e. "ASAP!")
\&        now                               immediately
\&        +3M                               in three months

\&        Thursday, 25\-Apr\-1999 00:40:33 GMT  at the indicated time & date
.Ve
.PP
The \fB\-cookie\fR parameter generates a header that tells the browser to provide
a \*(L"magic cookie\*(R" during all subsequent transactions with your script.
Some cookies have a special format that includes interesting attributes
such as expiration time.  Use the \fIcookie()\fR method to create and retrieve
session cookies.
.PP
The \fB\-nph\fR parameter, if set to a true value, will issue the correct
headers to work with a \s-1NPH \s0(no-parse-header) script.  This is important
to use with certain servers that expect all their scripts to be \s-1NPH.\s0
.PP
The \fB\-charset\fR parameter can be used to control the character set
sent to the browser.  If not provided, defaults to \s-1ISO\-8859\-1. \s0 As a
side effect, this sets the \fIcharset()\fR method as well.
.PP
The \fB\-attachment\fR parameter can be used to turn the page into an
attachment.  Instead of displaying the page, some browsers will prompt
the user to save it to disk.  The value of the argument is the
suggested name for the saved file.  In order for this to work, you may
have to set the \fB\-type\fR to \*(L"application/octet\-stream\*(R".
.PP
The \fB\-p3p\fR parameter will add a P3P tag to the outgoing header.  The
parameter can be an arrayref or a space-delimited string of P3P tags.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   print header(\-p3p=>[qw(CAO DSP LAW CURa)]);
\&   print header(\-p3p=>\*(AqCAO DSP LAW CURa\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
In either case, the outgoing header will be formatted as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  P3P: policyref="/w3c/p3p.xml" cp="CAO DSP LAW CURa"
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm will accept valid multi-line headers when each line is separated with a
\&\s-1CRLF\s0 value (\*(L"\er\en\*(R" on most platforms) followed by at least one space. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print header( \-ingredients => "ham\er\en\eseggs\er\en\esbacon" );
.Ve
.PP
Invalid multi-line header input will trigger in an exception. When multi-line headers
are received, \s-1CGI\s0.pm will always output them back as a single line, according to the
folding rules of \s-1RFC 2616:\s0 the newlines will be removed, while the white space remains.
.SS "\s-1GENERATING A REDIRECTION HEADER\s0"
.IX Subsection "GENERATING A REDIRECTION HEADER"
.Vb 1
\&   print $q\->redirect(\*(Aqhttp://somewhere.else/in/movie/land\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Sometimes you don't want to produce a document yourself, but simply
redirect the browser elsewhere, perhaps choosing a \s-1URL\s0 based on the
time of day or the identity of the user.
.PP
The \fIredirect()\fR method redirects the browser to a different \s-1URL. \s0 If
you use redirection like this, you should \fBnot\fR print out a header as
well.
.PP
You should always use full URLs (including the http: or ftp: part) in
redirection requests.  Relative URLs will not work correctly.
.PP
You can also use named arguments:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    print $q\->redirect(
\&        \-uri=>\*(Aqhttp://somewhere.else/in/movie/land\*(Aq,
\&            \-nph=>1,
\&         \-status=>\*(Aq301 Moved Permanently\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
All names arguments recognized by \fIheader()\fR are also recognized by
\&\fIredirect()\fR. However, most \s-1HTTP\s0 headers, including those generated by
\&\-cookie and \-target, are ignored by the browser.
.PP
The \fB\-nph\fR parameter, if set to a true value, will issue the correct
headers to work with a \s-1NPH \s0(no-parse-header) script.  This is important
to use with certain servers, such as Microsoft \s-1IIS,\s0 which
expect all their scripts to be \s-1NPH.\s0
.PP
The \fB\-status\fR parameter will set the status of the redirect.  \s-1HTTP\s0
defines three different possible redirection status codes:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&     301 Moved Permanently
\&     302 Found
\&     303 See Other
.Ve
.PP
The default if not specified is 302, which means \*(L"moved temporarily.\*(R"
You may change the status to another status code if you wish.  Be
advised that changing the status to anything other than 301, 302 or
303 will probably break redirection.
.PP
Note that the human-readable phrase is also expected to be present to conform
with \s-1RFC 2616,\s0 section 6.1.

.PP
The \fIstart_html()\fR routine creates the top of the
page, along with a lot of optional information that controls the
page's appearance and behavior.
.PP
This method returns a canned \s-1HTML\s0 header and the opening <body> tag.
All parameters are optional.  In the named parameter form, recognized
parameters are \-title, \-author, \-base, \-xbase, \-dtd, \-lang and \-target
(see below for the explanation).  Any additional parameters you
provide, such as the unofficial \s-1BGCOLOR\s0 attribute, are added
to the <body> tag.  Additional parameters must be proceeded by a
hyphen.
.PP
The argument \fB\-xbase\fR allows you to provide an \s-1HREF\s0 for the <base> tag
different from the current location, as in
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \-xbase=>"http://home.mcom.com/"
.Ve
.PP
All relative links will be interpreted relative to this tag.
.PP
The argument \fB\-target\fR allows you to provide a default target frame
for all the links and fill-out forms on the page.  \fBThis is a
non-standard \s-1HTTP\s0 feature which only works with some browsers!\fR
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \-target=>"answer_window"
.Ve
.PP
All relative links will be interpreted relative to this tag.
You add arbitrary meta information to the header with the \fB\-meta\fR
argument.  This argument expects a reference to a hash
containing name/value pairs of meta information.  These will be turned
into a series of header <meta> tags that look something like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    <meta name="keywords" content="pharaoh secret mummy">
\&    <meta name="description" content="copyright 1996 King Tut">
.Ve
.PP
To create an HTTP-EQUIV type of <meta> tag, use \fB\-head\fR, described
below.
.PP
The \fB\-style\fR argument is used to incorporate cascading stylesheets
into your code.  See the section on \s-1CASCADING STYLESHEETS\s0 for more
information.
.PP
The \fB\-lang\fR argument is used to incorporate a language attribute into
the <html> tag.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print $q\->start_html(\-lang=>\*(Aqfr\-CA\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
The default if not specified is \*(L"en-US\*(R" for \s-1US\s0 English, unless the 
\&\-dtd parameter specifies an \s-1HTML 2.0\s0 or 3.2 \s-1DTD,\s0 in which case the
lang attribute is left off.  You can force the lang attribute to left
off in other cases by passing an empty string (\-lang=>'').
.PP
The \fB\-encoding\fR argument can be used to specify the character set for
\&\s-1XHTML. \s0 It defaults to iso\-8859\-1 if not specified.
.PP
The \fB\-dtd\fR argument can be used to specify a public \s-1DTD\s0 identifier string. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \-dtd => \*(Aq\-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\*(Aq)
.Ve
.PP
Alternatively, it can take public and system \s-1DTD\s0 identifiers as an array:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    dtd => [ \*(Aq\-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\*(Aq, \*(Aqhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\*(Aq ]
.Ve
.PP
For the public \s-1DTD\s0 identifier to be considered, it must be valid. Otherwise it
will be replaced by the default \s-1DTD.\s0 If the public \s-1DTD\s0 contains '\s-1XHTML\s0', \s-1CGI\s0.pm
will emit \s-1XML.\s0
.PP
The \fB\-declare_xml\fR argument, when used in conjunction with \s-1XHTML,\s0
will put a <?xml> declaration at the top of the \s-1HTML\s0 header. The sole
purpose of this declaration is to declare the character set
encoding. In the absence of \-declare_xml, the output \s-1HTML\s0 will contain
a <meta> tag that specifies the encoding, allowing the \s-1HTML\s0 to pass
most validators.  The default for \-declare_xml is false.
.PP
You can place other arbitrary \s-1HTML\s0 elements to the <head> section with the
\&\fB\-head\fR tag.  For example, to place a <link> element in the
head section, use this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    print start_html(\-head=>Link({\-rel=>\*(Aqshortcut icon\*(Aq,
\&                                  \-href=>\*(Aqfavicon.ico\*(Aq}));
.Ve
.PP
To incorporate multiple \s-1HTML\s0 elements into the <head> section, just pass an
array reference:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    print start_html(\-head=>[ 
\&                             Link({\-rel=>\*(Aqnext\*(Aq,
\&                                   \-href=>\*(Aqhttp://www.capricorn.com/s2.html\*(Aq}),
\&                             Link({\-rel=>\*(Aqprevious\*(Aq,
\&                                   \-href=>\*(Aqhttp://www.capricorn.com/s1.html\*(Aq})
\&                             ]
\&                     );
.Ve
.PP
And here's how to create an HTTP-EQUIV <meta> tag:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&      print start_html(\-head=>meta({\-http_equiv => \*(AqContent\-Type\*(Aq,
\&                                    \-content    => \*(Aqtext/html\*(Aq}))
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1JAVASCRIPTING:\s0 The \fB\-script\fR, \fB\-noScript\fR, \fB\-onLoad\fR,
\&\fB\-onMouseOver\fR, \fB\-onMouseOut\fR and \fB\-onUnload\fR parameters are used
to add JavaScript calls to your pages.  \fB\-script\fR should
point to a block of text containing JavaScript function definitions.
This block will be placed within a <script> block inside the \s-1HTML \s0(not
\&\s-1HTTP\s0) header.  The block is placed in the header in order to give your
page a fighting chance of having all its JavaScript functions in place
even if the user presses the stop button before the page has loaded
completely.  \s-1CGI\s0.pm attempts to format the script in such a way that
JavaScript-naive browsers will not choke on the code: unfortunately
there are some browsers, such as Chimera for Unix, that get confused
by it nevertheless.
.PP
The \fB\-onLoad\fR and \fB\-onUnload\fR parameters point to fragments of JavaScript
code to execute when the page is respectively opened and closed by the
browser.  Usually these parameters are calls to functions defined in the
\&\fB\-script\fR field:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&      $query = CGI\->new;
\&      print header;
\&      $JSCRIPT=<<END;
\&      // Ask a silly question
\&      function riddle_me_this() {
\&         var r = prompt("What walks on four legs in the morning, " +
\&                       "two legs in the afternoon, " +
\&                       "and three legs in the evening?");
\&         response(r);
\&      }
\&      // Get a silly answer
\&      function response(answer) {
\&         if (answer == "man")
\&            alert("Right you are!");
\&         else
\&            alert("Wrong!  Guess again.");
\&      }
\&      END
\&      print start_html(\-title=>\*(AqThe Riddle of the Sphinx\*(Aq,
\&                               \-script=>$JSCRIPT);
.Ve
.PP
Use the \fB\-noScript\fR parameter to pass some \s-1HTML\s0 text that will be displayed on 
browsers that do not have JavaScript (or browsers where JavaScript is turned
off).
.PP
The <script> tag, has several attributes including \*(L"type\*(R", \*(L"charset\*(R" and \*(L"src\*(R".
\&\*(L"src\*(R" allows you to keep JavaScript code in an external file. To use these
attributes pass a \s-1HASH\s0 reference in the \fB\-script\fR parameter containing one or
more of \-type, \-src, or \-code:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    print $q\->start_html(\-title=>\*(AqThe Riddle of the Sphinx\*(Aq,
\&                         \-script=>{\-type=>\*(AqJAVASCRIPT\*(Aq,

\&               );
.Ve
.PP
A final feature allows you to incorporate multiple <script> sections into the
header.  Just pass the list of script sections as an array reference.
this allows you to specify different source files for different dialects
of JavaScript.  Example:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&     print $q\->start_html(\-title=>\*(AqThe Riddle of the Sphinx\*(Aq,
\&                          \-script=>[

It is possible for a script to receive \s-1CGI\s0 parameters in the \s-1URL\s0 as
well as in the fill-out form by creating a form that POSTs to a \s-1URL\s0
containing a query string (a \*(L"?\*(R" mark followed by arguments).  The
\&\fB\f(BIparam()\fB\fR method will always return the contents of the POSTed
fill-out form, ignoring the \s-1URL\s0's query string.  To retrieve \s-1URL\s0
parameters, call the \fB\f(BIurl_param()\fB\fR method.  Use it in the same way as
\&\fB\f(BIparam()\fB\fR.  The main difference is that it allows you to read the
parameters, but not set them.
.PP
Under no circumstances will the contents of the \s-1URL\s0 query string
interfere with similarly-named \s-1CGI\s0 parameters in POSTed forms.  If you
try to mix a \s-1URL\s0 query string with a form submitted with the \s-1GET\s0
method, the results will not be what you expect.
.SH "CREATING STANDARD HTML ELEMENTS:"
.IX Header "CREATING STANDARD HTML ELEMENTS:"
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm defines general \s-1HTML\s0 shortcut methods for many \s-1HTML\s0 tags.  \s-1HTML\s0 shortcuts are named after a single
\&\s-1HTML\s0 element and return a fragment of \s-1HTML\s0 text. Example:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&   print $q\->blockquote(
\&                     "Many years ago on the island of",
\&                     $q\->a({href=>"http://crete.org/"},"Crete"),
\&                     "there lived a Minotaur named",
\&                     $q\->strong("Fred."),
\&                    ),
\&       $q\->hr;
.Ve
.PP
This results in the following \s-1HTML\s0 code (extra newlines have been
added for readability):
.PP
.Vb 6
\&   <blockquote>
\&   Many years ago on the island of
\&   <a href="http://crete.org/">Crete</a> there lived
\&   a minotaur named <strong>Fred.</strong> 
\&   </blockquote>
\&   <hr>
.Ve
.PP
If you find the syntax for calling the \s-1HTML\s0 shortcuts awkward, you can
import them into your namespace and dispense with the object syntax
completely (see the next section for more details):
.PP
.Vb 8
\&   use CGI \*(Aq:standard\*(Aq;
\&   print blockquote(
\&      "Many years ago on the island of",
\&      a({href=>"http://crete.org/"},"Crete"),
\&      "there lived a minotaur named",
\&      strong("Fred."),
\&      ),
\&      hr;
.Ve
.SS "\s-1PROVIDING ARGUMENTS TO HTML SHORTCUTS\s0"
.IX Subsection "PROVIDING ARGUMENTS TO HTML SHORTCUTS"
The \s-1HTML\s0 methods will accept zero, one or multiple arguments.  If you
provide no arguments, you get a single tag:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   print hr;    #  <hr>
.Ve
.PP
If you provide one or more string arguments, they are concatenated
together with spaces and placed between opening and closing tags:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   print h1("Chapter","1"); # <h1>Chapter 1</h1>"
.Ve
.PP
If the first argument is a hash reference, then the keys
and values of the hash become the \s-1HTML\s0 tag's attributes:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   print a({\-href=>\*(Aqfred.html\*(Aq,\-target=>\*(Aq_new\*(Aq},
\&      "Open a new frame");
\&
\&            <a href="fred.html",target="_new">Open a new frame</a>
.Ve
.PP
You may dispense with the dashes in front of the attribute names if
you prefer:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   print img {src=>\*(Aqfred.gif\*(Aq,align=>\*(AqLEFT\*(Aq};
\&
\&           <img align="LEFT" src="fred.gif">
.Ve
.PP
Sometimes an \s-1HTML\s0 tag attribute has no argument.  For example, ordered
lists can be marked as \s-1COMPACT. \s0 The syntax for this is an argument that
that points to an undef string:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   print ol({compact=>undef},li(\*(Aqone\*(Aq),li(\*(Aqtwo\*(Aq),li(\*(Aqthree\*(Aq));
.Ve
.PP
Prior to \s-1CGI\s0.pm version 2.41, providing an empty ('') string as an
attribute argument was the same as providing undef.  However, this has
changed in order to accommodate those who want to create tags of the form 
<img alt="">.  The difference is shown in these two pieces of code:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   CODE                   RESULT
\&   img({alt=>undef})      <img alt>
\&   img({alt=>\*(Aq\*(Aq})         <img alt="">
.Ve
.SS "\s-1THE DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY OF HTML SHORTCUTS\s0"
.IX Subsection "THE DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY OF HTML SHORTCUTS"
One of the cool features of the \s-1HTML\s0 shortcuts is that they are
distributive.  If you give them an argument consisting of a
\&\fBreference\fR to a list, the tag will be distributed across each
element of the list.  For example, here's one way to make an ordered
list:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   print ul(
\&             li({\-type=>\*(Aqdisc\*(Aq},[\*(AqSneezy\*(Aq,\*(AqDoc\*(Aq,\*(AqSleepy\*(Aq,\*(AqHappy\*(Aq])
\&           );
.Ve
.PP
This example will result in \s-1HTML\s0 output that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&   <ul>
\&     <li type="disc">Sneezy</li>
\&     <li type="disc">Doc</li>
\&     <li type="disc">Sleepy</li>
\&     <li type="disc">Happy</li>
\&   </ul>
.Ve
.PP
This is extremely useful for creating tables.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&   print table({\-border=>undef},
\&           caption(\*(AqWhen Should You Eat Your Vegetables?\*(Aq),
\&           Tr({\-align=>\*(AqCENTER\*(Aq,\-valign=>\*(AqTOP\*(Aq},

Consider this bit of code:

.Ve

It will ordinarily return the string that you probably expect, namely:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   <blockquote><em>Hi</em> mom!</blockquote>
.Ve
.PP
Note the space between the element \*(L"Hi\*(R" and the element \*(L"mom!\*(R".
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm puts the extra space there using array interpolation, which is
controlled by the magic $\*(L" variable.  Sometimes this extra space is
not what you want, for example, when you are trying to align a series
of images.  In this case, you can simply change the value of $\*(R" to an
empty string.
.PP
.Vb 4

.SS "\s-1AUTOESCAPING HTML\s0"
.IX Subsection "AUTOESCAPING HTML"
By default, all \s-1HTML\s0 that is emitted by the form-generating functions
is passed through a function called \fIescapeHTML()\fR:
.ie n .IP "$escaped_string = escapeHTML(""unescaped string"");" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$escaped_string\fR = escapeHTML(``unescaped string'');" 4
.IX Item "$escaped_string = escapeHTML(unescaped string);"
Escape \s-1HTML\s0 formatting characters in a string.
.PP
Provided that you have specified a character set of \s-1ISO\-8859\-1 \s0(the
default), the standard \s-1HTML\s0 escaping rules will be used.  The \*(L"<\*(R"
character becomes \*(L"&lt;\*(R", \*(L">\*(R" becomes \*(L"&gt;\*(R", \*(L"&\*(R" becomes \*(L"&amp;\*(R", and
the quote character becomes \*(L"&quot;\*(R".  In addition, the hexadecimal
0x8b and 0x9b characters, which some browsers incorrectly interpret
as the left and right angle-bracket characters, are replaced by their
numeric character entities (\*(L"&#8249\*(R" and \*(L"&#8250;\*(R").  If you manually change
the charset, either by calling the \fIcharset()\fR method explicitly or by
passing a \-charset argument to \fIheader()\fR, then \fBall\fR characters will
be replaced by their numeric entities, since \s-1CGI\s0.pm has no lookup
table for all the possible encodings.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`escapeHTML()\*(C'\fR expects the supplied string to be a character string. This means you
should Encode::decode data received from \*(L"outside\*(R" and Encode::encode your
strings before sending them back outside. If your source code \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded and
you want to upgrade string literals in your source to character strings, you
can use \*(L"use utf8\*(R". See perlunitut, perlunifaq and perlunicode for more
information on how Perl handles the difference between bytes and characters.
.PP
The automatic escaping does not apply to other shortcuts, such as
\&\fIh1()\fR.  You should call \fIescapeHTML()\fR yourself on untrusted data in
order to protect your pages against nasty tricks that people may enter
into guestbooks, etc..  To change the character set, use \fIcharset()\fR.
To turn autoescaping off completely, use \fIautoEscape\fR\|(0):
.ie n .IP "$charset = charset([$charset]);" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$charset\fR = charset([$charset]);" 4
.IX Item "$charset = charset([$charset]);"
Get or set the current character set.
.ie n .IP "$flag = autoEscape([$flag]);" 4

\&\fIGeneral note\fR  The various form-creating methods all return strings
to the caller, containing the tag or tags that will create the requested
form element.  You are responsible for actually printing out these strings.
It's set up this way so that you can place formatting tags
around the form elements.
.PP
\&\fIAnother note\fR The default values that you specify for the forms are only
used the \fBfirst\fR time the script is invoked (when there is no query
string).  On subsequent invocations of the script (when there is a query
string), the former values are used even if they are blank.
.PP
If you want to change the value of a field from its previous value, you have two
choices:
.PP
(1) call the \fIparam()\fR method to set it.
.PP
(2) use the \-override (alias \-force) parameter (a new feature in version 2.15).
This forces the default value to be used, regardless of the previous value:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   print textfield(\-name=>\*(Aqfield_name\*(Aq,
\&                           \-default=>\*(Aqstarting value\*(Aq,

.Ve
.PP
\&\fIYet another note\fR By default, the text and labels of form elements are
escaped according to \s-1HTML\s0 rules.  This means that you can safely use
\&\*(L"<\s-1CLICK ME\s0>\*(R" as the label for a button.  However, it also interferes with
your ability to incorporate special \s-1HTML\s0 character sequences, such as &Aacute;,
into your fields.  If you wish to turn off automatic escaping, call the
\&\fIautoEscape()\fR method with a false value immediately after creating the \s-1CGI\s0 object:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   $query = CGI\->new;
\&   $query\->autoEscape(0);
.Ve
.PP
Note that \fIautoEscape()\fR is exclusively used to effect the behavior of how some

for consistency and completeness.  If you find something wrong, you
can put up an alert box or maybe fix things up yourself.  You can 
abort the submission by returning false from this function.

.SS "\s-1FORM ELEMENTS\s0"
.IX Subsection "FORM ELEMENTS"
After starting a form, you will typically create one or more
textfields, popup menus, radio groups and other form elements.  Each
of these elements takes a standard set of named arguments.  Some
elements also have optional arguments.  The standard arguments are as
follows:
.IP "\fB\-name\fR" 4

The name of the field. After submission this name can be used to
retrieve the field's value using the \fIparam()\fR method.
.IP "\fB\-value\fR, \fB\-values\fR" 4
.IX Item "-value, -values"
The initial value of the field which will be returned to the script
after form submission.  Some form elements, such as text fields, take
a single scalar \-value argument. Others, such as popup menus, take a
reference to an array of values. The two arguments are synonyms.
.IP "\fB\-tabindex\fR" 4
.IX Item "-tabindex"
A numeric value that sets the order in which the form element receives
focus when the user presses the tab key. Elements with lower values
receive focus first.
.IP "\fB\-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-id"
A string identifier that can be used to identify this element to
JavaScript and \s-1DHTML.\s0
.IP "\fB\-override\fR" 4
.IX Item "-override"
A boolean, which, if true, forces the element to take on the value
specified by \fB\-value\fR, overriding the sticky behavior described
earlier for the \fB\-nosticky\fR pragma.

When the form is processed, you can retrieve an IO::Handle compatible

.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $lightweight_fh  = $q\->upload(\*(Aqfield_name\*(Aq);
\&
\&  # undef may be returned if it\*(Aqs not a valid file handle
\&  if (defined $lightweight_fh) {
\&    # Upgrade the handle to one compatible with IO::Handle:

\&    while ($bytesread = $io_handle\->read($buffer,1024)) {
\&      print OUTFILE $buffer;
\&    }
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
In a list context, \fIupload()\fR will return an array of filehandles.
This makes it possible to process forms that use the same name for
multiple upload fields.
.PP
If you want the entered file name for the file, you can just call \fIparam()\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $filename = $q\->param(\*(Aqfield_name\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Different browsers will return slightly different things for the
name.  Some browsers return the filename only.  Others return the full
path to the file, using the path conventions of the user's machine.
Regardless, the name returned is always the name of the file on the
\&\fIuser's\fR machine, and is unrelated to the name of the temporary file
that \s-1CGI\s0.pm creates during upload spooling (see below).
.PP
When a file is uploaded the browser usually sends along some
information along with it in the format of headers.  The information
usually includes the \s-1MIME\s0 content type. To
retrieve this information, call \fIuploadInfo()\fR.  It returns a reference to
a hash containing all the document headers.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&       $filename = $q\->param(\*(Aquploaded_file\*(Aq);
\&       $type = $q\->uploadInfo($filename)\->{\*(AqContent\-Type\*(Aq};
\&       unless ($type eq \*(Aqtext/html\*(Aq) {
\&        die "HTML FILES ONLY!";
\&       }
.Ve
.PP
If you are using a machine that recognizes \*(L"text\*(R" and \*(L"binary\*(R" data
modes, be sure to understand when and how to use them (see the Camel book).  
Otherwise you may find that binary files are corrupted during file
uploads.
.PP
\fIAccessing the temp files directly\fR
.IX Subsection "Accessing the temp files directly"
.PP
When processing an uploaded file, \s-1CGI\s0.pm creates a temporary file on your hard
disk and passes you a file handle to that file. After you are finished with the
file handle, \s-1CGI\s0.pm unlinks (deletes) the temporary file. If you need to you
can access the temporary file directly. You can access the temp file for a file
upload by passing the file name to the \fItmpFileName()\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&       $filename = $query\->param(\*(Aquploaded_file\*(Aq);
\&       $tmpfilename = $query\->tmpFileName($filename);
.Ve
.PP
The temporary file will be deleted automatically when your program exits unless
you manually rename it. On some operating systems (such as Windows \s-1NT\s0), you
will need to close the temporary file's filehandle before your program exits.
Otherwise the attempt to delete the temporary file will fail.
.PP
\fIHandling interrupted file uploads\fR
.IX Subsection "Handling interrupted file uploads"
.PP
There are occasionally problems involving parsing the uploaded file.
This usually happens when the user presses \*(L"Stop\*(R" before the upload is
finished.  In this case, \s-1CGI\s0.pm will return undef for the name of the
uploaded file and set \fI\fIcgi_error()\fI\fR to the string \*(L"400 Bad request
(malformed multipart \s-1POST\s0)\*(R".  This error message is designed so that
you can incorporate it into a status code to be sent to the browser.
Example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   $file = $q\->upload(\*(Aquploaded_file\*(Aq);
\&   if (!$file && $q\->cgi_error) {
\&      print $q\->header(\-status=>$q\->cgi_error);
\&      exit 0;
\&   }
.Ve
.PP
You are free to create a custom \s-1HTML\s0 page to complain about the error,
if you wish.
.PP
\fIProgress bars for file uploads and avoiding temp files\fR
.IX Subsection "Progress bars for file uploads and avoiding temp files"
.PP
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm gives you low-level access to file upload management through
a file upload hook. You can use this feature to completely turn off
the temp file storage of file uploads, or potentially write your own
file upload progress meter.
.PP
This is much like the \s-1UPLOAD_HOOK\s0 facility available in Apache::Request, with
the exception that the first argument to the callback is an Apache::Upload
object, here it's the remote filename.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $q = CGI\->new(\e&hook [,$data [,$use_tempfile]]);
\&
\& sub hook {
\&        my ($filename, $buffer, $bytes_read, $data) = @_;
\&        print  "Read $bytes_read bytes of $filename\en";
\& }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW$data\fR field is optional; it lets you pass configuration
information (e.g. a database handle) to your hook callback.
.PP
The \f(CW$use_tempfile\fR field is a flag that lets you turn on and off
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm's use of a temporary disk-based file during file upload. If you
set this to a \s-1FALSE\s0 value (default true) then \f(CW$q\fR\->param('uploaded_file')
will no longer work, and the only way to get at the uploaded data is
via the hook you provide.
.PP
If using the function-oriented interface, call the \fICGI::upload_hook()\fR
method before calling \fIparam()\fR or any other \s-1CGI\s0 functions:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  CGI::upload_hook(\e&hook [,$data [,$use_tempfile]]);
.Ve
.PP
This method is not exported by default.  You will have to import it
explicitly if you wish to use it without the \s-1CGI::\s0 prefix.
.PP
\fITroubleshooting file uploads on Windows\fR
.IX Subsection "Troubleshooting file uploads on Windows"
.PP
If you are using \s-1CGI\s0.pm on a Windows platform and find that binary
files get slightly larger when uploaded but that text files remain the
same, then you have forgotten to activate binary mode on the output
filehandle.  Be sure to call \fIbinmode()\fR on any handle that you create
to write the uploaded file to disk.
.PP
\fIOlder ways to process file uploads\fR
.IX Subsection "Older ways to process file uploads"
.PP
( This section is here for completeness. if you are building a new application with \s-1CGI\s0.pm, you can skip it. )
.PP
The original way to process file uploads with \s-1CGI\s0.pm was to use \fIparam()\fR. The
value it returns has a dual nature as both a file name and a lightweight
filehandle. This dual nature is problematic if you following the recommended
practice of having \f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR in your code. Perl will complain when you try
to use a string as a filehandle.  More seriously, it is possible for the remote
user to type garbage into the upload field, in which case what you get from
\&\fIparam()\fR is not a filehandle at all, but a string.
.PP
To solve this problem the \fIupload()\fR method was added, which always returns a
lightweight filehandle. This generally works well, but will have trouble
interoperating with some other modules because the file handle is not derived
from IO::Handle. So that brings us to current recommendation given above,
which is to call the \fIhandle()\fR method on the file handle returned by \fIupload()\fR.
That upgrades the handle to an IO::Handle. It's a big win for compatibility for
a small penalty of loading IO::Handle the first time you call it.

All modern browsers can take advantage of the optional parameters
\&\fB\-rows\fR, and \fB\-columns\fR.  These parameters cause \fIradio_group()\fR to

To include row and column headings in the returned table, you
can use the \fB\-rowheaders\fR and \fB\-colheaders\fR parameters.  Both
of these accept a pointer to an array of headings to use.
The headings are just decorative.  They don't reorganize the
interpretation of the radio buttons \*(-- they're still a single named
unit.

The optional \fB\-tabindex\fR argument can be used to control the order in which
radio buttons receive focus when the user presses the tab button.  If
passed a scalar numeric value, the first element in the group will
receive this tab index and subsequent elements will be incremented by
one.  If given a reference to an array of radio button values, then
the indexes will be jiggered so that the order specified in the array
will correspond to the tab order.  You can also pass a reference to a
hash in which the hash keys are the radio button values and the values
are the tab indexes of each button.  Examples:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  \-tabindex => 100    #  this group starts at index 100 and counts up

.SH "HTTP COOKIES"
.IX Header "HTTP COOKIES"
Browsers support a so-called \*(L"cookie\*(R" designed to help maintain state
within a browser session.  \s-1CGI\s0.pm has several methods that support
cookies.
.PP
A cookie is a name=value pair much like the named parameters in a \s-1CGI\s0
query string.  \s-1CGI\s0 scripts create one or more cookies and send
them to the browser in the \s-1HTTP\s0 header.  The browser maintains a list
of cookies that belong to a particular Web server, and returns them
to the \s-1CGI\s0 script during subsequent interactions.
.PP
In addition to the required name=value pair, each cookie has several
optional attributes:
.IP "1. an expiration time" 4
.IX Item "1. an expiration time"
This is a time/date string (in a special \s-1GMT\s0 format) that indicates
when a cookie expires.  The cookie will be saved and returned to your
script until this expiration date is reached if the user exits
the browser and restarts it.  If an expiration date isn't specified, the cookie
will remain active until the user quits the browser.
.IP "2. a domain" 4
.IX Item "2. a domain"
This is a partial or complete domain name for which the cookie is 
valid.  The browser will return the cookie to any host that matches
the partial domain name.  For example, if you specify a domain name
of \*(L".capricorn.com\*(R", then the browser will return the cookie to
Web servers running on any of the machines \*(L"www.capricorn.com\*(R", 
\&\*(L"www2.capricorn.com\*(R", \*(L"feckless.capricorn.com\*(R", etc.  Domain names
must contain at least two periods to prevent attempts to match
on top level domains like \*(L".edu\*(R".  If no domain is specified, then
the browser will only return the cookie to servers on the host the
cookie originated from.
.IP "3. a path" 4
.IX Item "3. a path"
If you provide a cookie path attribute, the browser will check it
against your script's \s-1URL\s0 before returning the cookie.  For example,
if you specify the path \*(L"/cgi\-bin\*(R", then the cookie will be returned
to each of the scripts \*(L"/cgi\-bin/tally.pl\*(R", \*(L"/cgi\-bin/order.pl\*(R",
and \*(L"/cgi\-bin/customer_service/complain.pl\*(R", but not to the script
\&\*(L"/cgi\-private/site_admin.pl\*(R".  By default, path is set to \*(L"/\*(R", which
causes the cookie to be sent to any \s-1CGI\s0 script on your site.
.ie n .IP "4. a ""secure"" flag" 4
.el .IP "4. a ``secure'' flag" 4
.IX Item "4. a secure flag"
If the \*(L"secure\*(R" attribute is set, the cookie will only be sent to your
script if the \s-1CGI\s0 request is occurring on a secure channel, such as \s-1SSL.\s0
.PP
The interface to \s-1HTTP\s0 cookies is the \fB\f(BIcookie()\fB\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    $cookie = cookie(\-name=>\*(AqsessionID\*(Aq,
\&                             \-value=>\*(Aqxyzzy\*(Aq,

\&                             \-path=>\*(Aq/cgi\-bin/database\*(Aq,
\&                             \-domain=>\*(Aq.capricorn.org\*(Aq,
\&                             \-secure=>1);
\&    print header(\-cookie=>$cookie);
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB\f(BIcookie()\fB\fR creates a new cookie.  Its parameters include:
.IP "\fB\-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-name"
The name of the cookie (required).  This can be any string at all.
Although browsers limit their cookie names to non-whitespace
alphanumeric characters, \s-1CGI\s0.pm removes this restriction by escaping
and unescaping cookies behind the scenes.
.IP "\fB\-value\fR" 4
.IX Item "-value"
The value of the cookie.  This can be any scalar value,
array reference, or even hash reference.  For example,
you can store an entire hash into a cookie this way:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        $cookie=cookie(\-name=>\*(Aqfamily information\*(Aq,
\&                               \-value=>\e%childrens_ages);
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-path\fR" 4
.IX Item "-path"
The optional partial path for which this cookie will be valid, as described
above.
.IP "\fB\-domain\fR" 4
.IX Item "-domain"
The optional partial domain for which this cookie will be valid, as described
above.
.IP "\fB\-expires\fR" 4
.IX Item "-expires"
The optional expiration date for this cookie.  The format is as described 
in the section on the \fB\f(BIheader()\fB\fR method:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        "+1h"  one hour from now
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-secure\fR" 4
.IX Item "-secure"
If set to true, this cookie will only be used within a secure
\&\s-1SSL\s0 session.
.PP
The cookie created by \fIcookie()\fR must be incorporated into the \s-1HTTP\s0
header within the string returned by the \fIheader()\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        use CGI \*(Aq:standard\*(Aq;
\&        print header(\-cookie=>$my_cookie);
.Ve
.PP
To create multiple cookies, give \fIheader()\fR an array reference:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        $cookie1 = cookie(\-name=>\*(Aqriddle_name\*(Aq,
\&                                  \-value=>"The Sphynx\*(Aqs Question");
\&        $cookie2 = cookie(\-name=>\*(Aqanswers\*(Aq,
\&                                  \-value=>\e%answers);
\&        print header(\-cookie=>[$cookie1,$cookie2]);
.Ve
.PP
To retrieve a cookie, request it by name by calling \fIcookie()\fR method
without the \fB\-value\fR parameter. This example uses the object-oriented
form:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        use CGI;
\&        $query = CGI\->new;
\&        $riddle = $query\->cookie(\*(Aqriddle_name\*(Aq);
\&        %answers = $query\->cookie(\*(Aqanswers\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Cookies created with a single scalar value, such as the \*(L"riddle_name\*(R"
cookie, will be returned in that form.  Cookies with array and hash
values can also be retrieved.
.PP
The cookie and \s-1CGI\s0 namespaces are separate.  If you have a parameter
named 'answers' and a cookie named 'answers', the values retrieved by
\&\fIparam()\fR and \fIcookie()\fR are independent of each other.  However, it's
simple to turn a \s-1CGI\s0 parameter into a cookie, and vice-versa:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   # turn a CGI parameter into a cookie
\&   $c=cookie(\-name=>\*(Aqanswers\*(Aq,\-value=>[param(\*(Aqanswers\*(Aq)]);
\&   # vice\-versa
\&   param(\-name=>\*(Aqanswers\*(Aq,\-value=>[cookie(\*(Aqanswers\*(Aq)]);
.Ve
.PP
If you call \fIcookie()\fR without any parameters, it will return a list of
the names of all cookies passed to your script:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @cookies = cookie();
.Ve
.PP
See the \fBcookie.cgi\fR example script for some ideas on how to use
cookies effectively.
.SH "WORKING WITH FRAMES"
.IX Header "WORKING WITH FRAMES"
It's possible for \s-1CGI\s0.pm scripts to write into several browser panels
and windows using the \s-1HTML 4\s0 frame mechanism.  There are three
techniques for defining new frames programmatically:
.IP "1. Create a <Frameset> document" 4
.IX Item "1. Create a <Frameset> document"
After writing out the \s-1HTTP\s0 header, instead of creating a standard
\&\s-1HTML\s0 document using the \fIstart_html()\fR call, create a <frameset> 
document that defines the frames on the page.  Specify your script(s)
(with appropriate parameters) as the \s-1SRC\s0 for each of the frames.
.Sp
There is no specific support for creating <frameset> sections 
in \s-1CGI\s0.pm, but the \s-1HTML\s0 is very simple to write.
.IP "2. Specify the destination for the document in the \s-1HTTP\s0 header" 4
.IX Item "2. Specify the destination for the document in the HTTP header"
You may provide a \fB\-target\fR parameter to the \fIheader()\fR method:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print header(\-target=>\*(AqResultsWindow\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
This will tell the browser to load the output of your script into the
frame named \*(L"ResultsWindow\*(R".  If a frame of that name doesn't already
exist, the browser will pop up a new window and load your script's
document into that.  There are a number of magic names that you can
use for targets.  See the \s-1HTML \s0\f(CW\*(C`<frame>\*(C'\fR documentation for details.
.IP "3. Specify the destination for the document in the <form> tag" 4
.IX Item "3. Specify the destination for the document in the <form> tag"
You can specify the frame to load in the \s-1FORM\s0 tag itself.  With
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm it looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print start_form(\-target=>\*(AqResultsWindow\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
When your script is reinvoked by the form, its output will be loaded
into the frame named \*(L"ResultsWindow\*(R".  If one doesn't already exist
a new window will be created.
.PP
The script \*(L"frameset.cgi\*(R" in the examples directory shows one way to
create pages in which the fill-out form and the response live in
side-by-side frames.
.SH "SUPPORT FOR JAVASCRIPT"
.IX Header "SUPPORT FOR JAVASCRIPT"
The usual way to use JavaScript is to define a set of functions in a
<\s-1SCRIPT\s0> block inside the \s-1HTML\s0 header and then to register event
handlers in the various elements of the page. Events include such
things as the mouse passing over a form element, a button being
clicked, the contents of a text field changing, or a form being
submitted. When an event occurs that involves an element that has
registered an event handler, its associated JavaScript code gets
called.
.PP
The elements that can register event handlers include the <\s-1BODY\s0> of an
\&\s-1HTML\s0 document, hypertext links, all the various elements of a fill-out
form, and the form itself. There are a large number of events, and

In order to register a JavaScript event handler with an \s-1HTML\s0 element,
just use the event name as a parameter when you call the corresponding
\&\s-1CGI\s0 method. For example, to have your \fIvalidateAge()\fR JavaScript code
executed every time the textfield named \*(L"age\*(R" changes, generate the
field like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& print textfield(\-name=>\*(Aqage\*(Aq,\-onChange=>"validateAge(this)");
.Ve
.PP
This example assumes that you've already declared the \fIvalidateAge()\fR
function by incorporating it into a <\s-1SCRIPT\s0> block. The \s-1CGI\s0.pm
\&\fIstart_html()\fR method provides a convenient way to create this section.
.PP
Similarly, you can create a form that checks itself over for
consistency and alerts the user if some essential value is missing by
creating it this way: 
  print start_form(\-onSubmit=>\*(L"validateMe(this)\*(R");
.PP
See the javascript.cgi script for a demonstration of how this all
works.
.SH "LIMITED SUPPORT FOR CASCADING STYLE SHEETS"
.IX Header "LIMITED SUPPORT FOR CASCADING STYLE SHEETS"
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm has limited support for \s-1HTML3\s0's cascading style sheets (css).
To incorporate a stylesheet into your document, pass the
\&\fIstart_html()\fR method a \fB\-style\fR parameter.  The value of this
parameter may be a scalar, in which case it is treated as the source
\&\s-1URL\s0 for the stylesheet, or it may be a hash reference.  In the latter
case you should provide the hash with one or more of \fB\-src\fR or
\&\fB\-code\fR.  \fB\-src\fR points to a \s-1URL\s0 where an externally-defined
stylesheet can be found.  \fB\-code\fR points to a scalar value to be
incorporated into a <style> section.  Style definitions in \fB\-code\fR
override similarly-named ones in \fB\-src\fR, hence the name \*(L"cascading.\*(R"
.PP
You may also specify the type of the stylesheet by adding the optional
\&\fB\-type\fR parameter to the hash pointed to by \fB\-style\fR.  If not
specified, the style defaults to 'text/css'.
.PP
To refer to a style within the body of your document, add the
\&\fB\-class\fR parameter to any \s-1HTML\s0 element:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print h1({\-class=>\*(AqFancy\*(Aq},\*(AqWelcome to the Party\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Or define styles on the fly with the \fB\-style\fR parameter:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print h1({\-style=>\*(AqColor: red;\*(Aq},\*(AqWelcome to Hell\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
You may also use the new \fB\f(BIspan()\fB\fR element to apply a style to a
section of text:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    print span({\-style=>\*(AqColor: red;\*(Aq},
\&               h1(\*(AqWelcome to Hell\*(Aq),
\&               "Where did that handbasket get to?"
\&               );
.Ve
.PP
Note that you must import the \*(L":html3\*(R" definitions to have the
\&\fB\f(BIspan()\fB\fR method available.  Here's a quick and dirty example of using
\&\s-1CSS\s0's.  See the \s-1CSS\s0 specification at
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ for more information.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use CGI qw/:standard :html3/;

\&          span({\-style=>\*(Aqcolor: magenta\*(Aq},
\&               "Look Mom, no hands!",
\&               p(),
\&               "Whooo wee!"
\&               );
\&    print end_html;
.Ve
.PP
Pass an array reference to \fB\-code\fR or \fB\-src\fR in order to incorporate
multiple stylesheets into your document.
.PP
Should you wish to incorporate a verbatim stylesheet that includes
arbitrary formatting in the header, you may pass a \-verbatim tag to
the \-style hash, as follows:
.PP
print start_html (\-style  =>  {\-verbatim => '@import url(\*(L"/server\-common/css/'.$cssFile.'\*(R");',
                  \-src    =>  '/server\-common/css/core.css'});
.PP
This will generate an \s-1HTML\s0 header that contains this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"  href="/server\-common/css/core.css">
\&   <style type="text/css">
\&   @import url("/server\-common/css/main.css");
\&   </style>
.Ve
.PP
Any additional arguments passed in the \-style value will be
incorporated into the <link> tag.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& start_html(\-style=>{\-src=>[\*(Aq/styles/print.css\*(Aq,\*(Aq/styles/layout.css\*(Aq],
\&                          \-media => \*(Aqall\*(Aq});
.Ve
.PP
This will give:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/print.css" media="all"/>
\& <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/layout.css" media="all"/>
.Ve
.PP
<p>
.PP
To make more complicated <link> tags, use the \fILink()\fR function
and pass it to \fIstart_html()\fR in the \-head argument, as in:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  @h = (Link({\-rel=>\*(Aqstylesheet\*(Aq,\-type=>\*(Aqtext/css\*(Aq,\-src=>\*(Aq/ss/ss.css\*(Aq,\-media=>\*(Aqall\*(Aq}),
\&        Link({\-rel=>\*(Aqstylesheet\*(Aq,\-type=>\*(Aqtext/css\*(Aq,\-src=>\*(Aq/ss/fred.css\*(Aq,\-media=>\*(Aqpaper\*(Aq}));
\&  print start_html({\-head=>\e@h})
.Ve
.PP
To create primary and  \*(L"alternate\*(R" stylesheet, use the \fB\-alternate\fR option:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& start_html(\-style=>{\-src=>[
\&                           {\-src=>\*(Aq/styles/print.css\*(Aq},
\&                           {\-src=>\*(Aq/styles/alt.css\*(Aq,\-alternate=>1}
\&                           ]
\&                    });
.Ve
.SH "DEBUGGING"
.IX Header "DEBUGGING"
If you are running the script from the command line or in the perl
debugger, you can pass the script a list of keywords or
parameter=value pairs on the command line or from standard input (you
don't have to worry about tricking your script into reading from
environment variables).  You can pass keywords like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    your_script.pl keyword1 keyword2 keyword3
.Ve
.PP
or this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   your_script.pl keyword1+keyword2+keyword3
.Ve
.PP
or this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    your_script.pl name1=value1 name2=value2
.Ve
.PP
or this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    your_script.pl name1=value1&name2=value2
.Ve
.PP
To turn off this feature, use the \-no_debug pragma.
.PP
To test the \s-1POST\s0 method, you may enable full debugging with the \-debug
pragma.  This will allow you to feed newline-delimited name=value
pairs to the script on standard input.
.PP
When debugging, you can use quotes and backslashes to escape 
characters in the familiar shell manner, letting you place
spaces and other funny characters in your parameter=value
pairs:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   your_script.pl "name1=\*(AqI am a long value\*(Aq" "name2=two\e words"
.Ve
.PP
Finally, you can set the path info for the script by prefixing the first
name/value parameter with the path followed by a question mark (?):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    your_script.pl /your/path/here?name1=value1&name2=value2
.Ve
.SS "\s-1DUMPING OUT ALL THE NAME/VALUE PAIRS\s0"
.IX Subsection "DUMPING OUT ALL THE NAME/VALUE PAIRS"

name/value pairs formatted nicely as a nested list.  This is useful
for debugging purposes:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print Dump
.Ve
.PP
Produces something that looks like:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&    <ul>
\&    <li>name1
\&        <ul>
\&        <li>value1

As a shortcut, you can interpolate the entire \s-1CGI\s0 object into a string
and it will be replaced with the a nice \s-1HTML\s0 dump shown above:

.SH "FETCHING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "FETCHING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
Some of the more useful environment variables can be fetched
through this interface.  The methods are as follows:
.IP "\fB\f(BIAccept()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "Accept()"
Return a list of \s-1MIME\s0 types that the remote browser accepts. If you
give this method a single argument corresponding to a \s-1MIME\s0 type, as in
Accept('text/html'), it will return a floating point value
corresponding to the browser's preference for this type from 0.0
(don't want) to 1.0.  Glob types (e.g. text/*) in the browser's accept
list are handled correctly.
.Sp
Note that the capitalization changed between version 2.43 and 2.44 in
order to avoid conflict with Perl's \fIaccept()\fR function.
.IP "\fB\f(BIraw_cookie()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "raw_cookie()"
Returns the \s-1HTTP_COOKIE\s0 variable.  Cookies have a special format, and
this method call just returns the raw form (?cookie dough).  See
\&\fIcookie()\fR for ways of setting and retrieving cooked cookies.
.Sp
Called with no parameters, \fIraw_cookie()\fR returns the packed cookie
structure.  You can separate it into individual cookies by splitting
on the character sequence \*(L"; \*(R".  Called with the name of a cookie,
retrieves the \fBunescaped\fR form of the cookie.  You can use the
regular \fIcookie()\fR method to get the names, or use the \fIraw_fetch()\fR
method from the CGI::Cookie module.
.IP "\fB\f(BIuser_agent()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "user_agent()"
Returns the \s-1HTTP_USER_AGENT\s0 variable.  If you give
this method a single argument, it will attempt to
pattern match on it, allowing you to do something
like user_agent(Mozilla);
.IP "\fB\f(BIpath_info()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "path_info()"
Returns additional path information from the script \s-1URL.
E.G.\s0 fetching /cgi\-bin/your_script/additional/stuff will result in
\&\fIpath_info()\fR returning \*(L"/additional/stuff\*(R".
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 The Microsoft Internet Information Server
is broken with respect to additional path information.  If
you use the Perl \s-1DLL\s0 library, the \s-1IIS\s0 server will attempt to
execute the additional path information as a Perl script.
If you use the ordinary file associations mapping, the
path information will be present in the environment, 
but incorrect.  The best thing to do is to avoid using additional
path information in \s-1CGI\s0 scripts destined for use with \s-1IIS.\s0
.IP "\fB\f(BIpath_translated()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "path_translated()"
As per \fIpath_info()\fR but returns the additional
path information translated into a physical path, e.g.
\&\*(L"/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/additional/stuff\*(R".
.Sp
The Microsoft \s-1IIS\s0 is broken with respect to the translated
path as well.
.IP "\fB\f(BIremote_host()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "remote_host()"
Returns either the remote host name or \s-1IP\s0 address.
if the former is unavailable.
.IP "\fB\f(BIremote_addr()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "remote_addr()"
Returns the remote host \s-1IP\s0 address, or 
127.0.0.1 if the address is unavailable.
.IP "\fB\f(BIscript_name()\fB\fR Return the script name as a partial \s-1URL,\s0 for self-referring scripts." 4
.IX Item "script_name() Return the script name as a partial URL, for self-referring scripts."
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\f(BIreferer()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "referer()"
.PD
Return the \s-1URL\s0 of the page the browser was viewing
prior to fetching your script.  Not available for all
browsers.
.IP "\fBauth_type ()\fR" 4
.IX Item "auth_type ()"
Return the authorization/verification method in use for this
script, if any.
.IP "\fBserver_name ()\fR" 4
.IX Item "server_name ()"
Returns the name of the server, usually the machine's host
name.
.IP "\fBvirtual_host ()\fR" 4
.IX Item "virtual_host ()"
When using virtual hosts, returns the name of the host that
the browser attempted to contact
.IP "\fBserver_port ()\fR" 4
.IX Item "server_port ()"
Return the port that the server is listening on.
.IP "\fBvirtual_port ()\fR" 4
.IX Item "virtual_port ()"
Like \fIserver_port()\fR except that it takes virtual hosts into account.
Use this when running with virtual hosts.
.IP "\fBserver_software ()\fR" 4
.IX Item "server_software ()"
Returns the server software and version number.
.IP "\fBremote_user ()\fR" 4
.IX Item "remote_user ()"
Return the authorization/verification name used for user
verification, if this script is protected.
.IP "\fBuser_name ()\fR" 4
.IX Item "user_name ()"
Attempt to obtain the remote user's name, using a variety of different
techniques.  This only works with older browsers such as Mosaic.
Newer browsers do not report the user name for privacy reasons!
.IP "\fB\f(BIrequest_method()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "request_method()"
Returns the method used to access your script, usually
one of '\s-1POST\s0', '\s-1GET\s0' or '\s-1HEAD\s0'.
.IP "\fB\f(BIcontent_type()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "content_type()"
Returns the content_type of data submitted in a \s-1POST,\s0 generally 
multipart/form\-data or application/x\-www\-form\-urlencoded
.IP "\fB\f(BIhttp()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "http()"
Called with no arguments returns the list of \s-1HTTP\s0 environment
variables, including such things as \s-1HTTP_USER_AGENT,
HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE,\s0 and \s-1HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET,\s0 corresponding to the
like-named \s-1HTTP\s0 header fields in the request.  Called with the name of
an \s-1HTTP\s0 header field, returns its value.  Capitalization and the use
of hyphens versus underscores are not significant.
.Sp
For example, all three of these examples are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   $requested_language = http(\*(AqAccept\-language\*(Aq);

.SH "USING NPH SCRIPTS"
.IX Header "USING NPH SCRIPTS"
\&\s-1NPH,\s0 or \*(L"no-parsed-header\*(R", scripts bypass the server completely by
sending the complete \s-1HTTP\s0 header directly to the browser.  This has
slight performance benefits, but is of most use for taking advantage
of \s-1HTTP\s0 extensions that are not directly supported by your server,
such as server push and \s-1PICS\s0 headers.
.PP
Servers use a variety of conventions for designating \s-1CGI\s0 scripts as
\&\s-1NPH. \s0 Many Unix servers look at the beginning of the script's name for
the prefix \*(L"nph\-\*(R".  The Macintosh WebSTAR server and Microsoft's
Internet Information Server, in contrast, try to decide whether a
program is an \s-1NPH\s0 script by examining the first line of script output.
.PP
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm supports \s-1NPH\s0 scripts with a special \s-1NPH\s0 mode.  When in this
mode, \s-1CGI\s0.pm will output the necessary extra header information when
the \fIheader()\fR and \fIredirect()\fR methods are
called.
.PP
The Microsoft Internet Information Server requires \s-1NPH\s0 mode.  As of
version 2.30, \s-1CGI\s0.pm will automatically detect when the script is
running under \s-1IIS\s0 and put itself into this mode.  You do not need to
do this manually, although it won't hurt anything if you do.  However,
note that if you have applied Service Pack 6, much of the
functionality of \s-1NPH\s0 scripts, including the ability to redirect while
setting a cookie, \fBdo not work at all\fR on \s-1IIS\s0 without a special patch
from Microsoft.  See

You are also advised to put the script into \s-1NPH\s0 mode and to set $| to

This script initializes server push by calling \fB\f(BImultipart_init()\fB\fR.
It then enters a loop in which it begins a new multipart section by
calling \fB\f(BImultipart_start()\fB\fR, prints the current local time,
and ends a multipart section with \fB\f(BImultipart_end()\fB\fR.  It then sleeps
a second, and begins again. On the final iteration, it ends the
multipart section with \fB\f(BImultipart_final()\fB\fR rather than with

megabytes.  \s-1CGI\s0.pm will attempt to read the entire \s-1POST\s0 into a
variable, growing hugely in size until it runs out of memory.  While
the script attempts to allocate the memory the system may slow down
dramatically.  This is a form of denial of service attack.
.PP
Another possible attack is for the remote user to force \s-1CGI\s0.pm to
accept a huge file upload.  \s-1CGI\s0.pm will accept the upload and store it
in a temporary directory even if your script doesn't expect to receive
an uploaded file.  \s-1CGI\s0.pm will delete the file automatically when it
terminates, but in the meantime the remote user may have filled up the
server's disk space, causing problems for other programs.
.PP
The best way to avoid denial of service attacks is to limit the amount
of memory, \s-1CPU\s0 time and disk space that \s-1CGI\s0 scripts can use.  Some Web
servers come with built-in facilities to accomplish this. In other
cases, you can use the shell \fIlimit\fR or \fIulimit\fR
commands to put ceilings on \s-1CGI\s0 resource usage.
.PP
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm also has some simple built-in protections against denial of
service attacks, but you must activate them before you can use them.
These take the form of two global variables in the \s-1CGI\s0 name space:
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB$CGI::POST_MAX\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CB$CGI::POST_MAX\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$CGI::POST_MAX"
If set to a non-negative integer, this variable puts a ceiling
on the size of POSTings, in bytes.  If \s-1CGI\s0.pm detects a \s-1POST\s0
that is greater than the ceiling, it will immediately exit with an error
message.  This value will affect both ordinary POSTs and
multipart POSTs, meaning that it limits the maximum size of file
uploads as well.  You should set this to a reasonably high
value, such as 1 megabyte.
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB$CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CB$CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS"
If set to a non-zero value, this will disable file uploads
completely.  Other fill-out form values will work as usual.
.PP
You can use these variables in either of two ways.
.IP "\fB1. On a script-by-script basis\fR" 4
.IX Item "1. On a script-by-script basis"
Set the variable at the top of the script, right after the \*(L"use\*(R" statement:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    use CGI qw/:standard/;
\&    use CGI::Carp \*(AqfatalsToBrowser\*(Aq;
\&    $CGI::POST_MAX=1024 * 100;  # max 100K posts
\&    $CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS = 1;  # no uploads
.Ve
.IP "\fB2. Globally for all scripts\fR" 4
.IX Item "2. Globally for all scripts"
Open up \s-1CGI\s0.pm, find the definitions for \f(CW$POST_MAX\fR and 
\&\f(CW$DISABLE_UPLOADS\fR, and set them to the desired values.  You'll 
find them towards the top of the file in a subroutine named 
\&\fIinitialize_globals()\fR.
.PP
An attempt to send a \s-1POST\s0 larger than \f(CW$POST_MAX\fR bytes will cause
\&\fI\fIparam()\fI\fR to return an empty \s-1CGI\s0 parameter list.  You can test for
this event by checking \fI\fIcgi_error()\fI\fR, either after you create the \s-1CGI\s0
object or, if you are using the function-oriented interface, call
<\fIparam()\fR> for the first time.  If the \s-1POST\s0 was intercepted, then
\&\fIcgi_error()\fR will return the message \*(L"413 \s-1POST\s0 too large\*(R".
.PP
This error message is actually defined by the \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol, and is
designed to be returned to the browser as the \s-1CGI\s0 script's status
 code.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   $uploaded_file = param(\*(Aqupload\*(Aq);
\&   if (!$uploaded_file && cgi_error()) {
\&      print header(\-status=>cgi_error());
\&      exit 0;
\&   }
.Ve
.PP
However it isn't clear that any browser currently knows what to do
with this status code.  It might be better just to create an
\&\s-1HTML\s0 page that warns the user of the problem.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY WITH CGI\-LIB.PL"
.IX Header "COMPATIBILITY WITH CGI-LIB.PL"
To make it easier to port existing programs that use cgi\-lib.pl the
compatibility routine \*(L"ReadParse\*(R" is provided.  Porting is simple:
.PP
\&\s-1OLD VERSION\s0
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    require "cgi\-lib.pl";
\&    &ReadParse;
\&    print "The value of the antique is $in{antique}.\en";
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1NEW VERSION\s0
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use CGI;
\&    CGI::ReadParse();
\&    print "The value of the antique is $in{antique}.\en";
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1CGI\s0.pm's \fIReadParse()\fR routine creates a tied variable named \f(CW%in\fR,
which can be accessed to obtain the query variables.  Like
ReadParse, you can also provide your own variable.  Infrequently
used features of ReadParse, such as the creation of \f(CW@in\fR and \f(CW$in\fR
variables, are not supported.
.PP
Once you use ReadParse, you can retrieve the query object itself
this way:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $q = $in{CGI};
\&    print $q\->textfield(\-name=>\*(Aqwow\*(Aq,
\&            \-value=>\*(Aqdoes this really work?\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
This allows you to start using the more interesting features
of \s-1CGI\s0.pm without rewriting your old scripts from scratch.
.PP
An even simpler way to mix cgi-lib calls with \s-1CGI\s0.pm calls is to import both the
\&\f(CW\*(C`:cgi\-lib\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`:standard\*(C'\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& use CGI qw(:cgi\-lib :standard);
\& &ReadParse;
\& print "The price of your purchase is $in{price}.\en";
\& print textfield(\-name=>\*(Aqprice\*(Aq, \-default=>\*(Aq$1.99\*(Aq);
.Ve
.SS "Cgi-lib functions that are available in \s-1CGI\s0.pm"
.IX Subsection "Cgi-lib functions that are available in CGI.pm"

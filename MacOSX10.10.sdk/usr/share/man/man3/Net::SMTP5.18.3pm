Net::SMTP \- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&    use Net::SMTP;
\&
\&    # Constructors
\&    $smtp = Net::SMTP\->new(\*(Aqmailhost\*(Aq);
\&    $smtp = Net::SMTP\->new(\*(Aqmailhost\*(Aq, Timeout => 60);
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module implements a client interface to the \s-1SMTP\s0 and \s-1ESMTP\s0
protocol, enabling a perl5 application to talk to \s-1SMTP\s0 servers. This
documentation assumes that you are familiar with the concepts of the
\&\s-1SMTP\s0 protocol described in \s-1RFC821.\s0
.PP
A new Net::SMTP object must be created with the \fInew\fR method. Once
this has been done, all \s-1SMTP\s0 commands are accessed through this object.
.PP
The Net::SMTP class is a subclass of Net::Cmd and IO::Socket::INET.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
This example prints the mail domain name of the \s-1SMTP\s0 server known as mailhost:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/perl \-w
\&
\&    use Net::SMTP;
\&
\&    $smtp = Net::SMTP\->new(\*(Aqmailhost\*(Aq);
\&    print $smtp\->domain,"\en";
\&    $smtp\->quit;
.Ve
.PP
This example sends a small message to the postmaster at the \s-1SMTP\s0 server
known as mailhost:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/perl \-w
\&
\&    use Net::SMTP;
\&
\&    $smtp = Net::SMTP\->new(\*(Aqmailhost\*(Aq);

.SH "CONSTRUCTOR"
.IX Header "CONSTRUCTOR"
.IP "new ( [ \s-1HOST \s0] [, \s-1OPTIONS \s0] )" 4
.IX Item "new ( [ HOST ] [, OPTIONS ] )"
This is the constructor for a new Net::SMTP object. \f(CW\*(C`HOST\*(C'\fR is the
name of the remote host to which an \s-1SMTP\s0 connection is required.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`HOST\*(C'\fR is optional. If \f(CW\*(C`HOST\*(C'\fR is not given then it may instead be
passed as the \f(CW\*(C`Host\*(C'\fR option described below. If neither is given then
the \f(CW\*(C`SMTP_Hosts\*(C'\fR specified in \f(CW\*(C`Net::Config\*(C'\fR will be used.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`OPTIONS\*(C'\fR are passed in a hash like fashion, using key and value pairs.
Possible options are:
.Sp
\&\fBHello\fR \- \s-1SMTP\s0 requires that you identify yourself. This option
specifies a string to pass as your mail domain. If not given localhost.localdomain
will be used.
.Sp
\&\fBHost\fR \- \s-1SMTP\s0 host to connect to. It may be a single scalar, as defined for
the \f(CW\*(C`PeerAddr\*(C'\fR option in IO::Socket::INET, or a reference to
an array with hosts to try in turn. The \*(L"host\*(R" method will return the value
which was used to connect to the host.
.Sp
\&\fBLocalAddr\fR and \fBLocalPort\fR \- These parameters are passed directly
to IO::Socket to allow binding the socket to a local port.
.Sp
\&\fBTimeout\fR \- Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the
\&\s-1SMTP\s0 server (default: 120)
.Sp
\&\fBExactAddresses\fR \- If true the all \s-1ADDRESS\s0 arguments must be as
defined by \f(CW\*(C`addr\-spec\*(C'\fR in \s-1RFC2822.\s0 If not given, or false, then
Net::SMTP will attempt to extract the address from the value passed.
.Sp
\&\fBDebug\fR \- Enable debugging information
.Sp
Example:

.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
Unless otherwise stated all methods return either a \fItrue\fR or \fIfalse\fR
value, with \fItrue\fR meaning that the operation was a success. When a method
states that it returns a value, failure will be returned as \fIundef\fR or an
empty list.
.IP "banner ()" 4
.IX Item "banner ()"
Returns the banner message which the server replied with when the
initial connection was made.
.IP "domain ()" 4
.IX Item "domain ()"
Returns the domain that the remote \s-1SMTP\s0 server identified itself as during
connection.
.IP "hello ( \s-1DOMAIN \s0)" 4
.IX Item "hello ( DOMAIN )"
Tell the remote server the mail domain which you are in using the \s-1EHLO\s0
command (or \s-1HELO\s0 if \s-1EHLO\s0 fails).  Since this method is invoked
automatically when the Net::SMTP object is constructed the user should
normally not have to call it manually.
.IP "host ()" 4
.IX Item "host ()"
Returns the value used by the constructor, and passed to IO::Socket::INET,
to connect to the host.
.IP "etrn ( \s-1DOMAIN \s0)" 4
.IX Item "etrn ( DOMAIN )"
Request a queue run for the \s-1DOMAIN\s0 given.
.IP "auth ( \s-1USERNAME, PASSWORD \s0)" 4
.IX Item "auth ( USERNAME, PASSWORD )"
Attempt \s-1SASL\s0 authentication.
.IP "mail ( \s-1ADDRESS\s0 [, \s-1OPTIONS\s0] )" 4
.IX Item "mail ( ADDRESS [, OPTIONS] )"
.PD 0
.IP "send ( \s-1ADDRESS \s0)" 4
.IX Item "send ( ADDRESS )"
.IP "send_or_mail ( \s-1ADDRESS \s0)" 4
.IX Item "send_or_mail ( ADDRESS )"
.IP "send_and_mail ( \s-1ADDRESS \s0)" 4
.IX Item "send_and_mail ( ADDRESS )"
.PD
Send the appropriate command to the server \s-1MAIL, SEND, SOML\s0 or \s-1SAML. \s0\f(CW\*(C`ADDRESS\*(C'\fR
is the address of the sender. This initiates the sending of a message. The
method \f(CW\*(C`recipient\*(C'\fR should be called for each address that the message is to
be sent to.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`mail\*(C'\fR method can some additional \s-1ESMTP OPTIONS\s0 which is passed
in hash like fashion, using key and value pairs.  Possible options are:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\& Size        => <bytes>
\& Return      => "FULL" | "HDRS"
\& Bits        => "7" | "8" | "binary"
\& Transaction => <ADDRESS>
\& Envelope    => <ENVID>     # xtext\-encodes its argument
\& ENVID       => <ENVID>     # similar to Envelope, but expects argument encoded
\& XVERP       => 1
\& AUTH        => <submitter> # encoded address according to RFC 2554
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`Return\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Envelope\*(C'\fR parameters are used for \s-1DSN \s0(Delivery
Status Notification).
.Sp
The submitter address in \f(CW\*(C`AUTH\*(C'\fR option is expected to be in a format as
required by \s-1RFC 2554,\s0 in an RFC2821\-quoted form and xtext-encoded, or <> .
.IP "reset ()" 4
.IX Item "reset ()"
Reset the status of the server. This may be called after a message has been 
initiated, but before any data has been sent, to cancel the sending of the
message.
.IP "recipient ( \s-1ADDRESS\s0 [, \s-1ADDRESS,\s0 [...]] [, \s-1OPTIONS \s0] )" 4
.IX Item "recipient ( ADDRESS [, ADDRESS, [...]] [, OPTIONS ] )"
Notify the server that the current message should be sent to all of the
addresses given. Each address is sent as a separate command to the server.
Should the sending of any address result in a failure then the process is
aborted and a \fIfalse\fR value is returned. It is up to the user to call
\&\f(CW\*(C`reset\*(C'\fR if they so desire.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`recipient\*(C'\fR method can also pass additional case-sensitive \s-1OPTIONS\s0 as an
anonymous hash using key and value pairs.  Possible options are:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  Notify  => [\*(AqNEVER\*(Aq] or [\*(AqSUCCESS\*(Aq,\*(AqFAILURE\*(Aq,\*(AqDELAY\*(Aq]  (see below)
\&  ORcpt   => <ORCPT>
\&  SkipBad => 1        (to ignore bad addresses)
.Ve
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`SkipBad\*(C'\fR is true the \f(CW\*(C`recipient\*(C'\fR will not return an error when a bad
address is encountered and it will return an array of addresses that did
succeed.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  $smtp\->recipient($recipient1,$recipient2);  # Good
\&  $smtp\->recipient($recipient1,$recipient2, { SkipBad => 1 });  # Good
\&  $smtp\->recipient($recipient1,$recipient2, { Notify => [\*(AqFAILURE\*(Aq,\*(AqDELAY\*(Aq], SkipBad => 1 });  # Good
\&  @goodrecips=$smtp\->recipient(@recipients, { Notify => [\*(AqFAILURE\*(Aq], SkipBad => 1 });  # Good
\&  $smtp\->recipient("$recipient,$recipient2"); # BAD
.Ve
.Sp
Notify is used to request Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs), but your
\&\s-1SMTP/ESMTP\s0 service may not respect this request depending upon its version and
your site's \s-1SMTP\s0 configuration.
.Sp
Leaving out the Notify option usually defaults an \s-1SMTP\s0 service to its default
behavior equivalent to ['\s-1FAILURE\s0'] notifications only, but again this may be
dependent upon your site's \s-1SMTP\s0 configuration.
.Sp
The \s-1NEVER\s0 keyword must appear by itself if used within the Notify option and \*(L"requests
that a \s-1DSN\s0 not be returned to the sender under any conditions.\*(R"
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  {Notify => [\*(AqNEVER\*(Aq]}
\&
\&  $smtp\->recipient(@recipients, { Notify => [\*(AqNEVER\*(Aq], SkipBad => 1 });  # Good
.Ve
.Sp
You may use any combination of these three values '\s-1SUCCESS\s0','\s-1FAILURE\s0','\s-1DELAY\s0' in
the anonymous array reference as defined by \s-1RFC3461 \s0(see http://rfc.net/rfc3461.html
for more information.  Note: quotations in this topic from same.).
.Sp
A Notify parameter of '\s-1SUCCESS\s0' or '\s-1FAILURE\s0' \*(L"requests that a \s-1DSN\s0 be issued on
successful delivery or delivery failure, respectively.\*(R"
.Sp
A Notify parameter of '\s-1DELAY\s0' \*(L"indicates the sender's willingness to receive
delayed DSNs.  Delayed DSNs may be issued if delivery of a message has been
delayed for an unusual amount of time (as determined by the Message Transfer
Agent (\s-1MTA\s0) at which the message is delayed), but the final delivery status
(whether successful or failure) cannot be determined.  The absence of the \s-1DELAY\s0
keyword in a \s-1NOTIFY\s0 parameter requests that a \*(R"delayed\*(L" \s-1DSN NOT\s0 be issued under
any conditions.\*(R"
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  {Notify => [\*(AqSUCCESS\*(Aq,\*(AqFAILURE\*(Aq,\*(AqDELAY\*(Aq]}
\&
\&  $smtp\->recipient(@recipients, { Notify => [\*(AqFAILURE\*(Aq,\*(AqDELAY\*(Aq], SkipBad => 1 });  # Good
.Ve
.Sp
ORcpt is also part of the \s-1SMTP DSN\s0 extension according to \s-1RFC3461.\s0
It is used to pass along the original recipient that the mail was first
sent to.  The machine that generates a \s-1DSN\s0 will use this address to inform
the sender, because he can't know if recipients get rewritten by mail servers.
It is expected to be in a format as required by \s-1RFC3461,\s0 xtext-encoded.

.PD
Synonyms for \f(CW\*(C`recipient\*(C'\fR.
.IP "data ( [ \s-1DATA \s0] )" 4
.IX Item "data ( [ DATA ] )"
Initiate the sending of the data from the current message.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`DATA\*(C'\fR may be a reference to a list or a list. If specified the contents
of \f(CW\*(C`DATA\*(C'\fR and a termination string \f(CW".\er\en"\fR is sent to the server. And the
result will be true if the data was accepted.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`DATA\*(C'\fR is not specified then the result will indicate that the server
wishes the data to be sent. The data must then be sent using the \f(CW\*(C`datasend\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`dataend\*(C'\fR methods described in Net::Cmd.
.IP "expand ( \s-1ADDRESS \s0)" 4
.IX Item "expand ( ADDRESS )"
Request the server to expand the given address Returns an array
which contains the text read from the server.
.IP "verify ( \s-1ADDRESS \s0)" 4
.IX Item "verify ( ADDRESS )"
Verify that \f(CW\*(C`ADDRESS\*(C'\fR is a legitimate mailing address.
.Sp
Most sites usually disable this feature in their \s-1SMTP\s0 service configuration.
Use \*(L"Debug => 1\*(R" option under \fInew()\fR to see if disabled.
.ie n .IP "help ( [ $subject ] )" 4
.el .IP "help ( [ \f(CW$subject\fR ] )" 4
.IX Item "help ( [ $subject ] )"
Request help text from the server. Returns the text or undef upon failure
.IP "quit ()" 4
.IX Item "quit ()"
Send the \s-1QUIT\s0 command to the remote \s-1SMTP\s0 server and close the socket connection.
.SH "ADDRESSES"
.IX Header "ADDRESSES"
Net::SMTP attempts to \s-1DWIM\s0 with addresses that are passed. For
example an application might extract The From: line from an email
and pass that to \fImail()\fR. While this may work, it is not recommended.
The application should really use a module like Mail::Address
to extract the mail address and pass that.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`ExactAddresses\*(C'\fR is passed to the constructor, then addresses
should be a valid rfc2821\-quoted address, although Net::SMTP will
accept accept the address surrounded by angle brackets.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate, read,
and write Zip archive files.
.PP
Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
.PP
Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings. Members
can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and enumerated.
They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments, or other attributes
queried or modified. Their data can be compressed or uncompressed as needed.
.PP
Members can be created from members in existing Zip files, or from existing
directories, files, or strings.
.PP
This module uses the Compress::Raw::Zlib library to read and write the
compressed streams inside the files.
.PP
One can use Archive::Zip::MemberRead to read the zip file archive members
as if they were files.
.SS "File Naming"
.IX Subsection "File Naming"
Regardless of what your local file system uses for file naming, names in a
Zip file are in Unix format (\fIforward\fR slashes (/) separating directory
names, etc.).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Archive::Zip\*(C'\fR tries to be consistent with file naming conventions, and will
translate back and forth between native and Zip file names.
.PP
However, it can't guess which format names are in. So two rules control what
kind of file name you must pass various routines:
.IP "Names of files are in local format." 4
.IX Item "Names of files are in local format."
\&\f(CW\*(C`File::Spec\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`File::Basename\*(C'\fR are used for various file
operations. When you're referring to a file on your system, use its
file naming conventions.
.IP "Names of archive members are in Unix format." 4
.IX Item "Names of archive members are in Unix format."
This applies to every method that refers to an archive member, or
provides a name for new archive members. The \f(CW\*(C`extract()\*(C'\fR methods
that can take one or two names will convert from local to zip names
if you call them with a single name.
.SS "Archive::Zip Object Model"
.IX Subsection "Archive::Zip Object Model"
\fIOverview\fR
.IX Subsection "Overview"
.PP
Archive::Zip::Archive objects are what you ordinarily deal with.
These maintain the structure of a zip file, without necessarily
holding data. When a zip is read from a disk file, the (possibly
compressed) data still lives in the file, not in memory. Archive
members hold information about the individual members, but not
(usually) the actual member data. When the zip is written to a
(different) file, the member data is compressed or copied as needed.
It is possible to make archive members whose data is held in a string
in memory, but this is not done when a zip file is read. Directory
members don't have any data.

as inline subroutines, using the \f(CW\*(C`use constant\*(C'\fR pragma. They can be imported
into your namespace using the \f(CW\*(C`:ERROR_CODES\*(C'\fR tag:
.PP

.IP "\s-1AZ_IO_ERROR \\fIs0\fR\|(4)" 4
.IX Item "AZ_IO_ERROR f(ISs0"
There was an \s-1IO\s0 error.
.SS "Compression"
.IX Subsection "Compression"
Archive::Zip allows each member of a \s-1ZIP\s0 file to be compressed (using the
Deflate algorithm) or uncompressed.
.PP
Other compression algorithms that some versions of \s-1ZIP\s0 have been able to
produce are not supported. Each member has two compression methods: the
one it's stored as (this is always \s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 for string and external
file members), and the one you desire for the member in the zip file.
.PP
These can be different, of course, so you can make a zip member that is not
compressed out of one that is, and vice versa.
.PP
You can inquire about the current compression and set the desired
compression method:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $member = $zip\->memberNamed( \*(Aqxyz.txt\*(Aq );
\&  $member\->compressionMethod();    # return current compression
\&
\&  # set to read uncompressed
\&  $member\->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );
\&
\&  # set to read compressed
\&  $member\->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_DEFLATED );
.Ve
.PP
There are two different compression methods:
.IP "\s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_STORED"
File is stored (no compression)
.IP "\s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_DEFLATED"
File is Deflated
.SS "Compression Levels"
.IX Subsection "Compression Levels"
If a member's desiredCompressionMethod is \s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED,\s0 you
can choose different compression levels. This choice may affect the
speed of compression and decompression, as well as the size of the
compressed member data.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $member\->desiredCompressionLevel( 9 );
.Ve
.PP
The levels given can be:
.IP "\(bu" 4
0 or \s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_NONE\s0
.Sp
This is the same as saying
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $member\->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
1 .. 9
.Sp
1 gives the best speed and worst compression, and 9 gives the
best compression and worst speed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_FASTEST\s0
.Sp
This is a synonym for level 1.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_BEST_COMPRESSION\s0
.Sp
This is a synonym for level 9.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT\s0
.Sp
This gives a good compromise between speed and compression,
and is currently equivalent to 6 (this is in the zlib code).
This is the level that will be used if not specified.
.SH "Archive::Zip Methods"
.IX Header "Archive::Zip Methods"
The Archive::Zip class (and its invisible subclass Archive::Zip::Archive)
implement generic zip file functionality. Creating a new Archive::Zip object
actually makes an Archive::Zip::Archive object, but you don't have to worry
about this unless you're subclassing.

.PD
Report or change chunk size used for reading and writing.
This can make big differences in dealing with large files.
Currently, this defaults to 32K. This also changes the chunk
size used for Compress::Raw::Zlib. You must call \fIsetChunkSize()\fR
before reading or writing. This is not exportable, so you
must call it like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( 4096 );
.Ve
.Sp
or as a method on a zip (though this is a global setting).
Returns old chunk size.

Change the subroutine called with error strings. This
defaults to \e&Carp::carp, but you may want to change it to
get the error strings. This is not exportable, so you must
call it like:
.Sp

.Ve
.Sp
If myErrorHandler is undef, resets handler to default.
Returns old error handler. Note that if you call Carp::carp
or a similar routine or if you're chaining to the default
error handler from your error handler, you may want to
increment the number of caller levels that are skipped (do
not just set it to a number):

.PD
Create a uniquely named temp file. It will be returned open
for read/write. If \f(CW$tmpdir\fR is given, it is used as the
name of a directory to create the file in. If not given,
creates the file using \f(CW\*(C`File::Spec::tmpdir()\*(C'\fR. Generally, you can
override this choice using the

\&\f(CW$root\fR is the root of the tree of files and directories to be
added. It is a valid directory name on your system. \f(CW$dest\fR is
the name for the root in the zip file (undef or blank means
to use relative pathnames). It is a valid \s-1ZIP\s0 directory name
(that is, it uses forward slashes (/) for separating
directory components). \f(CW$pred\fR is an optional subroutine
reference to select files: it is passed the name of the
prospective file or directory using \f(CW$_\fR, and if it returns
true, the file or directory will be included. The default is
to add all readable files and directories. For instance,

This reads the next chunk of given size from the member's
data stream and compresses or uncompresses it as necessary,
returning a reference to the bytes read and a status. If size
argument is not given, defaults to global set by
Archive::Zip::setChunkSize. Status is \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success until
the last chunk, where it returns \s-1AZ_STREAM_END.\s0 Returns \f(CW\*(C`(

Rewind data and set up for reading data streams or writing
zip files. Can take options for \f(CW\*(C`inflateInit()\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`deflateInit()\*(C'\fR, but this is not likely to be necessary.
Subclass overrides should call this method. Returns \f(CW\*(C`AZ_OK\*(C'\fR
on success.
.IP "\fIendRead()\fR" 4
.IX Item "endRead()"
Reset the read variables and free the inflater or deflater.
Must be called to close files, etc. Returns \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success.
.IP "\fIreadIsDone()\fR" 4
.IX Item "readIsDone()"
Return true if the read has run out of data or encountered an error.
.IP "\fIcontents()\fR" 4
.IX Item "contents()"
Return the entire uncompressed member data or undef in scalar
context. When called in array context, returns \f(CW\*(C`( $string,
$status )\*(C'\fR; status will be \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    my $string = $member\->contents();

Extract (and uncompress, if necessary) the member's contents
to the given file handle. Return \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success.
.SH "Archive::Zip::FileMember methods"
.IX Header "Archive::Zip::FileMember methods"
The Archive::Zip::FileMember class extends Archive::Zip::Member. It is the
base class for both ZipFileMember and NewFileMember classes. This class adds
an \f(CW\*(C`externalFileName\*(C'\fR and an \f(CW\*(C`fh\*(C'\fR member to keep track of the external
file.
.IP "\fIexternalFileName()\fR" 4
.IX Item "externalFileName()"
Return the member's external filename.
.IP "\fIfh()\fR" 4
.IX Item "fh()"
Return the member's read file handle. Automatically opens file if
necessary.
.SH "Archive::Zip::ZipFileMember methods"
.IX Header "Archive::Zip::ZipFileMember methods"
The Archive::Zip::ZipFileMember class represents members that have been read
from external zip files.
.IP "\fIdiskNumberStart()\fR" 4
.IX Item "diskNumberStart()"
Returns the disk number that the member's local header resides in.
Should be 0.
.IP "\fIlocalHeaderRelativeOffset()\fR" 4
.IX Item "localHeaderRelativeOffset()"
Returns the offset into the zip file where the member's local header
is.
.IP "\fIdataOffset()\fR" 4
.IX Item "dataOffset()"
Returns the offset from the beginning of the zip file to the member's
data.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.IX Header "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.SS "When not to use Archive::Zip"
.IX Subsection "When not to use Archive::Zip"
If you are just going to be extracting zips (and/or other archives) you
are recommended to look at using Archive::Extract instead, as it is much
easier to use and factors out archive-specific functionality.
.SS "Try to avoid IO::Scalar"
.IX Subsection "Try to avoid IO::Scalar"
One of the most common ways to use Archive::Zip is to generate Zip files
in-memory. Most people use IO::Scalar for this purpose.
.PP
Unfortunately, as of 1.11 this module no longer works with IO::Scalar
as it incorrectly implements seeking.
.PP
Anybody using IO::Scalar should consider porting to IO::String,
which is smaller, lighter, and is implemented to be perfectly compatible
with regular seekable filehandles.
.PP
Support for IO::Scalar most likely will \fBnot\fR be restored in the
future, as IO::Scalar itself cannot change the way it is implemented
due to back-compatibility issues.
.SS "Wrong password for encrypted members"
.IX Subsection "Wrong password for encrypted members"
When an encrypted member is read using the wrong password, you currently
have to re-read the entire archive to try again with the correct password.

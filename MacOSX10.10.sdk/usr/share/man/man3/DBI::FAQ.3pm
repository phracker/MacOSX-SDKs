To quote Tim Bunce, the architect and author of \s-1DBI:\s0
.PP
.Vb 4
\&      DBI is a database access Application Programming Interface (API)
\&      for the Perl Language. The DBI API Specification defines a set
\&      of functions, variables and conventions that provide a consistent
\&      database interface independent of the actual database being used.
.Ve
.PP
In simple language, the \s-1DBI\s0 interface allows users to access multiple database
types transparently. So, if you connecting to an Oracle, Informix, mSQL, Sybase
or whatever database, you don't need to know the underlying mechanics of the
3GL layer. The \s-1API\s0 defined by \s-1DBI\s0 will work on \fIall\fR these database types.
.PP
A similar benefit is gained by the ability to connect to two \fIdifferent\fR
databases of different vendor within the one perl script, \fIie\fR, I want
to read data from an Oracle database and insert it back into an Informix
database all within one program. The \s-1DBI\s0 layer allows you to do this simply
and powerfully.
.PP
\&\fIDBperl\fR is the old name for the interface specification. It's usually
now used to denote perl\fI4\fR modules on database interfacing, such as,
\&\fIoraperl\fR, \fIisqlperl\fR, \fIingperl\fR and so on. These interfaces
didn't have a standard \s-1API\s0 and are generally \fInot\fR supported.
.PP
Here's a list of DBperl modules, their corresponding \s-1DBI\s0 counterparts and
support information. \fIPlease note\fR, the author's listed here generally
\&\fIdo not\fR maintain the \s-1DBI\s0 module for the same database. These email
addresses are unverified and should only be used for queries concerning the
perl4 modules listed below. \s-1DBI\s0 driver queries should be directed to the

However, some \s-1DBI\s0 modules have DBperl emulation layers, so, \fIDBD::Oracle\fR
comes with an Oraperl emulation layer, which allows you to run legacy oraperl
scripts without modification. The emulation layer translates the oraperl \s-1API\s0
calls into \s-1DBI\s0 calls and executes them through the \s-1DBI\s0 switch.

In terms of architecture \- not much: Both define programming

.PP
In terms of ease of use \- much: The \s-1DBI\s0 is a 'high level' interface
that, like Perl itself, strives to make the simple things easy while
still making the hard things possible. The \s-1ODBC\s0 is a 'low level'
interface. All nuts-bolts-knobs-and-dials.

Now there's an \s-1ODBC\s0 driver for the \s-1DBI \s0(\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0) the \*(L"What's the

.SS "3.2 What's the difference between Win32::ODBC and \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0?"
.IX Subsection "3.2 What's the difference between Win32::ODBC and DBD::ODBC?"
The \s-1DBI,\s0 and thus \s-1DBD::ODBC,\s0 has a different philosophy from the
Win32::ODBC module:
.PP
The Win32::ODBC module is a 'thin' layer over the low-level \s-1ODBC API.\s0
The \s-1DBI\s0 defines a simpler 'higher level' interface.
.PP
The Win32::ODBC module gives you access to more of the \s-1ODBC API.\s0
The \s-1DBI\s0 and \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 give you access to only the essentials.
(But, unlike Win32::ODBC, the \s-1DBI\s0 and \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 do support parameter
binding and multiple prepared statements which reduces the load on
the database server and can dramatically increase performance.)
.PP
The Win32::ODBC module only works on Win32 systems.
The \s-1DBI\s0 and \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 are very portable and work on Win32 and Unix.
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 and \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 modules are supplied as a standard part of the
Perl 5.004 binary distribution for Win32 (they don't work with the
older, non-standard, ActiveState port).
.PP
Scripts written with the \s-1DBI\s0 and \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 are faster than Win32::ODBC
on Win32 and are trivially portable to other supported database types.
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 offers optional automatic printing or \fIdie()\fRing on errors which
makes applications simpler and more robust.
.PP
The current \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 driver version 0.16 is new and not yet fully stable.
A new release is due soon [relative to the date of the next \s-1TPJ\s0 issue :\-]
and will be much improved and offer more \s-1ODBC\s0 functionality.
.PP
To summarise: The Win32::ODBC module is your best choice if you need
access to more of the \s-1ODBC API\s0 than the \s-1DBI\s0 gives you. Otherwise, the
\&\s-1DBI\s0 and \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 combination may be your best bet.

To sum up, \s-1DBM\s0 is a perfectly satisfactory solution for essentially read-only

From the current author's point of view, if the dataset is relatively

The \f(CW\*(C`httpd\*(C'\fR process usually runs under the user id of \f(CW\*(C`nobody\*(C'\fR,

Perl version 5.005 and later can be built to support multi-threading.
The \s-1DBI,\s0 as of version 1.02, does not yet support multi-threading
so it would be unsafe to let more than one thread enter the \s-1DBI\s0 at
the same time.

It is expected that some future version of the \s-1DBI\s0 will at least be

.SS "5.2 How do I handle \s-1BLOB\s0 data with \s-1DBI\s0?"
.IX Subsection "5.2 How do I handle BLOB data with DBI?"
Handling \s-1BLOB\s0 data with the \s-1DBI\s0 is very straight-forward. \s-1BLOB\s0 columns are
specified in a \s-1SELECT\s0 statement as per normal columns. However, you also
need to specify a maximum \s-1BLOB\s0 size that the <I>database handle</I> can
fetch using the \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR attribute.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    ### $dbh is a connected database handle
\&    $sth = $dbh\->prepare( "SELECT blob_column FROM blobby_table" );
\&    $sth\->execute;
.Ve
.PP
would fail.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    ### $dbh is a connected database handle
\&    ### Set the maximum BLOB size...
\&    $dbh\->{LongReadLen} = 16384;        ### 16Kb...Not much of a BLOB!
\&
\&    $sth = $dbh\->prepare( "..." );
.Ve
.PP
would succeed <I>provided no column values were larger than the specified
value</I>.
.PP
If the \s-1BLOB\s0 data is longer than the value of \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR, then an
error will occur. However, the \s-1DBI\s0 provides an additional piece of
functionality that will automatically truncate the fetched \s-1BLOB\s0 to the
size of \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR if it is longer. This does not cause an error to
occur, but may make your fetched \s-1BLOB\s0 data useless.
.PP
This behaviour is regulated by the \f(CW\*(C`LongTruncOk\*(C'\fR attribute which is
set to a false value by default ( thus making overlong \s-1BLOB\s0 fetches fail ).
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    ### Set BLOB handling such that it\*(Aqs 16Kb and can be truncated
\&    $dbh\->{LongReadLen} = 16384;
\&    $dbh\->{LongTruncOk} = 1;
.Ve
.PP
Truncation of \s-1BLOB\s0 data may not be a big deal in cases where the \s-1BLOB\s0
contains run-length encoded data, but data containing checksums at the end,
for example, a \s-1ZIP\s0 file, would be rendered useless.
.SS "5.3 How can I invoke stored procedures with \s-1DBI\s0?"
.IX Subsection "5.3 How can I invoke stored procedures with DBI?"
The \s-1DBI\s0 does not define a database-independent way of calling stored procedures.
.PP
However, most database that support them also provide a way to call
them from \s-1SQL\s0 statements \- and the \s-1DBI\s0 certainly supports that.
.PP
So, assuming that you have created a stored procedure within the target
database, \fIeg\fR, an Oracle database, you can use \f(CW$dbh\fR\->\f(CW\*(C`do()\*(C'\fR to
immediately execute the procedure. For example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $dbh\->do( "BEGIN someProcedure; END;" );   # Oracle\-specific
.Ve

You should also be able to \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR, which is
the recommended way if you'll be calling the procedure often.

\&\s-1DBI\s0 has no knowledge of understanding of what dates are. Therefore, \s-1DBI\s0
itself does not have a Year 2000 problem. Individual drivers may use date
handling code internally and therefore be potentially susceptible to the
Year 2000 problem, but this is unlikely.

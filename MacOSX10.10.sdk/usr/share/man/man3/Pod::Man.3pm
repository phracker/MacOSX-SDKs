.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Pod::Man is a module to convert documentation in the \s-1POD\s0 format (the
preferred language for documenting Perl) into *roff input using the man
macro set.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a terminal
using \fInroff\fR\|(1), normally via \fIman\fR\|(1), or printing using \fItroff\fR\|(1).
It is conventionally invoked using the driver script \fBpod2man\fR, but it can
also be used directly.
.PP
As a derived class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Man supports the same methods and
interfaces.  See Pod::Simple for all the details.
.PP
\&\fInew()\fR can take options, in the form of key/value pairs that control the
behavior of the parser.  See below for details.
.PP
If no options are given, Pod::Man uses the name of the input file with any
trailing \f(CW\*(C`.pod\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`.pl\*(C'\fR stripped as the man page title, to
section 1 unless the file ended in \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR in which case it defaults to
section 3, to a centered title of \*(L"User Contributed Perl Documentation\*(R", to
a centered footer of the Perl version it is run with, and to a left-hand
footer of the modification date of its input (or the current date if given
\&\f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR for input).
.PP
Pod::Man assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font named
\&\f(CW\*(C`CW\*(C'\fR.  If yours is called something else (like \f(CW\*(C`CR\*(C'\fR), use the \f(CW\*(C`fixed\*(C'\fR
option to specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output for
printing.  Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and
bold italic fixed-width output.
.PP
Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man also takes care of
formatting \fIfunc()\fR, \fIfunc\fR\|(3), and simple variable references like \f(CW$foo\fR or
\&\f(CW@bar\fR so you don't have to use code escapes for them; complex expressions
like \f(CW$fred{\*(Aqstuff\*(Aq}\fR will still need to be escaped, though.  It also
translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes, makes long
dashes\*(--like this\*(--into proper em dashes, fixes \*(L"paired quotes,\*(R" makes \*(C+
look right, puts a little space between double underscores, makes \s-1ALLCAPS\s0
a teeny bit smaller in \fBtroff\fR, and escapes stuff that *roff treats as
special so that you don't have to.
.PP
The recognized options to \fInew()\fR are as follows.  All options take a single
argument.
.IP "center" 4
.IX Item "center"
Sets the centered page header to use instead of \*(L"User Contributed Perl
Documentation\*(R".
.IP "errors" 4
.IX Item "errors"
How to report errors.  \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR says to throw an exception on any \s-1POD\s0
formatting error.  \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR says to report errors on standard error, but
not to throw an exception.  \f(CW\*(C`pod\*(C'\fR says to include a \s-1POD ERRORS\s0 section
in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.  \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR ignores
\&\s-1POD\s0 errors entirely, as much as possible.
.Sp
The default is \f(CW\*(C`output\*(C'\fR.
.IP "date" 4
.IX Item "date"
Sets the left-hand footer.  By default, the modification date of the input
file will be used, or the current date if \fIstat()\fR can't find that file (the
case if the input is from \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR), and the date will be formatted as
\&\f(CW\*(C`YYYY\-MM\-DD\*(C'\fR.
.IP "fixed" 4
.IX Item "fixed"
The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults to
\&\f(CW\*(C`CW\*(C'\fR.  Some systems may want \f(CW\*(C`CR\*(C'\fR instead.  Only matters for \fBtroff\fR
output.
.IP "fixedbold" 4
.IX Item "fixedbold"
Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CB\*(C'\fR.  Only matters
for \fBtroff\fR output.
.IP "fixeditalic" 4
.IX Item "fixeditalic"
Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer,
since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version, not an italic
version).  Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CI\*(C'\fR.  Only matters for \fBtroff\fR output.
.IP "fixedbolditalic" 4
.IX Item "fixedbolditalic"
Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width font.
Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to \f(CW\*(C`CB\*(C'\fR.  Some
systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as \f(CW\*(C`CX\*(C'\fR.  Only matters
for \fBtroff\fR output.
.IP "name" 4
.IX Item "name"
Set the name of the manual page.  Without this option, the manual name is
set to the uppercased base name of the file being converted unless the
manual section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to see if it is a Perl
module path.  If it is, a path like \f(CW\*(C`.../lib/Pod/Man.pm\*(C'\fR is converted into
a name like \f(CW\*(C`Pod::Man\*(C'\fR.  This option, if given, overrides any automatic
determination of the name.
.IP "nourls" 4
.IX Item "nourls"
Normally, L<> formatting codes with a \s-1URL\s0 but anchor text are formatted
to show both the anchor text and the \s-1URL. \s0 In other words:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    L<foo|http://example.com/>
.Ve
.Sp
is formatted as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    foo <http://example.com/>
.Ve
.Sp
This option, if set to a true value, suppresses the \s-1URL\s0 when anchor text
is given, so this example would be formatted as just \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR.  This can
produce less cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly
important.
.IP "quotes" 4
.IX Item "quotes"
Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text.  If the value is a
single character, it is used as both the left and right quote; if it is two
characters, the first character is used as the left quote and the second as
the right quoted; and if it is four characters, the first two are used as
the left quote and the second two as the right quote.
.Sp
This may also be set to the special value \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, in which case no quote
marks are added around C<> text (but the font is still changed for troff
output).
.IP "release" 4
.IX Item "release"
Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl you run
Pod::Man under.  Note that some system an macro sets assume that the
centered footer will be a modification date and will prepend something like
\&\*(L"Last modified: \*(R"; if this is the case, you may want to set \f(CW\*(C`release\*(C'\fR to
the last modified date and \f(CW\*(C`date\*(C'\fR to the version number.
.IP "section" 4
.IX Item "section"
Set the section for the \f(CW\*(C`.TH\*(C'\fR macro.  The standard section numbering
convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for
functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There is a lot
of variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file
formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices.  Still others
use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers
that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.
.Sp
By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in \f(CW\*(C`.pm\*(C'\fR in which
case section 3 will be selected.
.IP "stderr" 4
.IX Item "stderr"
Send error messages about invalid \s-1POD\s0 to standard error instead of
appending a \s-1POD ERRORS\s0 section to the generated *roff output.  This is
equivalent to setting \f(CW\*(C`errors\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`errors\*(C'\fR is not already
set.  It is supported for backward compatibility.
.IP "utf8" 4
.IX Item "utf8"
By default, Pod::Man produces the most conservative possible *roff output
to try to ensure that it will work with as many different *roff
implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations cannot handle
non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters are converted
either to a *roff escape sequence that tries to create a properly accented
character (at least for troff output) or to \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If this option is set, Pod::Man will instead output \s-1UTF\-8. \s0 If your *roff
implementation can handle it, this is the best output format to use and
avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII characters.  However,
be warned that *roff source with literal \s-1UTF\-8\s0 characters is not supported
by many implementations and may even result in segfaults and other bad
behavior.
.Sp
Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your \s-1POD\s0
source must be properly declared unless it is US-ASCII or Latin\-1.  \s-1POD\s0
input without an \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command will be assumed to be in Latin\-1,
and if it's actually in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 the output will be double-encoded.  See
\&\fIperlpod\fR\|(1) for more information on the \f(CW\*(C`=encoding\*(C'\fR command.
.PP
The standard Pod::Simple method \fIparse_file()\fR takes one argument naming the
\&\s-1POD\s0 file to read from.  By default, the output is sent to \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR, but
this can be changed with the \fIoutput_fd()\fR method.
.PP
The standard Pod::Simple method \fIparse_from_file()\fR takes up to two
arguments, the first being the input file to read \s-1POD\s0 from and the second
being the file to write the formatted output to.
.PP
You can also call \fIparse_lines()\fR to parse an array of lines or
\&\fIparse_string_document()\fR to parse a document already in memory.  To put the
output into a string instead of a file handle, call the \fIoutput_string()\fR
method.  See Pod::Simple for the specific details.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"

(F) You specified a *roff font (using \f(CW\*(C`fixed\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`fixedbold\*(C'\fR, etc.) that
wasn't either one or two characters.  Pod::Man doesn't support *roff fonts
longer than two characters, although some *roff extensions do (the
canonical versions of \fBnroff\fR and \fBtroff\fR don't either).
.ie n .IP "Invalid errors setting ""%s""" 4

.IX Item "Invalid quote specification %s"
(F) The quote specification given (the \f(CW\*(C`quotes\*(C'\fR option to the
constructor) was invalid.  A quote specification must be one, two, or four
characters long.
.IP "\s-1POD\s0 document had syntax errors" 4
.IX Item "POD document had syntax errors"
(F) The \s-1POD\s0 document being formatted had syntax errors and the \f(CW\*(C`errors\*(C'\fR
option was set to \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Encoding handling assumes that PerlIO is available and does not work
properly if it isn't.  The \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR option is therefore not supported
unless Perl is built with PerlIO support.
.PP
There is currently no way to turn off the guesswork that tries to format
unmarked text appropriately, and sometimes it isn't wanted (particularly
when using \s-1POD\s0 to document something other than Perl).  Most of the work
toward fixing this has now been done, however, and all that's still needed
is a user interface.
.PP
The \s-1NAME\s0 section should be recognized specially and index entries emitted
for everything in that section.  This would have to be deferred until the
next section, since extraneous things in \s-1NAME\s0 tends to confuse various man
page processors.  Currently, no index entries are emitted for anything in
\&\s-1NAME.\s0
.PP
Pod::Man doesn't handle font names longer than two characters.  Neither do
most \fBtroff\fR implementations, but \s-1GNU\s0 troff does as an extension.  It would
be nice to support as an option for those who want to use it.
.PP
The preamble added to each output file is rather verbose, and most of it
is only necessary in the presence of non-ASCII characters.  It would
ideally be nice if all of those definitions were only output if needed,
perhaps on the fly as the characters are used.
.PP
Pod::Man is excessively slow.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
If Pod::Man is given the \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR option, the encoding of its output file
handle will be forced to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 if possible, overriding any existing
encoding.  This will be done even if the file handle is not created by
Pod::Man and was passed in from outside.  This maintains consistency
regardless of \s-1PERL_UNICODE\s0 and other settings.
.PP
The handling of hyphens and em dashes is somewhat fragile, and one may get
the wrong one under some circumstances.  This should only matter for
\&\fBtroff\fR output.
.PP
When and whether to use small caps is somewhat tricky, and Pod::Man doesn't
necessarily get it right.
.PP
Converting neutral double quotes to properly matched double quotes doesn't
work unless there are no formatting codes between the quote marks.  This
only matters for troff output.

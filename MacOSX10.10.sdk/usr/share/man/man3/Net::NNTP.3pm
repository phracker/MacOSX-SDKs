.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Net::NNTP\*(C'\fR is a class implementing a simple \s-1NNTP\s0 client in Perl as described
in \s-1RFC977. \s0\f(CW\*(C`Net::NNTP\*(C'\fR inherits its communication methods from \f(CW\*(C`Net::Cmd\*(C'\fR
.SH "CONSTRUCTOR"
.IX Header "CONSTRUCTOR"
.IP "new ( [ \s-1HOST \s0] [, \s-1OPTIONS \s0])" 4
.IX Item "new ( [ HOST ] [, OPTIONS ])"
This is the constructor for a new Net::NNTP object. \f(CW\*(C`HOST\*(C'\fR is the
name of the remote host to which a \s-1NNTP\s0 connection is required. If not
given then it may be passed as the \f(CW\*(C`Host\*(C'\fR option described below. If no host is passed
then two environment variables are checked, first \f(CW\*(C`NNTPSERVER\*(C'\fR then
\&\f(CW\*(C`NEWSHOST\*(C'\fR, then \f(CW\*(C`Net::Config\*(C'\fR is checked, and if a host is not found
then \f(CW\*(C`news\*(C'\fR is used.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`OPTIONS\*(C'\fR are passed in a hash like fashion, using key and value pairs.
Possible options are:
.Sp
\&\fBHost\fR \- \s-1NNTP\s0 host to connect to. It may be a single scalar, as defined for
the \f(CW\*(C`PeerAddr\*(C'\fR option in IO::Socket::INET, or a reference to
an array with hosts to try in turn. The \*(L"host\*(R" method will return the value
which was used to connect to the host.
.Sp
\&\fBTimeout\fR \- Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the
\&\s-1NNTP\s0 server, a value of zero will cause all \s-1IO\s0 operations to block.
(default: 120)
.Sp
\&\fBDebug\fR \- Enable the printing of debugging information to \s-1STDERR\s0
.Sp
\&\fBReader\fR \- If the remote server is \s-1INN\s0 then initially the connection
will be to nnrpd, by default \f(CW\*(C`Net::NNTP\*(C'\fR will issue a \f(CW\*(C`MODE READER\*(C'\fR command
so that the remote server becomes innd. If the \f(CW\*(C`Reader\*(C'\fR option is given
with a value of zero, then this command will not be sent and the
connection will be left talking to nnrpd.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
Unless otherwise stated all methods return either a \fItrue\fR or \fIfalse\fR
value, with \fItrue\fR meaning that the operation was a success. When a method
states that it returns a value, failure will be returned as \fIundef\fR or an
empty list.
.IP "article ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [\s-1FH\s0] )" 4
.IX Item "article ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [FH] )"
Retrieve the header, a blank line, then the body (text) of the
specified article.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`FH\*(C'\fR is specified then it is expected to be a valid filehandle
and the result will be printed to it, on success a true value will be
returned. If \f(CW\*(C`FH\*(C'\fR is not specified then the return value, on success,
will be a reference to an array containing the article requested, each
entry in the array will contain one line of the article.
.Sp
If no arguments are passed then the current article in the currently
selected newsgroup is fetched.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`MSGNUM\*(C'\fR is a numeric id of an article in the current newsgroup, and
will change the current article pointer.  \f(CW\*(C`MSGID\*(C'\fR is the message id of
an article as shown in that article's header.  It is anticipated that the
client will obtain the \f(CW\*(C`MSGID\*(C'\fR from a list provided by the \f(CW\*(C`newnews\*(C'\fR
command, from references contained within another article, or from the
message-id provided in the response to some other commands.
.Sp
If there is an error then \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR will be returned.
.IP "body ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [\s-1FH\s0] )" 4
.IX Item "body ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [FH] )"
Like \f(CW\*(C`article\*(C'\fR but only fetches the body of the article.
.IP "head ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [\s-1FH\s0] )" 4
.IX Item "head ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [FH] )"
Like \f(CW\*(C`article\*(C'\fR but only fetches the headers for the article.
.IP "articlefh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )" 4
.IX Item "articlefh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )"
.PD 0
.IP "bodyfh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )" 4
.IX Item "bodyfh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )"
.IP "headfh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )" 4
.IX Item "headfh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )"
.PD
These are similar to \fIarticle()\fR, \fIbody()\fR and \fIhead()\fR, but rather than
returning the requested data directly, they return a tied filehandle
from which to read the article.
.IP "nntpstat ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )" 4
.IX Item "nntpstat ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )"
The \f(CW\*(C`nntpstat\*(C'\fR command is similar to the \f(CW\*(C`article\*(C'\fR command except that no
text is returned.  When selecting by message number within a group,
the \f(CW\*(C`nntpstat\*(C'\fR command serves to set the \*(L"current article pointer\*(R" without
sending text.
.Sp
Using the \f(CW\*(C`nntpstat\*(C'\fR command to
select by message-id is valid but of questionable value, since a
selection by message-id does \fBnot\fR alter the \*(L"current article pointer\*(R".
.Sp
Returns the message-id of the \*(L"current article\*(R".
.IP "group ( [ \s-1GROUP \s0] )" 4
.IX Item "group ( [ GROUP ] )"
Set and/or get the current group. If \f(CW\*(C`GROUP\*(C'\fR is not given then information
is returned on the current group.
.Sp
In a scalar context it returns the group name.
.Sp
In an array context the return value is a list containing, the number
of articles in the group, the number of the first article, the number
of the last article and the group name.
.IP "ihave ( \s-1MSGID\s0 [, \s-1MESSAGE \s0])" 4
.IX Item "ihave ( MSGID [, MESSAGE ])"
The \f(CW\*(C`ihave\*(C'\fR command informs the server that the client has an article
whose id is \f(CW\*(C`MSGID\*(C'\fR.  If the server desires a copy of that
article, and \f(CW\*(C`MESSAGE\*(C'\fR has been given the it will be sent.
.Sp
Returns \fItrue\fR if the server desires the article and \f(CW\*(C`MESSAGE\*(C'\fR was
successfully sent,if specified.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`MESSAGE\*(C'\fR is not specified then the message must be sent using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`datasend\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`dataend\*(C'\fR methods from Net::Cmd
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`MESSAGE\*(C'\fR can be either an array of lines or a reference to an array.
.IP "last ()" 4
.IX Item "last ()"
Set the \*(L"current article pointer\*(R" to the previous article in the current
newsgroup.
.Sp
Returns the message-id of the article.
.IP "date ()" 4
.IX Item "date ()"
Returns the date on the remote server. This date will be in a \s-1UNIX\s0 time
format (seconds since 1970)
.IP "postok ()" 4
.IX Item "postok ()"
\&\f(CW\*(C`postok\*(C'\fR will return \fItrue\fR if the servers initial response indicated
that it will allow posting.
.IP "authinfo ( \s-1USER, PASS \s0)" 4
.IX Item "authinfo ( USER, PASS )"
Authenticates to the server (using \s-1AUTHINFO USER / AUTHINFO PASS\s0)
using the supplied username and password.  Please note that the
password is sent in clear text to the server.  This command should not
be used with valuable passwords unless the connection to the server is
somehow protected.
.IP "list ()" 4
.IX Item "list ()"
Obtain information about all the active newsgroups. The results is a reference
to a hash where the key is a group name and each value is a reference to an
array. The elements in this array are:\- the last article number in the group,
the first article number in the group and any information flags about the group.
.IP "newgroups ( \s-1SINCE\s0 [, \s-1DISTRIBUTIONS \s0])" 4
.IX Item "newgroups ( SINCE [, DISTRIBUTIONS ])"
\&\f(CW\*(C`SINCE\*(C'\fR is a time value and \f(CW\*(C`DISTRIBUTIONS\*(C'\fR is either a distribution
pattern or a reference to a list of distribution patterns.
The result is the same as \f(CW\*(C`list\*(C'\fR, but the
groups return will be limited to those created after \f(CW\*(C`SINCE\*(C'\fR and, if
specified, in one of the distribution areas in \f(CW\*(C`DISTRIBUTIONS\*(C'\fR.
.IP "newnews ( \s-1SINCE\s0 [, \s-1GROUPS\s0 [, \s-1DISTRIBUTIONS \s0]])" 4
.IX Item "newnews ( SINCE [, GROUPS [, DISTRIBUTIONS ]])"
\&\f(CW\*(C`SINCE\*(C'\fR is a time value. \f(CW\*(C`GROUPS\*(C'\fR is either a group pattern or a reference
to a list of group patterns. \f(CW\*(C`DISTRIBUTIONS\*(C'\fR is either a distribution
pattern or a reference to a list of distribution patterns.
.Sp
Returns a reference to a list which contains the message-ids of all news posted
after \f(CW\*(C`SINCE\*(C'\fR, that are in a groups which matched \f(CW\*(C`GROUPS\*(C'\fR and a
distribution which matches \f(CW\*(C`DISTRIBUTIONS\*(C'\fR.
.IP "next ()" 4
.IX Item "next ()"
Set the \*(L"current article pointer\*(R" to the next article in the current
newsgroup.
.Sp
Returns the message-id of the article.
.IP "post ( [ \s-1MESSAGE \s0] )" 4
.IX Item "post ( [ MESSAGE ] )"
Post a new article to the news server. If \f(CW\*(C`MESSAGE\*(C'\fR is specified and posting
is allowed then the message will be sent.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`MESSAGE\*(C'\fR is not specified then the message must be sent using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`datasend\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`dataend\*(C'\fR methods from Net::Cmd
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`MESSAGE\*(C'\fR can be either an array of lines or a reference to an array.
.Sp
The message, either sent via \f(CW\*(C`datasend\*(C'\fR or as the \f(CW\*(C`MESSAGE\*(C'\fR
parameter, must be in the format as described by \s-1RFC822\s0 and must
contain From:, Newsgroups: and Subject: headers.
.IP "postfh ()" 4
.IX Item "postfh ()"
Post a new article to the news server using a tied filehandle.  If
posting is allowed, this method will return a tied filehandle that you
can \fIprint()\fR the contents of the article to be posted.  You must
explicitly \fIclose()\fR the filehandle when you are finished posting the
article, and the return value from the \fIclose()\fR call will indicate
whether the message was successfully posted.

.IX Item "slave ()"
Tell the remote server that I am not a user client, but probably another
news server.
.IP "quit ()" 4
.IX Item "quit ()"
Quit the remote server and close the socket connection.
.SS "Extension methods"
.IX Subsection "Extension methods"
These methods use commands that are not part of the \s-1RFC977\s0 documentation. Some
servers may not support all of them.
.IP "newsgroups ( [ \s-1PATTERN \s0] )" 4
.IX Item "newsgroups ( [ PATTERN ] )"
Returns a reference to a hash where the keys are all the group names which
match \f(CW\*(C`PATTERN\*(C'\fR, or all of the groups if no pattern is specified, and
each value contains the description text for the group.
.IP "distributions ()" 4
.IX Item "distributions ()"
Returns a reference to a hash where the keys are all the possible
distribution names and the values are the distribution descriptions.
.IP "subscriptions ()" 4

The return value will be a reference
to a hash where the keys are the message numbers and each value contains
the text of the requested header for that message.
.IP "xover ( MESSAGE-SPEC )" 4
.IX Item "xover ( MESSAGE-SPEC )"
The return value will be a reference
to a hash where the keys are the message numbers and each value contains
a reference to an array which contains the overview fields for that
message.
.Sp
The names of the fields can be obtained by calling \f(CW\*(C`overview_fmt\*(C'\fR.
.IP "xpath ( MESSAGE-ID )" 4

.IP "reader" 4
.IX Item "reader"
Tell the server that you are a reader and not another server.
.Sp
This is required by some servers. For example if you are connecting to
an \s-1INN\s0 server and you have transfer permission your connection will
be connected to the transfer daemon, not the \s-1NNTP\s0 daemon. Issuing
this command will cause the transfer daemon to hand over control
to the \s-1NNTP\s0 daemon.
.Sp
Some servers do not understand this command, but issuing it and ignoring
the response is harmless.

.IP "\s-1PATTERN\s0" 4
.IX Item "PATTERN"
The \f(CW\*(C`NNTP\*(C'\fR protocol uses the \f(CW\*(C`WILDMAT\*(C'\fR format for patterns.
The \s-1WILDMAT\s0 format was first developed by Rich Salz based on
the format used in the \s-1UNIX \s0\*(L"find\*(R" command to articulate
file names. It was developed to provide a uniform mechanism
for matching patterns in the same manner that the \s-1UNIX\s0 shell
matches filenames.
.Sp
Patterns are implicitly anchored at the
beginning and end of each string when testing for a match.
.Sp
There are five pattern matching operations other than a strict
one-to-one match between the pattern and the source to be
checked for a match.
.Sp
The first is an asterisk \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR to match any sequence of zero or more
characters.
.Sp
The second is a question mark \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR to match any single character. The
third specifies a specific set of characters.
.Sp
The set is specified as a list of characters, or as a range of characters
where the beginning and end of the range are separated by a minus (or dash)
character, or as any combination of lists and ranges. The dash can
also be included in the set as a character it if is the beginning
or end of the set. This set is enclosed in square brackets. The
close square bracket \f(CW\*(C`]\*(C'\fR may be used in a set if it is the first
character in the set.
.Sp
The fourth operation is the same as the
logical not of the third operation and is specified the same
way as the third with the addition of a caret character \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR at
the beginning of the test string just inside the open square
bracket.
.Sp
The final operation uses the backslash character to
invalidate the special meaning of an open square bracket \f(CW\*(C`[\*(C'\fR,
the asterisk, backslash or the question mark. Two backslashes in
sequence will result in the evaluation of the backslash as a
character with no special meaning.

// A transition context object is constructed by the system and passed to the
// animator in its animateTransition: and transitionDuration: methods as well as
// to the interaction controller in its startInteractiveTransition: method. If
// there is an interaction controller its startInteractiveTransition: is called
// first and its up to the the interaction controller object to call the
// animateTransition: method if needed. If there is no interaction controller,
// then the system automatically invokes the animator's animateTransition:
// method.
//
// The system queries the view controller's transitioningDelegate or the
// navigation controller's delegate to determine if an animator or interaction
// controller should be used in a transition. The transitioningDelegate is a new
// property on UIViewController and conforms to the
// UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate protocol defined below. The navigation
// controller likewise has been augmented with a couple of new delegate methods.
//
// The UIViewControllerContextTransitioning protocol can be adopted by custom
// container controllers.  It is purposely general to cover more complex
// transitions than the system currently supports. For now, navigation push/pops
// and UIViewController present/dismiss transitions can be
// customized. Information about the transition is obtained by using the
// viewControllerForKey:, initialFrameForViewController:, and
// finalFrameForViewController: methods. The system provides two keys for
// identifying the from view controller and the to view controller for
// navigation push/pop and view controller present/dismiss transitions.
//
// All custom animations must invoke the context's completeTransition: method
// when the transition completes.  Furthermore the animation should take place
// within the containerView specified by the context. For interactive
// transitions the context's updateInteractiveTransition:,
// finishInteractiveTransition or cancelInteractiveTransition should be called
// as the interactive animation proceeds. The UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition
// class provides an implementation of the UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning
// protocol that can be used to interactively drive any UIView property animations
// that are created by an animator.

/*!
 @class SFAuthenticationSession
 An SFAuthenticationSession object can be used to authenticate a user with a web service, even if the web service is run by a third party.
 SFAuthenticationSession puts the user in control of whether they want to use their existing logged-in session from Safari. The
 app provides a URL that points to the authentication webpage. The page will be loaded in a secure view controller. From the
 webpage, the user can authenticate herself and grant access to the app. On completion, the service will send a callback URL with
 an authentication token, and this URL will be passed to the app by SFAuthenticationCompletionHandler.

 The callback URL usually has a custom URL scheme. For the app to receive the callback URL, it needs to either register the
 custom URL scheme in its Info.plist, or set the scheme to callbackURLScheme argument in the initializer.

 If the user has already logged into the web service in Safari or other apps via SFAuthenticationSession, it is possible to
 share the existing login information. An alert will be presented to get the user's consent for sharing their existing login
 information. If the user cancels the alert, the session will be canceled, and the completion handler will be called with
 the error code SFAuthenticationErrorCanceledLogin.

 If the user taps Cancel when showing the login webpage for the web service, the session will be canceled, and the completion handler
 will be called with the error code SFAuthenticationErrorCanceledLogin.

 The app can cancel the session by calling -[SFAuthenticationSession cancel]. This will also dismiss the view controller that
 is showing the web service's login page.

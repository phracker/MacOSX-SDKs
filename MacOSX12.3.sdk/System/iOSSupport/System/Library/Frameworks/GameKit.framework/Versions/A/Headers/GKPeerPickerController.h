/* The GKPeerPickerController class manages the system-supplied user interface for choosing peers to connect with for multiplayer games. The class manages the actual user interactions with the views and reports the results of those interactions to your delegate object.
 
 Because the GKPeerPickerController class handles all of the user interactions, all you have to do is tell it which GKSession selected peers should be connected to, tell it to start, and then wait to receive a delegate callback when the picker finished connecting peers or cancels.
 
 You must provide a delegate that conforms to the GKPeerPickerControllerDelegate protocol in order to use this class. After the user interface starts, this class notifies your delegate of the userâ€™s actions.

 @class         HKQuantitySeriesSampleBuilder
 @abstract      An HKQuantitySeriesSampleBuilder is used to generate HKQuantitySample(s) with multiple
                quantities.
 @discussion    An HKQuantitySeriesSampleBuilder is used to incrementally create a new quantity series
                sample in the HealthKit database. This class may be used to create long-running quantity
                series samples that are associated with an activity like a workout. After inserting each
                of the quantities that make up the series, the series may be finalized by calling
                -finishSeriesWithMetadata:completion:. Calling -discard invalidates the series and
                discards any data that was previously associated with it.

 @class              HKHeartbeatSeriesBuilder
 @abstract           An HKHeartbeatSeriesBuilder is used to generate an HKHeartbeatSeriesSample.
 @discussion         This class is intended for generating an HKHeartbeatSeriesSample which represents a series of
                     heartbeats. If the discard method is called, collected data will be deleted.
                     Calling finishSeriesWithcompletion: will stop and complete the series. If the builder is deleted,
                     or the client goes away before calling the finish method, data will be lost.

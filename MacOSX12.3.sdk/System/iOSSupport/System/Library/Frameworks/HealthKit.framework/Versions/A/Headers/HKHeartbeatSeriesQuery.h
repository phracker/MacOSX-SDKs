 @param         heartbeatSeries    The HKHeartbeatSeriesSample for which the heartbeat data will be returned.
 @param         dataHandler        The block to invoke with results from the query. It is called repeatedly for each

                                   series startDate that represents when the heartbeat occured. precededByGap indicates if
                                   there was a gap in data collection before the current heartbeat, meaning that one or more
                                   heartbeats may have occured since the previous heartbeat in the series. Once done is YES,
                                   or stopQuery called, the query is complete and no more calls to the handler will be made.

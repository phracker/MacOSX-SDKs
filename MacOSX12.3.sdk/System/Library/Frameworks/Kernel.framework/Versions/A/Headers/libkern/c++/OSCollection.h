 * @class OSCollection
 *
 * @abstract
 * The abstract superclass for Libkern collections.
 *
 * @discussion
 * OSCollection is the abstract superclass
 * for all Libkern C++ object collections.
 * It defines the necessary interfaces for managing storage space
 * and iterating through an arbitrary collection
 * (see the
 * @link //apple_ref/cpp/class/OSIterator OSIterator@/link
 * and
 * @link //apple_ref/cpp/class/OSCollectionIterator OSCollectionIterator@/link
 * classes).
 * It is up to concrete subclasses
 * to define their specific content management functions.
 *
 * <b>Use Restrictions</b>
 *
 * With very few exceptions in the I/O Kit, all Libkern-based C++
 * classes, functions, and macros are <b>unsafe</b>
 * to use in a primary interrupt context.
 * Consult the I/O Kit documentation related to primary interrupts
 * for more information.
 *
 * OSCollection provides no concurrency protection;
 * it's up to the usage context to provide any protection necessary.
 * Some portions of the I/O Kit, such as
 * @link //apple_ref/doc/class/IORegistryEntry IORegistryEntry@/link,
 * handle synchronization via defined member functions for setting
 * properties.

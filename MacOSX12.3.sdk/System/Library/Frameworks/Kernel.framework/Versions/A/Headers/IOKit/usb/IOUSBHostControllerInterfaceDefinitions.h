 * @brief       Transfer IOUSBHostCIMessage expectations
 * @discussion  Data movement is accomplished via arrays of IOUSBHostCIMessage structures with a IOUSBHostCIMessageControlType of IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeSetupTransfer, IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeNormalTransfer,
 *              IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeStatusTransfer, IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeIsochronousTransfer, and IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeLink.  Control endpoints support IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeSetupTransfer and
 *              IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeStatusTransfer messages, and use IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeNormalTransfer to represent the data phase of transfers.  Isochronous endpoints use
 *              IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeIsochronousTransfer messages.  Bulk and interrupt endpoints use IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeNormalTransfer messages.
 *
 *              The last message in an array has the type IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeLink, which when valid points to the first entry in the next array of messages.  IOUSBHostCIEndpointStateMachine aids in parsing these structures
 *              and following valid links.
 *
 *              When a doorbell message arrives for the endpoint, clients should use the IOUSBHostCIEndpoointStateMachine processDoorbell interface and currentTransferMessage property to check for valid transfer messages to
 *              process.  While parsing transfer messages, those with the IOUSBHostCIMessageControlNoResponse bit cleared should use the IOUSBHostCIEndpointStateMachine enqueueTransferCompletionForMessage
 *              interface to deliver a IOUSBHostCIMessageTypeTransferComplete message to the kernel driver.  If a control, bulk, or interrupt endpoint transfer message is being completed with an unsuccessful status, the endpoint
 *              will transition to the IOUSBHostCIEndpointStateHalted state, and the client must first ensure it has quiesced activity on the endpoint and is no longer accessing transfer structures or data buffers for that endpoint.

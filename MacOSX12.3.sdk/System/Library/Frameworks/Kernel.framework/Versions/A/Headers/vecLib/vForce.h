/*! @header
 *  vForce provides fast mathematical operations on large arrays.
 *
 *  There are several differences between vForce and the similar functions
 *  available in libm. They are:
 *  1) vForce can operate on arrays of any size (libm only works on scalars,
 *     and simd.h on small fixed size vectors).
 *  2) vForce may treat some or all denormal numbers as zero.
 *  3) vForce does not guarantee to set floating point flags correctly.
 *
 *  However, unlike some fast math alternatives, vForce respects the closure of
 *  the number system, therefore infinities and NaNs are correctly processed.
 *
 *  Developers should assume that the exact value returned and treatment of
 *  denormal values will vary across different microarchitectures and versions
 *  of the operating system.
 *
 *  For very small vectors, users may wish to consider using simd.h for
 *  increased performance.

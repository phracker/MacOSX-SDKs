 @abstract Virtio Traditional Memory Balloon Device
 @discussion
    This is a primitive device for managing guest memory.
    This device enables memory transfer between the host and the guest as specified by the Virtio specification, which allows the guest to adapt changes
    in allowance of underlying physical memory.

    To request a memory balloon device operation for the memory transfer, write the targeted memory size for the virtual machine to the targetVirtualMachineMemorySize property.
    When the value written to targetVirtualMachineMemorySize is less than the current value, memory will be taken away from the guest and given to the host by the amount
    determined by the difference between those two values. Similarly, when the value written to targetVirtualMachineMemorySize is greater than the current value, memory will be
    given back to the guest by the amount determined by the difference between those two values.

    Note that any changes to targetVirtualMachineMemorySize is a request to trigger a memory balloon operation. The actual changes in memory only happen after the guest operating
    system handles the request, if at all.

    The targetVirtualMachineMemorySize property is initialized to VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.memorySize. The acceptable values for the targetVirtualMachineMemorySize
    property range from VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.minimumAllowedMemorySize to VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.memorySize, and must be a multiple of 1 megabyte
    (1024 * 1024 bytes). If those constraints aren't satisfied, targetVirtualMachineMemorySize will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 1 megabyte, clamped to
    VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.minimumAllowedMemorySize and VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.memorySize respectively.

    For optimal performance, it is strongly recommended to perform a memory compaction operation in the guest (e.g. echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory) before invoking the device.
    This helps to minimize memory fragmentation in order for the memory allocation/deallocation process to be more effective.

    This device is created through instantiating a VZVirtioTraditionalMemoryBalloonDeviceConfiguration in a VZVirtualMachineConfiguration and is available in the
    VZVirtualMachine.memoryBalloonDevices property.

    The targetVirtualMachineMemorySize must be a multiple of 1 megabyte (1024 * 1024 bytes) between VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.minimumAllowedMemorySize
    and VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.memorySize. If those constraints aren't satisfied, targetVirtualMachineMemorySize will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of
    1 megabyte, clamped to VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.minimumAllowedMemorySize and VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.memorySize respectively.

    The targetVirtualMachineMemorySize represents the amount of physical memory to be made available to the guest.

	@header
	
	To better follow this header, you should understand the following
	terms:
	
	Transform		A transform converts data from one form to another.
					Digests, encryption and decryption are all examples
					of transforms.  Each transform performs a single
					operation.
	Transform
	Group			A transform group is a directed (typically) acyclic 
					graph of transforms. Results from a transform flow 
					to the next Transform in the graph, and so on until 
					the end of the graph is reached. 
	
	Attribute		Transforms may have one or more attributes.  These
					attributes are parameters for the transforms and
					may affect the operation of the transform.  The value
					of an attribute may be set with static data or from
					the value of an attribute in another transform
					by connecting the attributes using the 
					SecTransformConnectTransforms API.
	
	External
	Representation	Transforms may be created programmatically or from
					an external representation.  External representations
					may be created from existing transforms.
	
	There are many types of transforms available.  These are documented
	in their own headers.  The functions in this header are applicable
	to all transforms.

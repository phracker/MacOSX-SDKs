/**
 * A rule system consists of 3 things:
 * - The current state, which upon creation is considered the inital state.
 * - The current set of rules.
 * - The current set of facts.
 * 
 * Each time a fact is added to the system, the set of rules are evaluated in order and their actions executed in the system if their predicates are true.
 * Rules can be fuzzy, allowing predicates and facts to be asserted to a degree of confidence instead of just boolean on/off.
 * 
 * The facts can be any kind of objects as long as they correctly determine equality using isEqual:
 * The simplest approach is to use strings or dictionaries as they provide the most flexibility in defining
 * facts, but user defined classes work just as well and may describe the problem space better.
 *
 * The fact set is at all times a fuzzy set, as defined by fact membership in the set being modulated by their
 * grade of membership. The rules may use the grade of membership to predicate their actions and in such a
 * manner create fuzzy logic. The fuzzy logic Zadeh operators are available on the system itself in order
 * to query multiple facts for combined membership grade.

 *  @class      MPSImageEDLines
 *  @discussion The MPSImageEDLInes class implements the EDLines line segmenting algorithm using edge-drawing (ED)
 *              described here
 *              https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6116138
 *
 *              The EDLInes algorithm consists of 5 steps, the first 4 of which describe the ED algorithm:
 *              1. Blur the source image using a Gaussian blur with a sigma parameter
 *              2. Use horizontal and vertical Sobel filters to find a gradient magnitude and
 *                direction.
 *                  G = sqrt(Sx^2 + Sy^2)
 *                  G_ang = arctan(Sy / Sx)
 *              3. Compute anchor points, points with a high probability of being edge pixels.
 *                Anchor points are local maxima, in the gradient image that lie on row and column
 *                multiples of the detailRatio. This parameter effectively downsamples the gradient
 *                image, and directly influences the density of anchor points. A larger detailRatio results
 *                in fewer fine grained details, leaving long, main lines.
 *              4. Anchor points are traced in a forward and backward direction along the gradient direction, until
 *                the gradient falls below some gradientThreshold parameter or the edge of the image is reached.
 *                The paths traced become an edge map of the image.
 *              5. Points in the edges are fit to a line), and extended along the edge until the line error crosses a
 *                lineErrorThreshold. Lines which are beyond a minimum length are labelled line segments and
 *                will be outputs of the algorithm.

 *  @class          MPSState
 *  @dependency     This depends on Metal Framework
 *  @abstract       A semi-opaque data container for large storage in MPS CNN filters
 *  @discussion     Some MPS CNN kernels produce additional information beyond a
 *                  MPSImage. These may be pooling indices where the result came from,
 *                  convolution weights, or other information not contained in the
 *                  usual MPSImage result from a MPSCNNKernel. A MPSState object 
 *                  typically contains one or more expensive MTLResources such as 
 *                  textures or buffers to store this information.  It provides a 
 *                  base class with interfaces for managing this storage. Child 
 *                  classes may add additional functionality specific to their
 *                  contents.
 *
 *                  Some MPSState objects are temporary. Temporary state objects, 
 *                  like MPSTemporaryImages and Matrices, are for very short lived storage,
 *                  perhaps just a few lines of code within the scope of a single
 *                  MTLCommandBuffer.  They are very efficient for storage, as several
 *                  temporary objects can share the same memory over the course of a 
 *                  MTLCommandBuffer. This can improve both memory usage and time spent
 *                  in the kernel wiring down memory and such. You may find that some 
 *                  large CNN tasks can not be computed without them, as non-temporary
 *                  storage would simply take up too much memory.
 *
 *                  In exchange, the lifetime of the underlying storage in temporary 
 *                  MPSState objects needs to be carefully managed. ARC often waits 
 *                  until the end of scope to release objects. Temporary storage often 
 *                  needs to be released sooner than that. Consequently the lifetime of 
 *                  the data in the underlying MTLResources is managed by a readCount 
 *                  property. Each time a MPSCNNKernel reads a temporary MPSState object
 *                  the readCount is automatically decremented. When it reaches zero, the
 *                  underlying storage is recycled for use by other MPS temporary objects,
 *                  and the data is becomes undefined.  If you need to consume the data
 *                  multiple times, you should set the readCount to a larger number to 
 *                  prevent the data from becomming undefined.  You may set the readCount
 *                  to 0 yourself to return the storage to MPS, if for any reason, you 
 *                  realize that the MPSState object will no longer be used. 
 *
 *                  The contents of a temporary MPSState object are only valid from 
 *                  creation to the time the readCount reaches 0. The data is only valid 
 *                  for the MTLCommandBuffer on which it was created.  Non-temporary
 *                  MPSState objects are valid on any MTLCommandBuffer on the same
 *                  device until they are released.
 *
 *
 *                  Finally, temporary MPSState objects are complicated to use with blit encoders.
 *                  Your application should assume that the temporary MPSState is backed by a MTLHeap,
 *                  and consequently needs a MTLFence to ensure that compute command encoders and other
 *                  encoders do not trip over one another with heap based memory. MPS will almost never
 *                  use a blit encoder for this reason. If you do need one, then you will need to make
 *                  a new compute encoder to block on whatever previous compute encoder last used the
 *                  heap block. (MPS will not tell you who previously used the heap block. That encoder
 *                  is almost certainly long dead anyway.) If concurrent encoders are involved, then a
 *                  barrier might be needed. Within that compute encoder, you will call -updateFence.
 *                  End the compute encoder, make a blit encoder wait for the fence, do the blit, update
 *                  a new fence, then make a new compute encoder, wait for the second fence, then you
 *                  can continue. Possibly the second do-nothing compute encoder needs to be ended so
 *                  MPS can be called. Frankly, we don't bother with blit encoders and just write a compute
 *                  operation for copy / clear as needed, or better yet find a way to eliminate the
 *                  clear / copy pass so we don't have to pay for it. Your application needs to use
 *                  temporary MPSStates and MPSTemporaryImages. Memory costs skyrocket, otherwise.
 *                  It is the blit encoder that is hopefully optional. Note: the most common use of a
 *                  blit encoder, -synchronizeResource: can not encounter this problem because temporary
 *                  images and states live in GPU private memory and can not be read by the CPU.

 *
 *  @discussion     MPSState must release their underlying resources for reuse
 *                  immediately after last use. So as to facilitate *prompt* convenient
 *                  memory recycling, each time a temporary MPSState is read by a
 *                  MPSCNNKernel -encode... method, its readCount is automatically
 *                  decremented. When the readCount reaches 0, the underlying resources are
 *                  automatically made available for reuse by MPS prior to return from 
 *                  the -encode.. method. Any data stored by the MPSState becomes undefined 
 *                  at this time.
 *
 *                  By default, the readCount is initialized to 1, indicating a image that
 *                  may be overwritten any number of times, but read only once. Non-temporary
 *                  MPSState objects have their readCount initialized to 0. Please use the
 *                  isTemporary method to learn whether a MPSState object is temporary.
 *
 *                  You may change the readCount as desired to allow MPSCNNKernels to read
 *                  the state object additional times. However, it is an error to change
 *                  the readCount once it is zero. It is an error to read or write to a
 *                  temporary MPSState object with a zero readCount. You may set the 
 *                  readCount to 0 yourself to cause the underlying storage to be returned
 *                  to MPS.
 *
 *                  The Metal API Validation layer will assert if a temporary MPSState is
 *                  deallocated with non-zero readCount to help identify cases when resources
 *                  are not returned promptly.
 *
 *                  ReadCount behavior for MPSStateBatches:
 *                      In some cases, the same state object is used for the entire batch.
 *                  This is common when the filter needs to accumulate state over an entire
 *                  batch, such as during weight update for convolution or statistics accumulation
 *                  in batch normalization. In such cases, the single MPSState accumulator
 *                  is represented as a MPSStateBatch with batch.count pointers to the same
 *                  MPSState object.  When MPS decrements the read count on states or images
 *                  in a batch it only does so on unique objects. Your application should follow

/*! @abstract Get the private MTLResource underlying the MPSState
 *  @discussion  When the state is not directly initialized with a MTLResource,
 *               the actuall MTLResource creation is deferred. Especially with
 *               temporary resources, it is important to delay this creation
 *               as late as possible to avoid increasing the memory footprint.
 *               The memory is returned for reuse when the readCount = 0. Calling
 *               the -resource method will force the resource to be allocated,
 *               so you should not use it lightly, for purposes such as finding
 *               the MTLPixelFormat of a texture in the state.
 *
 *               By convention, except where otherwise documented, the MTLResources
 *               held by the MPSState are private to the MPSState object, owned
 *               by the MPSState subclass author. If the MPSState subclass
 *               author is MPS, then the identity (e.g. texture vs. buffer)
 *               and information contained in the resource should be considered
 *               implementation dependent. It may change by operating system
 *               version or device. If you are the author of the subclass then it
 *               is for your own use, and MPS will not look at it, except perhaps
 *               so as to pass it to a custom kernel.  Otherwise, the method is made
 *               available to facilitate debugging and to allow you to write your own
 *               state objects.

/*! @abstract raise or lower the readcount of a batch by a set amount
 *  @discussion     In some circumstances, a MPSState may appear in a MPSStateBatch

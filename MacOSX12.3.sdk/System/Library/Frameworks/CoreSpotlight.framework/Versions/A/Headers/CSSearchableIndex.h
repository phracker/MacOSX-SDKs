//Batching:

//For some clients, it may be beneficial to batch updates to the index.  Those clients can use batching and persist client state information (< 250 bytes) in the index.  That state information can be used to determine where indexing needs to resume from in case of a client crash or jetsam. Batching is supported for indexSearchableItems deleteSearchableItemsWithIdentifiers.  Persisted client state will be reset whenever deleteAllSearchableItemsWithCompletionHandler is called.

//Note: Batching is unsupported for the CSSearchableIndex returned by the defaultSearchableIndex method

//Thread safety: In batch mode, the client takes responsibility for protecting the private CSSearchableIndex instance from concurrent access from multiple threads. Concurrent calls to the index instance will have undefined results. beginIndexBatch must not be called again before endIndexBatchWithClientState:completionHandler: has returned (it is however safe to call before the completionHandler passed to endIndexBatchWithClientState:completionHandler has been called).

	@header
	@abstract	API for creating and manipulating CMSampleBuffers.
	@discussion	CMSampleBuffers are CF objects containing zero or more compressed (or uncompressed)
				samples of a particular media type (audio, video, muxed, etc), that are used to move
				media sample data through the media system.
				
				A CMSampleBuffer can contain a CMBlockBuffer of one or more media samples or a CVImageBuffer,
				a reference to the format description for the stream of CMSampleBuffers, size and timing
				information for each of the contained media samples, and both buffer-level and sample-level
				attachments.  The buffer-level attachments of a CMSampleBuffer are distinct from the attachments
				of its contained CMBlockBuffer. An example of a sample-level attachment is an annotation about
				video frame dependencies (eg. "droppable", "other frames depend on me", "I depend on other frames", etc).
				Each sample (video frame) in the CMSampleBuffer would need its own attachment in this case.
				Another sample-level attachment example is SMPTE timecode acquired during capture. To get and
				set a CMSampleBuffer's buffer-level attachments, use the APIs in in CMAttachmentBearer.h
				(CMGetAttachment et al).

				It is possible for a CMSampleBuffer to describe samples it does not yet contain. For example, 
				some media services may have access to sample size, timing and format information before the
				data is read. Such services may create CMSampleBuffers with that information and insert them
				into queues early, and attach (or fill) the CMBlockBuffers of media data later, when the
				data becomes ready.  To this end, CMSampleBuffers have the concept of data-readiness, which can
				be tested, set, forced to become ready "now", etc.
				
				It is also possible for a CMSampleBuffer to contain nothing but a special buffer-level
				attachment that describes a media stream event (eg. "discontinuity: drain and reset decoder
				before processing the next CMSampleBuffer").  Such a special attachment can also be attached
				to regular CMSampleBuffers (ie. that contain media sample data), and if so, the event it
				describes is defined to occur after the samples in that CMSampleBuffer.

				IMPORTANT: Clients of CMSampleBuffer must explicitly manage the retain count by 
				calling CFRetain and CFRelease, even in processes using garbage collection.  

				Objective-C code that may run under garbage collection should NOT use [sbuf retain],
				or [sbuf release]; these will not have the correct effect.

		Usual care should be taken when setting attachments on sample buffers whose orgins and destinations are ambiguous.  For example, CMSetAttachment() is not thread-safe, and CMSampleBuffers may be used in multiple sample buffer streams in a given system.

				If there are no sample sizes in the provided sample buffer, kCMSampleBufferError_CannotSubdivide will be returned.
				This will happen, for example, if the samples in the buffer are non-contiguous (eg. non-interleaved audio, where
				the channel values for a single sample are scattered through the buffer).

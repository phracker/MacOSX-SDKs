/*!	@class		AUAudioUnit
	@brief		An audio unit instance.
	@discussion
		AUAudioUnit is a host interface to an audio unit. Hosts can instantiate either version 2 or
		version 3 units with this class, and to some extent control whether an audio unit is
		instantiated in-process or in a separate extension process.
		
		Implementors of version 3 audio units can and should subclass AUAudioUnit. To port an
		existing version 2 audio unit easily, AUAudioUnitV2Bridge can be subclassed.
		
		These are the ways in which audio unit components can be registered:
		
		- (v2) Packaged into a component bundle containing an `AudioComponents` Info.plist entry,
		referring to an `AudioComponentFactoryFunction`. See AudioComponent.h.
		
		- (v2) AudioComponentRegister(). Associates a component description with an
		AudioComponentFactoryFunction. See AudioComponent.h.
		
		- (v3) Packaged into an app extension containing an AudioComponents Info.plist entry.
		The principal class must conform to the AUAudioUnitFactory protocol, which will typically
		instantiate an AUAudioUnit subclass.

		- (v3) `+[AUAudioUnit registerSubclass:asComponentDescription:name:version:]`. Associates
		a component description with an AUAudioUnit subclass.
		
		A host need not be aware of the concrete subclass of AUAudioUnit that is being instantiated.
		`initWithComponentDescription:options:error:` ensures that the proper subclass is used.
		
		When using AUAudioUnit with a v2 audio unit, or the C AudioComponent and AudioUnit API's
		with a v3 audio unit, all major pieces of functionality are bridged between the
		two API's. This header describes, for each v3 method or property, the v2 equivalent.

		Hosts can observe a bus property across all busses by using KVO on this object, without
		having to observe it on each individual bus. (One could add listeners to individual busses,
		but that means one has to observe bus count changes and add/remove listeners in response.
		Also, NSArray's addObserver:toObjectsAtIndexes:forKeyPath:options:context: is problematic;
		it does not let the individual objects override the observation request, and so a bus which
		is proxying a bus in an extension process does not get the message.)

		Some audio units (e.g. mixers) support variable numbers of busses, via subclassing. When the
		bus count changes, a KVO notification is sent on "inputBusses" or "outputBusses," as
		appropriate.

		Subclassers should see also the AUAudioUnitBusImplementation category.
		
		The bus array is bridged to the v2 property kAudioUnitProperty_ElementCount.

/*!	@property	contextPresentationLatency
	@brief		Information about latency in the audio unit's processing context.
	@discussion
		This should not be confused with the audio unit's latency property, where the audio unit
		describes to the host any processing latency it introduces between its input and its output.
		
		A host may set this property to describe to the audio unit the presentation latency of its
		input and/or output audio data. Latency is described in seconds. A value of zero means
		either no latency or an unknown latency.
		
		A host should set this property on each active bus, since, for example, the audio routing
		path to each of multiple output busses may differ.
		
		For input busses:
			Describes how long ago the audio arriving on this bus was acquired. For instance, when
			reading from a file to the first audio unit in a chain, the input presentation latency
			is zero. For audio input from a device, this initial input latency is the presentation
			latency of the device itself, i.e. the device's safety offset and latency.
			
			A second chained audio unit's input presentation latency will be the input presentation
			latency of the first unit, plus the processing latency of the first unit.
			
		For output busses:
			Describes how long it will be before the output audio of an audio unit is presented. For
			instance, when writing to a file, the output presentation latency of the last audio unit
			in a chain is zero. When the audio from that audio unit is to be played to a device,
			then that initial presentation latency will be the presentation latency of the device
			itself, which is the I/O buffer size, plus the device's safety offset and latency
			
			A previous chained audio unit's output presentation latency is the last unit's
			presentation latency plus its processing latency.
			
		So, for a given audio unit anywhere within a mixing graph, the input and output presentation 
		latencies describe to that unit how long from the moment of generation it has taken for its 
		input to arrive, and how long it will take for its output to be presented.

	These constants are returned by the AVAssetReader status property to indicate whether it can successfully read samples from its asset.

 @constant	 AVAssetReaderStatusUnknown
	Indicates that the status of the asset reader is not currently known.
 @constant	 AVAssetReaderStatusReading
	Indicates that the asset reader is successfully reading samples from its asset.
 @constant	 AVAssetReaderStatusCompleted
	Indicates that the asset reader has successfully read all of the samples in its time range.
 @constant	 AVAssetReaderStatusFailed
	Indicates that the asset reader can no longer read samples from its asset because of an error. The error is described by the value of the asset reader's error property.
 @constant	 AVAssetReaderStatusCancelled
	Indicates that the asset reader can no longer read samples because reading was canceled with the cancelReading method.

 @class AVAssetReader
 @abstract
	AVAssetReader provides services for obtaining media data from an asset.
 
 @discussion
	Instances of AVAssetReader read media data from an instance of AVAsset, whether the asset is file-based or represents an assembly of media data from multiple sources, as is the case with AVComposition.
	
	Clients of AVAssetReader can read data from specific tracks of an asset and in specific formats by adding concrete instances of AVAssetReaderOutput to an AVAssetReader instance.
	
	AVAssetReaderTrackOutput, a concrete subclass of AVAssetReaderOutput, can either read the track's media samples in the format in which they are stored by the asset or convert the media samples to a different format.
	
	AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput mixes multiple audio tracks of the asset after reading them, while AVAssetReaderVideoCompositionOutput composites multiple video tracks after reading them.

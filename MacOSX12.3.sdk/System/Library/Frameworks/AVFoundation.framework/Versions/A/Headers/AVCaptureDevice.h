 @abstract
    An AVCaptureDevice represents a physical device that provides realtime input media data, such as video and audio.
 
 @discussion
    Each instance of AVCaptureDevice corresponds to a device, such as a camera or microphone. Instances of AVCaptureDevice cannot be created directly. An array of all currently available devices can also be obtained using the AVCaptureDeviceDiscoverySession. Devices can provide one or more streams of a given media type. Applications can search for devices matching desired criteria by using AVCaptureDeviceDiscoverySession, or may obtain a reference to the default device matching desired criteria by using +[AVCaptureDevice defaultDeviceWithDeviceType:mediaType:position:].
 
    Instances of AVCaptureDevice can be used to provide media data to an AVCaptureSession by creating an AVCaptureDeviceInput with the device and adding that to the capture session.

    On iOS, use of AVCaptureDevice's setActiveFormat: and AVCaptureSession's setSessionPreset: are mutually exclusive. If you set a capture device's active format, the session to which it is attached changes its preset to AVCaptureSessionPresetInputPriority. Likewise if you set the AVCaptureSession's sessionPreset property, the session assumes control of its input devices, and configures their activeFormat appropriately. Note that audio devices do not expose any user-configurable formats on iOS. To configure audio input on iOS, you should use the AVAudioSession APIs instead (see AVAudioSession.h).
 
    The activeFormat, activeVideoMinFrameDuration, and activeVideoMaxFrameDuration properties may be set simultaneously by using AVCaptureSession's begin/commitConfiguration methods:
 
    [session beginConfiguration]; // the session to which the receiver's AVCaptureDeviceInput is added.

To limit the max frame rate of the capture device, clients may set this property to a value supported by the receiver's activeFormat (see AVCaptureDeviceFormat's videoSupportedFrameRateRanges property). Clients may set this property's value to kCMTimeInvalid to return activeVideoMinFrameDuration to its default value for the given activeFormat.

    Clients can observe automatic changes to the receiver's activeVideoMinFrameDuration by key value observing this property.
 
    On iOS, the receiver's activeVideoMinFrameDuration resets to its default value under the following conditions:

        - The receiver's AVCaptureDeviceInput's session's sessionPreset changes
        - The receiver's AVCaptureDeviceInput is added to a session
 
    When exposureMode is AVCaptureExposureModeCustom, setting the activeVideoMinFrameDuration affects max frame rate, but not exposureDuration. You may use setExposureModeCustomWithDuration:ISO:completionHandler: to set a shorter exposureDuration than your activeVideoMinFrameDuration, if desired.

    An AVCaptureDevice's activeVideoMaxFrameDuration property is the reciprocal of its active minimum frame rate. To limit the min frame rate of the capture device, clients may set this property to a value supported by the receiver's activeFormat (see AVCaptureDeviceFormat's videoSupportedFrameRateRanges property).

        - The receiver's AVCaptureDeviceInput is added to a session
 
    When exposureMode is AVCaptureExposureModeCustom, frame rate and exposure duration are interrelated. If you call setExposureModeCustomWithDuration:ISO:completionHandler: with an exposureDuration longer than the current activeVideoMaxFrameDuration, the activeVideoMaxFrameDuration will be lengthened to accommodate the longer exposure time. Setting a shorter exposure duration does not automatically change the activeVideoMinFrameDuration or activeVideoMaxFrameDuration. To explicitly increase the frame rate in custom exposure mode, you must set the activeVideoMaxFrameDuration to a shorter value. If your new max frame duration is shorter than the current exposureDuration, the exposureDuration will shorten as well to accommodate the new frame rate.

    This property indicates whether the capture device is currently subject to an elevated system pressure condition.

 @enum AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehavior
 @abstract
    These constants can be used to control when the virtual device is allowed to switch the active primary constituent device.
 
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorUnsupported
    Indicates that the device does not support constituent device switching. This is reported for cameras that do not have more than one constituent device.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorAuto
    Automatically select the best camera for the current scene. In this mode there are no restrictions on when a camera switch can occur.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorRestricted
    Restrict fallback camera selection to certain conditions (see AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditions). Camera switches necessary to satisfy the requested video zoom factor are still allowed without restriction.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorLocked
    Lock camera switching to the active primary constituent device. Note that this restricts the minAvailableVideoZoomFactor to the switch-over zoom factor of the activePrimaryConstituentDevice (as reported in AVCaptureDevice.virtualDeviceSwitchOverVideoZoomFactors).
 
 @discussion
    Virtual devices with multiple constituent video devices (such as the Dual Camera, Dual Wide Camera, or Triple Camera), consist of cameras that each have different properties such as focal length, maximum light sensitivity, and minimum focus distance. One of the constituent video devices is selected as the primary constituent device. For an AVCaptureSession, the primary constituent device produces for all outputs. For an AVCaptureMultiCamSession, the primary constituent device produces for all outputs connected to the virtual device's native AVCaptureDeviceInputPort (where its sourceDeviceType is equal to the virtual device's deviceType).

    When the requested zoom factor can be achieved by multiple constituent cameras (see -virtualDeviceSwitchOverVideoZoomFactors), the virtual device chooses the best camera for the scene. The primary condition for this is the focal length; the camera with the longest focal length requires the least amount of digital upscaling and therefore normally provides the highest image quality. Secondary conditions are focus and exposure; when the scene requires focus or exposure to go beyond the limits of the active primary constituent device, a camera with a shorter focal length may be able to deliver a better quality image. Such a device is called a fallback primary constituent device. For example, a telephoto camera with a minimum focus distance of 40cm is not able to deliver a sharp image when the subject in the scene is closer than 40cm. For such a scene, the virtual device will switch to the wide-angle camera which typically has a smaller minimum focus distance and is able to achieve accurate focus on the subject. In this case the wide-angle camera is the fallback primary constitute device.

 @enum AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditions
 @abstract
    These constants can be used and combined to control the conditions that allow fallback camera selection when the primaryConstituentDeviceSelectionBehavior is set to AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorRestricted. Note that camera switching necessary to satisfy the requested zoom factor is still allowed.
 
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionNone
    Disallow fallback switching.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionVideoZoomChanged
    Restrict fallback camera switching to when the video zoom factor changes, either through AVCaptureDevice.videoZoomFactor or -[AVCaptureDevice rampToVideoZoomFactor:withRate:]. Note that any change in video zoom factor will allow a switch to a fallback camera, not just changes across switch-over zoom factors.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionFocusModeChanged
    Restrict fallback camera switches to when AVCaptureDevice.focusMode is set.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionExposureModeChanged
    Restrict fallback camera switches to when AVCaptureDevice.exposureMode is set.
 
 @discussion
    Whenever triggered by one or more of the enabled conditions, the fallback camera switching waits for exposure and focus to stabilize before deciding which camera to use as the primary constituent device.
 
    Whenever AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionVideoZoomChanged is not included in the restricted switching behavior conditions, AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorRestricted still allows camera selection when a change in video zoom factor makes a camera eligible or ineligible to be selected as the activePrimaryConstituentDevice. When the video zoom factor decreases to below the switch-over zoom factor of the activePrimaryConstituentDevice, a different camera will be selected to satisfy the requested zoom factor. When the video zoom factor increases and crosses a camera's switch-over zoom factor, this camera becomes eligible to be selected as the activePrimaryConstituentDevice. If exposure and focus allow, this camera then becomes the new activePrimaryConstituentDevice. Similar to the AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionVideoZoomChanged this also waits for exposure and focus to stabilize. Otherwise the activePrimaryConstituentDevice remains unchanged.

    When an AVCaptureDevice's exposureMode is set to AVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose or AVCaptureExposureModeContinuousAutoExposure, the auto exposure algorithm picks a default max exposure duration that is tuned for the current configuration, balancing low light image quality with motion preservation.

Setting the property to the special value of kCMTimeInvalid resets the auto exposure max duration to the device's default for your current configuration. When the device's activeFormat or the AVCaptureSession's sessionPreset changes, this property resets to the default max exposure duration for the new format or session preset.
 
    On some devices, the auto exposure algorithm picks a different max exposure duration for a given format depending whether you used the -[AVCaptureSession setSessionPreset:] API or the -[AVCaptureDevice setActiveFormat:] API to set the format.

    Tone mapping is a technique used by the device to map the pixel levels in high dynamic range images to a more limited dynamic range (such as 16 bit to 8 bit), while still retaining as close an appearance as possible. Normally the device employs adaptive, local tone curves to preserve highest image quality and adapt quickly to changing lighting conditions.
 
    This property indicates to the receiver to use a global tone map. If set to YES, the tone map is adjusted dynamically depending on the current scene and the same tone map is applied to all pixels in an image.

Setting globalToneMappingEnabled throws an NSGenericException if called without first obtaining exclusive access to the receiver using lockForConfiguration:.
 
    When global tone mapping is enabled, an AVCapturePhotoOutput connected to the AVCaptureDeviceInput’s session disables all forms of still image fusion, resulting in still images with no automatic stabilization applied.

 @discussion
    By default, an AVCaptureDevice attached to an AVCaptureSession is automatically configured for wide color by the AVCaptureSession (see AVCaptureSession automaticallyConfiguresCaptureDeviceForWideColor). You may also set the activeColorSpace manually. To prevent the AVCaptureSession from undoing your work, remember to set AVCaptureSession's automaticallyConfiguresCaptureDeviceForWideColor property to NO. Changing the receiver's activeColorSpace while the session is running requires a disruptive reconfiguration of the capture render pipeline. Movie captures in progress will be ended immediately; unfulfilled photo requests will be aborted; video preview will temporarily freeze. -setActiveColorSpace: throws an NSGenericException if called without first obtaining exclusive access to the receiver using -lockForConfiguration:.

 @property geometricDistortionCorrectionSupported
 @abstract
    Indicates that geometric distortion correction is supported by the receiver.
 
 @discussion
    Some AVCaptureDevices benefit from geometric distortion correction (GDC), such as devices with a very wide field of view. GDC lessens the fisheye effect at the outer edge of the frame at the cost of losing a small amount of vertical and horizontal field of view. When GDC is enabled on the AVCaptureDevice (see geometricDistortionEnabled), the corrected image is upscaled to the original image size when needed.  With respect to the AVCaptureDevice.videoZoomFactor API, the full viewable field of view is always represented with a videoZoomFactor of 1.0. Thus, when GDC is enabled, the AVCaptureDevice.activeFormat's field of view at videoZoomFactor = 1.0 will be different than when GDC is disabled. The smaller field of view is reported through the activeFormat's geometricDistortionCorrectedVideoFieldOfView property. Beware though that RAW photo captures never have GDC applied, regardless of the value of AVCaptureDevice.geometricDistortionCorrectionEnabled.

    videoHDRSupported is a BOOL indicating whether the format supports high dynamic range streaming, also known as Extended Dynamic Range (EDR). When enabled, the device streams at twice the published frame rate, capturing an under-exposed frame and correctly exposed frame for each frame time at the published rate. Portions of the under-exposed frame are combined with the correctly exposed frame to recover detail in darker areas of the scene. EDR is a separate and distinct feature from 10-bit HDR video (first seen in 2020 iPhones). 10-bit formats with HLG BT2020 color space have greater dynamic range by virtue of their expanded bit depth and HLG transfer function, and when captured in movies, contain Dolby Vision metadata. They are, in effect, "always on" HDR. And thus the videoHDRSupported property is always NO for 10-bit formats only supporting HLG BT2020 colorspace, since HDR cannot be enabled or disabled. To enable videoHDR (EDR), set the AVCaptureDevice.videoHDREnabled property.

 @discussion
    By default, AVCapturePhotoOutput and AVCaptureStillImageOutput emit images with the same dimensions as their source AVCaptureDevice's activeFormat.formatDescription property. Some device formats support high resolution photo output. That is, they can stream video to an AVCaptureVideoDataOutput or AVCaptureMovieFileOutput at one resolution while outputting photos to AVCapturePhotoOutput at a higher resolution. You may query this property to discover a video format's supported high resolution still image dimensions. See -[AVCapturePhotoOutput highResolutionPhotoEnabled], -[AVCapturePhotoSettings highResolutionPhotoEnabled], and -[AVCaptureStillImageOutput highResolutionStillImageOutputEnabled].
 
    AVCaptureDeviceFormats of type AVMediaTypeDepthData may also support the delivery of a higher resolution depth data map to an AVCapturePhotoOutput. Chief differences are:
       - Depth data accompanying still images is not supported by AVCaptureStillImageOutput. You must use AVCapturePhotoOutput.
       - By opting in for depth data ( -[AVCapturePhotoSettings setDepthDataDeliveryEnabled:YES] ), you implicitly opt in for high resolution depth data if it's available. You may query the -[AVCaptureDevice activeDepthDataFormat]'s highResolutionStillImageDimensions to discover the depth data resolution that will be delivered with captured photos.

    If an AVCaptureDeviceFormat's highPhotoQualitySupported property is YES, the format produces higher image quality when selecting .balanced or .quality AVCapturePhotoQualityPrioritization compared to .speed. Such formats adhere to the following rules:
        - Photo requests with a prioritization of .speed produce the fastest image result (suitable for burst captures).
        - Photo requests with a prioritization of .balanced produce higher image quality without dropping frames if a video recording is underway.
        - Photo requests with a prioritization of .quality produce high image quality and may cause frame drops if a video recording is underway. For maximum backward compatibility, photo requests on high photo quality formats set to .quality only cause video frame drops if your app is linked on or after iOS 15.
    Formats that don't support high photo quality produce the same image quality whether you select .speed, .balanced, or .quality. Note that high photo quality is only attainable when using the AVCapturePhotoOutput with these supported formats.

For instance, on apps linked against iOS versions earlier than 12.0, the photo resolution video formats may not be used as sources for AVCaptureMovieFileOutput due to bandwidth limitations. On DualCamera devices, AVCaptureDepthDataOutput is not supported when outputting full resolution (i.e. 12 MP) video due to bandwidth limitations. In order to stream depth data plus video data from a photo format, ensure that your AVCaptureVideoDataOutput's deliversPreviewSizedOutputBuffers property is set to YES. Likewise, to stream depth data while capturing video to a movie file using AVCaptureMovieFileOutput, call -[AVCaptureSession setSessionPreset:AVCaptureSessionPresetPhoto]. When using the photo preset, video is captured at preview resolution rather than the full sensor resolution.

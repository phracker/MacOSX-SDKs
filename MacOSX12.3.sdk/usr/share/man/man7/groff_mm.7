groff_mm \- groff mm macros
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B groff
.B \-mm
[
.IR options .\|.\|.
]
[
.IR files .\|.\|.
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The groff mm macros are intended to be compatible with the DWB mm macros
with the following limitations:
.TP
.B \(bu
no Bell Labs localisms implemented.
.TP
.B \(bu
the macros OK and PM are not implemented.
.TP
.B \(bu
groff mm does not support cut marks
.LP
\fBmm\fP is intended to be international.
Therefore it is 
possible to write short national macrofiles which change all
english text to the preferred language.
Use \fBmmse\fP as an example.
.\"########################################################################
.LP
A file called \fBlocale\fP or \fIlang\fP\fB_locale\fP is read
after the initiation of the global variables.
It is therefore
possible to localize the macros with companyname and so on.
.sp
In this manual square brackets is used to show optional arguments.
.sp 3
\fBNumber registers and strings\fP
.br
Many macros can be controlled by number registers and strings.
A number register is assigned with the \fBnr\fP command:
.br
\fB\&.nr\fP \fIXXX\fP \fI[+-]n [i]\fP
.br
\fBXXX\fP is the name of the register, \fBn\fP is the value to
be assigned, and \fBi\fP is increment value for auto-increment.
\fBn\fP can have a plus or minus sign as prefix if an increment
or decrement of the current value is wanted.
(Auto-increment or decrement
occurs if the number register is used with a plus or minus sign,
\fB\en+[XXX]\fP or \fB\en-[XXX]\fP.)
.sp
Strings is defined with \fBds\fP.
.br
\fB\&.ds\fP \fIYYY string\fP
.br
The string is assigned everything to the end of the line, even blanks.
Initial blanks in \fIstring\fP should be prefixed with
a double-quote.
(Strings are used in the text as \fB\e*[YYY]\fP.)
.sp
\fBSpecial formatting of number registers\fP
.br
A number register is printed with normal digits if no format has been
given.
Set the format with \fBaf\fP:
.br
\fB\&.af\fP \fIR c\fP
.br
\fIR\fP is the name of the register, \fIc\fP is the format.

item.
.TP
.B "COVER [arg]"
\&\fBCOVER\fP begins a coversheet definition.
It is important
that \fB.COVER\fP appears before any normal text.
\&\fB.COVER\fP uses \fIarg\fP to build the filename 
/usr/share/groff/1.19.2/tmac/mm/\fIarg\fP.cov.
Therefore it is possible to create unlimited
types of coversheets.
\fIms.cov\fP is supposed to look like the \fBms\fP coversheet.
\&\fB.COVER\fP requires a \fB.COVEND\fP at the end of the coverdefinition.
Always use this order of the covermacros:
.nf
\&.COVER
\&.TL
\&.AF
\&.AU
\&.AT
\&.AS
\&.AE
\&.COVEND
.fi
However, only \fB.TL\fP and \fB.AU\fP are required.

Section headers can have a level between 1 and 14, level 1 is the
top level.
The text is given in \fIheading-text\fP, and must be
surrounded by double quotes if it contains spaces.
\fBHeading-suffix\fP is added to the header in the text but not in
the table of contents.
This is normally used for footnote marks
and similar things.
Don't use \fB\e*F\fP in \fIheading-suffix\fP, it won't
work.
A manual label must be used, see \fBFS\fP.
.sp
An eventual paragraph, \fBP\fP, directly after \fBH\fP will be
ignored, \fBH\fP is taking care of spacing and indentation.
.sp
\fBPage ejection before heading\fP
.br
Number register \fBEj\fP controls page ejection before the heading.
Normally, a level one heading gets two blank lines before it, higher levels
gets only one.
A new page is ejected before each
first-level heading if number register \fBEj\fP is 1.
All levels below or equal the value of \fBEj\fP gets a new page.
Default value for \fBEj\fP is 0.
.sp

or equal to number register \fBHb\fP.
Default value 2.
.sp
\fBHeading space level\fP
.br
A blank line is inserted after the heading if the heading level is less
or equal to number register \fBHs\fP.
Default value 2.
.sp
Text will follow the heading on the same line if the level is greater
than both \fBHb\fP and \fBHs\fP.
.sp
\fBPost-heading indent\fP

.in
.sp
\fBCentered section headings\fP
.br
All headings whose level is equal or below number register \fBHc\fP
and also less than or equal to \fBHb\fP or \fBHs\fP
is centerered.
.sp
\fBFont control of the heading\fP
.br
The font of each heading level is controlled by string \fBHF\fP.
It contains a fontnumber or fontname for each level.
Default
is \fB2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\fP (all headings in italic).
Could also be written as \fBI\ I\ I\ I\ I\ I\ I\ I\ I\ I\ I\ I\ I\ I\fP.
Note that some other implementations use \fB3\ 3\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\ 2\fP as the
default value.
All omitted values are presumed to be a 1.
.sp
\fBPoint size control\fP.
.br
String \fBHP\fP controls the pointsize of each heading, in the
same way as \fBHF\fP controls the font.
A value of 0 selects the default point size.
Default value is \fB0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\fP.
Beware that only the
point size changes, not the vertical size.
That can be controlled by the user specified macro \fBHX\fP and/or
\fBHZ\fP.
.sp
\fBHeading counters\fP
.br
Fourteen number registers, named \fBH1\fP thru \fBH14\fP contains
the counter for each heading level.
The values are printed using arabic numerals, this can be changed
with the macro \fBHM\fP (see below).
All marks are concatenated before printing.
To avoid this, set
number register \fBHt\fP to\ 1.
That will only print the current
heading counter at each heading.
.sp
\fBAutomatic table of contents\fP
.br
All headings whose level is equal or below number register \fBCl\fP
is saved to be printed in the table of contents.
Default value is\ 2.
.sp
\fBSpecial control of the heading, user-defined macros\fP.
.br
These macros can be defined by the user to get a finer control
of vertical spacing, fonts or other features.
Argument \fIlevel\fP is the level-argument to \fBH\fP, but
0 for unnumbered headings (see \fBHU\fP).
Argument \fIrlevel\fP is the real level, it is
set to number register \fBHu\fP for unnumbered headings.
Argument \fIheading-text\fP is the text argument to \fBH\fP and \fBHU\fP.
.sp
\fBHX\ \fP\fIlevel\ rlevel\ heading-text\fP
.br
\fBHX\fP is called just before the printing of the heading.
The following register is available for \fBHX\fP.
\fBHX\fP may alter \fB}0\fP, \fB}2\fP and \fB;3\fP.
.in +.5i
.T3 "string }0"
Contains the heading mark plus two spaces if \fIrlevel\fP is non-zero,
otherwise empty.
.T3 "register ;0"
Contains the position of the text after the heading.
0 means that the text should follow the heading on the same line, 1
means that a line break should occur before the text and
2 means that a blank line should separate the heading and the text.
.T3 "string }2"
Contains two spaces if register \fB;0\fP is\ 0.
It is used to
separate the heading from the text.

.B "INITR filename"
Initialize the refencemacros.
References will be written to stderr and is supposed to
be written to \fIfilename.qrf\fP. 
Requires two passes with groff, this is handled by a
separate program called \fBmmroff\fP, the reason is that
groff is often installed without the unsafe operations that
\fBINITR\fP requiered.
The first pass looks for references and the second one includes them.
\fBINITR\fP can be used several times, but it is only the first
occurrence of \fBINITR\fP that is active.

.B "INDP"
\fBINDP\fP prints the index by running the command specified
by string variable \fBIndcmd\fP, normally \fIsort\ -t\et\fP.
\fBINDP\fP reads the output from the command to form
the index, normally in two columns (can be changed by defining \fBTYIND\fP).
The index is printed with string variable \fBIndex\fP as header,
default is \fBINDEX\fP.
One-column processing is
returned after the list.
\fBINDP\fP will call the
user-defined macros \fBTXIND\fP, \fBTYIND\fP and \fBTZIND\fP if defined.
\fBTXIND\fP is called before printing \fBINDEX\fP, \fBTYIND\fP
is called instead of printing \fBINDEX\fP.
\fBTZIND\fP is called
after the printing and should take care of restoring to normal
operation again.
.TP
.B "ISODATE [0]"
\fBISODATE\fP changes the predefined date string in \fBDT\fP to
ISO-format, ie YYYY-MM-DD.
This can also be done by

.TP
.B "LB text-indent mark-indent pad type [mark [LI-space [LB-space]]]"
List begin macro.
This is the common macro used for all lists.
\fIText-indent\fP is the number of spaces to indent the text from the
current indent.
.sp
\fIPad\fP and \fImark-indent\fP controls where to put the mark.
The mark is placed within the mark area, and \fImark-indent\fP
sets the number of spaces before this area.
It is normally\ 0.
The mark area ends where the text begins.
The start of the text
is still controlled by \fItext-indent\fP.
.sp
The mark is left justified whitin the mark area if \fIpad\fP is 0.
If \fIpad\fP is greater than 0, then \fImark-indent\fP is ignored, and
the mark is placed \fIpad\fP spaces before the text.
This will right justify the mark.
.sp
If \fItype\fP is 0 the list will have either a hanging indent or, if
argument \fImark\fP is given, the string \fImark\fP as mark.
.sp
If \fItype\fP is greater than 0 automatic numbering will occur, arabic
if \fImark\fP is empty.
\fIMark\fP can then be any of \fB1\fP, \fBA\fP,
\fBa\fP, \fBI\fP or \fBi\fP.

.TP
.B "LC [list-level]"
List-status clear.
Terminates all current active lists down to \fIlist-level\fP, or 0
if no argmuent is given.
This is used by \fBH\fP to clear any
active list.
.TP
.B "LE [1]"
List end.
Terminate the current list.
\fBLE\fP outputs a blank line
if an argument is given.
.TP
.B "LI [mark [1]]"
List item precedes every item in a list.
Without argument \fBLI\fP
will print the mark determined by the current list type.
By giving
\fBLI\fP one argument, it will use that as the mark instead.
Two arguments to \fBLI\fP will make \fImark\fP a prefix to
the current mark.
There will be no separating space between the prefix
and the mark if the second argument is \fB2\fP instead of \fB1\fP.
This behaviour can also be achieved by setting number register
\fBLimsp\fP to zero.
A zero length \fImark\fP will make a hanging
indent instead.
.sp
A blank line is normally printed before the list item.
This behaviour
can be controlled by number register \fBLs\fP.
Pre-spacing
will occur for each list-level less than or equal to \fBLs\fP.
Default value is\ 99.
(Nesting of lists is unlimited.\ :-)
.sp
The indentation can be changed thru number register \fBLi\fP.
Default is 6.

.B "MULB cw1 space1 [cw2 space2 [cw3 ...]]"
Begin a special multi-column mode.
Every columns width must be specified.
Also the space between the columns must be specified.
The last column
does not need any space-definition.
\fBMULB\fP starts a diversion and \fBMULE\fP

\fBP\fP without argument will produce left justified text, even
the first line of the paragraph.
This is the same as setting
\fItype\fP to 0.
If the argument is\ 1, then the first line
of text following \fBP\fP will be indented by the number of
spaces in number register \fBPi\fP, normally 5.
.sp
Instead of giving 1 as argument to \fBP\fP it is possible to set the
paragraph type in number register \fBPt\fP.
Using 0 and\ 1
will be the same as adding that value to \fBP\fP.
A value of 2 will indent all paragraphs, except after
headings, lists and displays.

It is normally the first command in a file, though it's not necessary.
\fBPGFORM\fP can be used without arguments 
to reset everything after a \fBMOVE\fP.
A line-break is done unless the fourth argument is given.
This can be used to avoid the pagenumber on the first page while setting
new width and length.

Otherwise it will skip \fIpages\fP pages.
.TP
.B "SM string1 [string2 [string3]]"
Make a string smaller.
If \fIstring2\fP is given, \fIstring1\fP will be smaller and \fIstring2\fP
normal, concatenated with \fIstring1\fP.
With three argument, all is
concatenated, but only \fIstring2\fP is made smaller.
.TP
.B "SP [lines]"
Space vertically.
\fIlines\fP can have any scalingfactor, like \fI3i\fP or
\fI8v\fP.
Several \fBSP\fP in a line will only produce the
maximum number of lines, not the sum.
\fBSP\fP will also be ignored
until the first textline in a page.
Add a \fB\e&\fP before \fBSP\fP
to avoid this.
.TP
.B TAB
reset tabs to every\ 5n.
Normally used to reset any previous tabpositions.
.TP
.B "TB [title [override [flag [refname]]]]"
Table title, arguments are the same as for \fBEC\fP.
\fBTB\fP uses the number register \fBTb\fP as counter.
The string \fBLt\fP controls the title of the
List of Tables, default is \fILIST OF TABLES\fP.
The List of Tables will only be printed if number register \fBLt\fP
is 1, default 1.
The string \fBLitb\fP contains the word \fITABLE\fP, wich
is printed before the number.
.br
Special handling of the title will occur if
\fBTB\fP is used inside \fBDS\fP/\fBDE\fP, it will not be
affected by the format of \fBDS\fP.
.TP
.B "TC [slevel [spacing [tlevel [tab [h1 [h2 [h3 [h4 [h5]]]]]]]]]"
Table of contents.
This macro is normally used at the last line of the document.
It generates a table of contents with headings up to the level
controlled by number register \fBCl\fP.
Note that \fBCl\fP controls
the saving of headings, it has nothing to do with \fBTC\fP.
Headings with level less than or equal to \fIslevel\fP will get
\fIspacing\fP number of lines before them.
Headings with level less than or equal to \fItlevel\fP will have
their page numbers right justified with dots or spaces separating
the text and the page number.
Spaces is used if \fItab\fP
is greater than zero, otherwise dots.
Other headings will have the
page number directly at the end of the heading text (\fIragged right\fP).
.sp
The rest of the arguments will be printed, centered, before the
table of contents.
.sp
The user-defined macros \fBTX\fP and \fBTY\fP are used if \fBTC\fP is called
with at most four arguments.
\fBTX\fP is called before the printing
of \fICONTENTS\fP, and \fBTY\fP is called instead of printing \fICONTENTS\fP.
.sp
Equivalent macros can be defined for list of figures, tables, equations
and excibits by defining \fBTXxx\fP or \fBTYxx\fP, where \fBxx\fP
is \fBFg\fP, \fBTB\fP, \fBEC\fP or \fBEX\fP.
.sp
String \fBCi\fP can be set to control the indentations for each heading-level.
It must be scaled, like \fB.ds\ Ci\ .25i\ .5i\ .75i\ 1i\ 1i\fP.
The indentation is normally controlled by the maxlength of headings
in each level.
.sp
All texts can be redefined, new stringvariables 
\fILifg\fP, \fILitb\fP, \fILiex\fP, \fILiec\fP and \fILicon\fP contain

the second argument.
By specifying the font-argument
it is possible to use another font instead of courier.
\fIflag\fP controls several special features.
It contains the sum of all wanted features.
.in +.5i
.T2 Value
Description
.T2 1
Disable the escape-character (\e).

.SH INTERNALS
The letter macros is using different submacros depending on
the letter type.
The name of the submacro has the letter type
as suffix.
It is therefore possible to define other letter types, either
in the national macro-file, or as local additions.
\&\fB.LT\fP will set the number variables \fBPt\fP and \fBPi\fP to 0 and 5.
The following strings and macros must be defined for a new letter type:
.TP
\fBlet@init_\fP\fItype\fP
This macro is called directly by \fB.LT\fP.
It is supposed to initialize
variables and other stuff.
.TP
\fBlet@head_\fP\fItype\fP
This macro prints the letter head, and is called instead of the
normal page header.
It is supposed to remove the alias \fBlet@header\fP,
otherwise it will be called for all pages.
.TP
\fBlet@sg_\fP\fItype\ name\ title\ n\ flag\ [arg1\ [arg2\ [...]]]\fP
\&\fB.SG\fP is calling this macro only for letters, memorandums has
its own processing.
\fIname\fP and \fItitle\fP is specified
thru \fB.WA\fP/\fB.WB\fP.
\fIn\fP is the counter, 1-max, and
\fIflag\fP is true for the last name.
Any other argument to \fB.SG\fP
is appended.
.TP
\fBlet@fc_\fP\fItype\ closing\fP
This macro is called by \fB.FC\fP, and has the
formal closing as argument.
.LP
\&\fB.LO\fP is implemented as a general option-macro.
\fB.LO\fP demands
that a string named \fBLet\fP\fItype\fP is defined, where \fItype\fP
is the letter type.
\&\fB.LO\fP will then assign the argument to the string
variable \fBlet*lo-\fP\fItype\fP.

.Sh NAME
.Nm sigblock
.Nd block signals
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In signal.h
.Ft int
.Fn sigblock "int mask"
.Ft int
.Fn sigmask signum
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is made obsolete by
.Xr sigprocmask 2 .
.Ef
.Pp
.Fn Sigblock
adds the signals specified in
.Fa mask
to the set of signals currently
being blocked from delivery.
Signals are blocked if the
corresponding bit in
.Fa mask
is a 1; the macro
.Fn sigmask
is provided to construct the mask for a given
.Fa signum .
.Pp
It is not possible to block
.Dv SIGKILL
or
.Dv SIGSTOP ;
this restriction is silently
imposed by the system.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The previous set of masked signals is returned.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kill 2 ,
.Xr sigaction 2 ,
.Xr sigprocmask 2 ,
.Xr sigsetmask 2 ,
.Xr sigsetops 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn sigblock
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.2
and has been deprecated.

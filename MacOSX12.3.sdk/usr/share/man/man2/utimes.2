.Dt UTIMES 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm futimes ,
.Nm utimes
.Nd set file access and modification times
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/time.h
.Ft int
.Fo futimes
.Fa "int fildes"
.Fa "const struct timeval times[2]"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fo utimes
.Fa "const char *path"
.Fa "const struct timeval times[2]"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The access and modification times of the file named by
.Fa path
or referenced by
.Fa fildes
are changed as specified by the argument
.Fa times .
.Pp
If
.Fa times
is
.Dv NULL ,
the access and modification times are set to the current time.
The caller must be the owner of the file, have permission to
write the file, or be the super-user.
.Pp
If
.Fa times
is
.Pf non- Dv NULL ,
it is assumed to point to an array of two timeval structures.
The access time is set to the value of the first element, and the
modification time is set to the value of the second element.
The caller must be the owner of the file or be the super-user.
.Pp
In either case, the inode-change-time of the file is set to the current
time.
.Sh NOTE
In case of a symbolic link 
.Fn utimes
function will set file access and modification times to the file the link 
references. The 
.Xr lutimes 3 
function will set the access and modification times to the symbolic link 
file.  
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn utimes
system call will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix;
or the
.Fa times
argument is
.Dv NULL
and the effective user ID of the process does not
match the owner of the file, and is not the super-user, and write
access is denied.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa path
or
.Fa times
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurs while reading or writing the affected inode.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links are encountered in translating the pathname.
This is taken to be indicative of a looping symbolic link.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeds
.Dv NAME_MAX
characters, or an entire path name exceeded
.Dv PATH_MAX
characters.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named file does not exist.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EPERM
The
.Fa times
argument is not
.Dv NULL
and the calling process's effective user ID
does not match the owner of the file and is not the super-user.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EROFS
The file system containing the file is mounted read-only.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn futimes
system call will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa fildes
does not refer to a valid descriptor.
.El
.Pp
All of the functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EACCES
The
.Fa times
argument is
.Dv NULL
and the effective user ID of the process does not
match the owner of the file, and is not the super-user, and write
access is denied.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa times
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading or writing the affected inode.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EPERM
The
.Fa times
argument is not
.Dv NULL
and the calling process's effective user ID
does not match the owner of the file and is not the super-user.
.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EROFS
The file system containing the file is mounted read-only.

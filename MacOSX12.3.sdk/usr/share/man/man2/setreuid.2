.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm setreuid
.Nd set real and effective user IDs
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn setreuid "uid_t ruid" "uid_t euid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The real and effective user IDs of the
current process are set according to the arguments.
If
.Fa ruid
or
.Fa euid
is -1, the current uid is filled in by the system.
Unprivileged users may change the real user
ID to the effective user ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may
make other changes.
.Pp
The
.Fn setreuid
function has been used to swap the real and effective user IDs
in set-user-ID programs to temporarily relinquish the set-user-ID value.
This purpose is now better served by the use of the
.Fn seteuid
function (see
.Xr setuid 2 ) .
.Pp
When setting the real and effective user IDs to the same value,
the standard
.Fn setuid
function is preferred.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std setreuid
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
The current process is not the super-user and a change
other than changing the effective user-id to the real user-id
was specified.

system call appeared in

.Sh NAME
.Nm fmod
.Nd floating-point remainder function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn fmod "double x" "double y"
.Ft long double
.Fn fmodl "long double x" "long double y"
.Ft float
.Fn fmodf "float x" "float y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fmod
functions compute the floating-point remainder of
.Fa x Ns / Fa y .
.Pp
Specifically, the functions return the value
.Sm off
.Fa x - Em i * Fa y ,
.Sm on
for some integer
.Em i
such that, if
.Fa y
is non-zero, the result has the same sign as
.Fa x
and magnitude less than the magnitude of
.Fa y .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn fmod "±0, y"
returns ±0 if y is neither 0 nor NaN.
.Pp
.Fn fmod "x, y"
returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception for x infinite or y zero.
.Pp
.Fn fmod "x, ±infinity"
returns x for x not infinite.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn fmod
functions to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vfmodf "vFloat x" "vFloat y" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvfmodf "float *z" "const float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvfmod "double *z" "const double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fmod
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

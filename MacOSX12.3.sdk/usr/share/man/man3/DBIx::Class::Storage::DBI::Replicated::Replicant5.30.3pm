.SH "NAME"
DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Replicant \- A replicated DBI Storage Role
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
This class is used internally by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Replicants are \s-1DBI\s0 Storages that follow a master \s-1DBI\s0 Storage.  Typically this
is accomplished via an external replication system.  Please see the documents
for DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated for more details.
.PP
This class exists to define methods of a \s-1DBI\s0 Storage that only make sense when
it's a classic 'slave' in a pool of slave databases which replicate from a
given master database.
.SH "ATTRIBUTES"
.IX Header "ATTRIBUTES"
This class defines the following attributes.
.SS "active"
.IX Subsection "active"
This is a boolean which allows you to programmatically activate or deactivate a
replicant from the pool.  This way you can do stuff like disallow a replicant
when it gets too far behind the master, if it stops replicating, etc.
.PP
This attribute \s-1DOES NOT\s0 reflect a replicant's internal status, i.e. if it is
properly replicating from a master and has not fallen too many seconds behind a
reliability threshold. For that, use
\&\*(L"is_replicating\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated and
\&\*(L"lag_behind_master\*(R" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated.
Since the implementation of those functions database specific (and not all \s-1DBIC\s0
supported DBs support replication) you should refer your database-specific
storage driver for more information.
.SS "master"
.IX Subsection "master"
Reference to the master Storage.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
This class defines the following methods.
.SS "debugobj"
.IX Subsection "debugobj"
Override the debugobj method to redirect this method call back to the master.

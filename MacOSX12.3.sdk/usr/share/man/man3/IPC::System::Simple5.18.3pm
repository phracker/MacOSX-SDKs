.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Calling Perl's in-built \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR function is easy, 
determining if it was successful is \fIhard\fR.  Let's face it,
\&\f(CW$?\fR isn't the nicest variable in the world to play with, and
even if you \fIdo\fR check it, producing a well-formatted error
string takes a lot of work.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`IPC::System::Simple\*(C'\fR takes the hard work out of calling 
external commands.  In fact, if you want to be really lazy,
you can just write:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use IPC::System::Simple qw(system);
.Ve
.PP
and all of your \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR commands will either succeed (run to
completion and return a zero exit value), or die with rich diagnostic
messages.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`IPC::System::Simple\*(C'\fR module also provides a simple replacement
to Perl's backticks operator.  Simply write:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture);
.Ve
.PP
and then use the \*(L"\fIcapture()\fR\*(R" command just like you'd use backticks.
If there's an error, it will die with a detailed description of what
went wrong.  Better still, you can even use \f(CW\*(C`capturex()\*(C'\fR to run the
equivalent of backticks, but without the shell:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use IPC::System::Simple qw(capturex);
\&
\&    my $result = capturex($command, @args);
.Ve
.PP
If you want more power than the basic interface, including the
ability to specify which exit values are acceptable, trap errors,
or process diagnostics, then read on!

.SH "ADVANCED USAGE"
.IX Header "ADVANCED USAGE"
.SS "\fIrun()\fP and \fIsystem()\fP"
.IX Subsection "run() and system()"
\&\f(CW\*(C`IPC::System::Simple\*(C'\fR provides a subroutine called
\&\f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR, that executes a command using the same semantics as
Perl's built-in \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use IPC::System::Simple qw(run);
\&
\&    run("cat *.txt");           # Execute command via the shell
\&    run("cat","/etc/motd");     # Execute command without shell
.Ve
.PP
The primary difference between Perl's in-built system and
the \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR command is that \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR will throw an exception on
failure, and allows a list of acceptable exit values to be set.
See \*(L"Exit values\*(R" for further information.
.PP
In fact, you can even have \f(CW\*(C`IPC::System::Simple\*(C'\fR replace the
default \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR function for your package so it has the
same behaviour:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use IPC::System::Simple qw(system);
\&
\&    system("cat *.txt");  # system now succeeds or dies!
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR are aliases to each other.
.PP
See also \*(L"\fIrunx()\fR, \fIsystemx()\fR and \fIcapturex()\fR\*(R" for variants of
\&\f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`run()\*(C'\fR that never invoke the shell, even with
a single argument.
.SS "\fIcapture()\fP"
.IX Subsection "capture()"
A second subroutine, named \f(CW\*(C`capture\*(C'\fR executes a command with
the same semantics as Perl's built-in backticks (and \f(CW\*(C`qx()\*(C'\fR):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture);
\&
\&    # Capture text while invoking the shell.
\&    my $file  = capture("cat /etc/motd");
\&    my @lines = capture("cat /etc/passwd");
.Ve
.PP
However unlike regular backticks, which always use the shell, \f(CW\*(C`capture\*(C'\fR
will bypass the shell when called with multiple arguments:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # Capture text while avoiding the shell.
\&    my $file  = capture("cat", "/etc/motd");
\&    my @lines = capture("cat", "/etc/passwd");
.Ve
.PP
See also \*(L"\fIrunx()\fR, \fIsystemx()\fR and \fIcapturex()\fR\*(R" for a variant of
\&\f(CW\*(C`capture()\*(C'\fR that never invokes the shell, even with a single
argument.
.SS "\fIrunx()\fP, \fIsystemx()\fP and \fIcapturex()\fP"
.IX Subsection "runx(), systemx() and capturex()"
The \f(CW\*(C`runx()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`systemx()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`capturex()\*(C'\fR commands are identical
to the multi-argument forms of \f(CW\*(C`run()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`capture()\*(C'\fR
respectively, but \fInever\fR invoke the shell, even when called with a
single argument.  These forms are particularly useful when a command's
argument list \fImight\fR be empty, for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    systemx($cmd, @args);
.Ve
.PP
The use of \f(CW\*(C`systemx()\*(C'\fR here guarantees that the shell will \fInever\fR
be invoked, even if \f(CW@args\fR is empty.
.SS "Exception handling"
.IX Subsection "Exception handling"
In the case where the command returns an unexpected status, both \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`capture\*(C'\fR will throw an exception, which if not caught will terminate your
program with an error.
.PP
Capturing the exception is easy:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    eval {
\&        run("cat *.txt");
\&    };
\&
\&    if ($@) {
\&        print "Something went wrong \- $@\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
See the diagnostics section below for more details.
.PP
\fIException cases\fR
.IX Subsection "Exception cases"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`IPC::System::Simple\*(C'\fR considers the following to be unexpected,
and worthy of exception:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Failing to start entirely (eg, command not found, permission denied).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Returning an exit value other than zero (but see below).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Being killed by a signal.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Being passed tainted data (in taint mode).
.SS "Exit values"
.IX Subsection "Exit values"
Traditionally, system commands return a zero status for success and a
non-zero status for failure.  \f(CW\*(C`IPC::System::Simple\*(C'\fR will default to throwing
an exception if a non-zero exit value is returned.
.PP
You may specify a range of values which are considered acceptable exit
values by passing an \fIarray reference\fR as the first argument.  The
special constant \f(CW\*(C`EXIT_ANY\*(C'\fR can be used to allow \fIany\fR exit value
to be returned.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use IPC::System::Simple qw(run system capture EXIT_ANY);
\&
\&        run( [0..5], "cat *.txt");             # Exit values 0\-5 are OK
\&
\&        system( [0..5], "cat *.txt");          # This works the same way
\&
\&        my @lines = capture( EXIT_ANY, "cat *.txt"); # Any exit is fine.
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR and replacement \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR subroutines returns the exit
value of the process:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        my $exit_value = run( [0..5], "cat *.txt");
\&
\&        # OR:
\&
\&        my $exit_value = system( [0..5] "cat *.txt");
\&
\&        print "Program exited with value $exit_value\en";
.Ve
.PP
\fI\f(CI$EXITVAL\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "$EXITVAL"
.PP
The exit value of any command executed by \f(CW\*(C`IPC::System::Simple\*(C'\fR
can always be retrieved from the \f(CW$IPC::System::Simple::EXITVAL\fR
variable:
.PP
This is particularly useful when inspecting results from \f(CW\*(C`capture\*(C'\fR,
which returns the captured text from the command.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture $EXITVAL EXIT_ANY);
\&
\&        my @enemies_defeated = capture(EXIT_ANY, "defeat_evil", "/dev/mordor");
\&
\&        print "Program exited with value $EXITVAL\en";
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW$EXITVAL\fR will be set to \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR if the command did not exit normally (eg,
being terminated by a signal) or did not start.  In this situation an
exception will also be thrown.
.SS "WINDOWS-SPECIFIC \s-1NOTES\s0"
.IX Subsection "WINDOWS-SPECIFIC NOTES"
As of \f(CW\*(C`IPC::System::Simple\*(C'\fR v0.06, the \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR subroutine \fIwhen
called with multiple arguments\fR will make available the full 32\-bit
exit value on Win32 systems.  This is different from the
previous versions of \f(CW\*(C`IPC::System::Simple\*(C'\fR and from Perl's
in-build \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR function, which can only handle 8\-bit return values.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`capture\*(C'\fR subroutine always returns the 32\-bit exit value under
Windows.  The \f(CW\*(C`capture\*(C'\fR subroutine also never uses the shell,
even when passed a single argument.
.PP
Versions of \f(CW\*(C`IPC::System::Simple\*(C'\fR before v0.09 would not search
the \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR environment variable when the multi-argument form of
\&\f(CW\*(C`run()\*(C'\fR was called.  Versions from v0.09 onwards correctly search
the path provided the command is provided including the extension
(eg, \f(CW\*(C`notepad.exe\*(C'\fR rather than just \f(CW\*(C`notepad\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`gvim.bat\*(C'\fR rather
than just \f(CW\*(C`gvim\*(C'\fR).  If no extension is provided, \f(CW\*(C`.exe\*(C'\fR is
assumed.
.PP
Signals are not supported on Windows systems.  Sending a signal
to a Windows process will usually cause it to exit with the signal
number used.

The \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`capture\*(C'\fR commands all set \f(CW$EXITVAL\fR,
making it easy to determine the exit status of a command.
Additionally, the \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR interfaces return the exit
status.
.IP "Consistent interfaces" 4
.IX Item "Consistent interfaces"
When called with multiple arguments, the \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`capture\*(C'\fR interfaces \fInever\fR invoke the shell.  This differs
from the in-built Perl \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR command which may invoke the
shell under Windows when called with multiple arguments.  It
differs from the in-built Perl backticks operator which always
invokes the shell.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
When \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR is exported, the exotic form \f(CW\*(C`system { $cmd } @args\*(C'\fR
is not supported.  Attemping to use the exotic form is a syntax
error.  This affects the calling package \fIonly\fR.  Use \f(CW\*(C`CORE::system\*(C'\fR
if you need it, or consider using the autodie module to replace
\&\f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR with lexical scope.
.PP
Core dumps are only checked for when a process dies due to a
signal.  It is not believed there are any systems where processes
can dump core without dying to a signal.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`WIFSTOPPED\*(C'\fR status is not checked, as perl never spawns processes
with the \f(CW\*(C`WUNTRACED\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
Signals are not supported under Win32 systems, since they don't
work at all like Unix signals.  Win32 signals cause commands to
exit with a given exit value, which this modules \fIdoes\fR capture.
.PP
Only 8\-bit values are returned when \f(CW\*(C`run()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR 
is called with a single value under Win32.  Multi-argument calls
to \f(CW\*(C`run()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR, as well as the \f(CW\*(C`runx()\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`systemx()\*(C'\fR always return the 32\-bit Windows return values.

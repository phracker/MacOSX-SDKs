This depends on Metal\&.framework  The softMax filter is a neural transfer function and is useful for classification tasks\&. The softMax filter is applied across feature channels and in a convolutional manner at all spatial locations\&. The softMax filter can be seen as the combination of an activation function (exponential) and a normalization operator\&. For each feature channel per pixel in an image in a feature map, the softMax filter computes the following: result channel in pixel = exp(pixel(x,y,k))/sum(exp(pixel(x,y,0)) \&.\&.\&. exp(pixel(x,y,N-1)) where N is the number of feature channels

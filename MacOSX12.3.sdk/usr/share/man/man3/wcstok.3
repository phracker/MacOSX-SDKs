.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wcstok
.Nd split wide-character string into tokens
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft wchar_t *
.Fo wcstok
.Fa "wchar_t *restrict ws1"
.Fa "const wchar_t *restrict ws2"
.Fa "wchar_t **restrict ptr"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcstok
function
is used to isolate sequential tokens in a null-terminated wide character
string,
.Fa ws1 .
These tokens are separated in the string by at least one of the
characters in
.Fa ws2 .
The first time that
.Fn wcstok
is called,
.Fa ws1
should be specified; subsequent calls, wishing to obtain further tokens
from the same string, should pass a null pointer instead.
The separator string,
.Fa ws2 ,
must be supplied each time, and may change between calls.
The context pointer,
.Fa ptr ,
must be provided on each call.
.Pp
The
.Fn wcstok
function is the wide character counterpart of the
.Fn strtok_r
function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn wcstok
function
returns a pointer to the beginning of each subsequent token in the string,
after replacing the token itself with a null wide character (L'\e0').
When no more tokens remain, a null pointer is returned.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment splits a wide character string on
.Tn ASCII
space, tab, and newline characters,
writing the resulting tokens to standard output:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
const wchar_t *seps = L" \et\en";
wchar_t *last, *tok, text[] = L" \enone\ettwo\et\etthree  \en";

for (tok = wcstok(text, seps, &last); tok != NULL;
    tok = wcstok(NULL, seps, &last))
	wprintf(L"%ls\en", tok);
.Ed
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Some early implementations of
.Fn wcstok
omit the
context pointer argument,
.Fa ptr ,
and maintain state across calls in a static variable like
.Fn strtok
does.

.Xr wcscspn 3 ,
.Xr wcspbrk 3 ,
.Xr wcsrchr 3 ,
.Xr wcsspn 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcstok
function
conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBApache::TestRequest\fR provides convenience functions to allow you to
make requests to your Apache test server in your test scripts. It
subclasses \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR, so that you have access to all if its
methods, but also exports a number of useful functions likely useful
for majority of your test requests. Users of the old \f(CW\*(C`Apache::test\*(C'\fR
(or \f(CW\*(C`Apache::testold\*(C'\fR) module, take note! Herein lie most of the
functions you'll need to use to replace \f(CW\*(C`Apache::test\*(C'\fR in your test
suites.
.PP
Each of the functions exported by \f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR uses an
\&\f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR object to submit the request and retrieve its
results. The return value for many of these functions is an
HTTP::Response object. See HTTP::Response for
documentation of its methods, which you can use in your tests. For
example, use the \f(CW\*(C`code()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`content()\*(C'\fR methods to test the
response code and content of your request. Using \f(CW\*(C`GET\*(C'\fR, you can
perform a couple of tests using these methods like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  use Apache::Test qw(ok have_lwp);
\&  use Apache::TestRequest qw(GET POST);
\&  use Apache::Constants qw(HTTP_OK);
\&
\&  plan tests => 2, have_lwp;
\&
\&  my $uri = "/test.html?foo=1&bar=2";
\&  my $res = GET $uri;
\&  ok $res\->code == HTTP_OK, "Check that the request was OK";
\&  ok $res\->content eq "foo => 1, bar => 2", "Check its content";
.Ve
.PP
Note that you can also use \f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR with
\&\f(CW\*(C`Test::Builder\*(C'\fR and its derivatives, including \f(CW\*(C`Test::More\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  use Test::More;
\&  # ...
\&  is $res\->code, HTTP_OK, "Check that the request was OK";
\&  is $res\->content, "foo => 1, bar => 2", "Check its content";
.Ve
.SH "CONFIGURATION FUNCTION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION FUNCTION"
You can tell \f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR what kind of \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR
object to use for its convenience functions with \f(CW\*(C`user_agent()\*(C'\fR. This
function uses its arguments to construct an internal global
\&\f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR object that will be used for all subsequent requests
made by the convenience functions. The arguments it takes are the same
as for the \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR constructor. See the
\&\f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR documentation for a complete list.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`user_agent()\*(C'\fR function only creates the internal
\&\f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR object the first time it is called. Since this
function is called internally by \f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR, you should
always use the \f(CW\*(C`reset\*(C'\fR parameter to force it to create a new global
\&\f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR Object:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  Apache::TestRequest::user_agent(reset => 1, %params);
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`user_agent()\*(C'\fR differs from \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\->new\*(C'\fR in two
additional ways. First, it supports an additional parameter,
\&\f(CW\*(C`keep_alive\*(C'\fR, which enables connection persistence, where the same
connection is used to process multiple requests (and, according to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR documentation, has the effect of
loading and enabling the new experimental \s-1HTTP/1.1\s0 protocol module).
.PP
And finally, the semantics of the \f(CW\*(C`requests_redirectable\*(C'\fR parameter is
different than for \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR in that you can pass it a boolean
value as well as an array for \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR. To force
\&\f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR not to follow redirects in any of its convenience
functions, pass a false value to \f(CW\*(C`requests_redirectable\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  Apache::TestRequest::user_agent(reset => 1,
\&                                  requests_redirectable => 0);
.Ve
.PP
If \s-1LWP\s0 is not installed, then you can still pass in an array reference
as \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR expects. \f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR will examine the
array and allow redirects if the array contains more than one value or
if there is only one value and that value is not \*(L"\s-1POST\*(R":\s0
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  # Always allow redirection.
\&  my $redir = have_lwp() ? [qw(GET HEAD POST)] : 1;
\&  Apache::TestRequest::user_agent(reset => 1,
\&                                  requests_redirectable => $redir);
.Ve
.PP
But note that redirection will \fBnot\fR work with \f(CW\*(C`POST\*(C'\fR unless \s-1LWP\s0 is
installed. It's best, therefore, to check \f(CW\*(C`have_lwp\*(C'\fR before running
tests that rely on a redirection from \f(CW\*(C`POST\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Sometimes it is desireable to have \f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR remember
cookies sent by the pages you are testing and send them back to the
server on subsequent requests. This is especially necessary when
testing pages whose functionality relies on sessions or the presence
of preferences stored in cookies.
.PP
By default, \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR does \fBnot\fR remember cookies between
requests. You can tell it to remember cookies between request by
adding:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  Apache::TestRequest::user_agent(cookie_jar => {});
.Ve
.PP
before issuing the requests.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR exports a number of functions that will likely
prove convenient for use in the majority of your request tests.
.SS "Optional Parameters"
.IX Subsection "Optional Parameters"
Each function also takes a number of optional arguments.
.IP "redirect_ok" 4
.IX Item "redirect_ok"
By default a request will follow redirects retrieved from the server. To
prevent this behavior, pass a false value to a \f(CW\*(C`redirect_ok\*(C'\fR
parameter:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my $res = GET $uri, redirect_ok => 0;
.Ve
.Sp
Alternately, if all of your tests need to disable redirects, tell
\&\f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR to use an \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR object that
disables redirects:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  Apache::TestRequest::user_agent( reset => 1,
\&                                   requests_redirectable => 0 );
.Ve
.IP "cert" 4
.IX Item "cert"
If you need to force an \s-1SSL\s0 request to use a particular \s-1SSL\s0
certificate, pass the name of the certificate via the \f(CW\*(C`cert\*(C'\fR
parameter:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my $res = GET $uri, cert => \*(Aqmy_cert\*(Aq;
.Ve
.IP "content" 4
.IX Item "content"
If you need to add content to your request, use the \f(CW\*(C`content\*(C'\fR
parameter:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my $res = GET $uri, content => \*(Aqhello world!\*(Aq;
.Ve
.IP "filename" 4
.IX Item "filename"
The name of a local file on the file system to be sent to the Apache
test server via \f(CW\*(C`UPLOAD()\*(C'\fR and its friends.

.PP
Sends a simple \s-1GET\s0 request to the Apache test server. Returns an
\&\f(CW\*(C`HTTP::Response\*(C'\fR object.
.PP
You can also supply additional headers to be sent with the request by
adding their name/value pairs after the \f(CW\*(C`url\*(C'\fR parameter, for example:
.PP
.Vb 1

to check, and you want to make sure that the request was successful
before comparing the contents of the request. If the request was
unsuccessful, \f(CW\*(C`GET_BODY_ASSERT\*(C'\fR will return an error

.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables can affect the behavior of
\&\f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR:
.IP "\s-1APACHE_TEST_PRETEND_NO_LWP\s0" 4
.IX Item "APACHE_TEST_PRETEND_NO_LWP"
If the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`APACHE_TEST_PRETEND_NO_LWP\*(C'\fR is set to a
true value, \f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR will pretend that \s-1LWP\s0 is not
available so one can test whether the test suite will survive on a
system which doesn't have libwww-perl installed.
.IP "\s-1APACHE_TEST_HTTP_09_OK\s0" 4
.IX Item "APACHE_TEST_HTTP_09_OK"
If the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`APACHE_TEST_HTTP_09_OK\*(C'\fR is set to a
true value, \f(CW\*(C`Apache::TestRequest\*(C'\fR will allow \s-1HTTP/0.9\s0 responses
from the server to proceed.  The default behavior is to die if
the response protocol is not either \s-1HTTP/1.0\s0 or \s-1HTTP/1.1.\s0

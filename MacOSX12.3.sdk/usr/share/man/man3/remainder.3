.Sh NAME
.Nm remainder
.Nd floating-point remainder function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn remainder "double x" "double y"
.Ft long double
.Fn remainderl "long double x" "long double y"
.Ft float
.Fn remainderf "float x" "float y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn remainder
functions compute the value r such that r = x - n*y, where n is the integer nearest the exact value of x/y.
.Pp
If there are two integers closest to x/y, n shall be the even one. If r is zero, it is given the same sign as x.
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn remainder "x, y"
returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception if x is infinite or y is 0.
.Sh NOTE
The
.Fn drem
function is deprecated.  Please use the C99 function
.Fn remainder
instead.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn remainder
functions to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vremainderf "vFloat x" "vFloat y" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvremainderf "float *z" "const float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvremainder "double *z" "const double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn remainder
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

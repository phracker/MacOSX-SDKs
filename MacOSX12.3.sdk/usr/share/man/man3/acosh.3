.Sh NAME
.Nm acosh
.Nd inverse hyperbolic cosine function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn acosh "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn acoshl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn acoshf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acosh
function computes the principle value of the inverse hyperbolic cosine of 
.Ar x .
The result is in the range
.Bq 0 , +infinity .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn acosh "1"
returns +0.
.Pp
.Fn acosh "x"
returns a NAN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception for x < 1.
.Pp
.Fn acosh "+infinity"
returns +infinity.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn acosh
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vacoshf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvacoshf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvacosh "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr atanh 3 ,
.Xr exp 3 ,
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn acosh
function conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn acosh
and
.Fn acoshf
function appeared in 
.Bx 4.3 .

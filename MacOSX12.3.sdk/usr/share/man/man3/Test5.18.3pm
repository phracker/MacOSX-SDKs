.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module simplifies the task of writing test files for Perl modules,
such that their output is in the format that
Test::Harness expects to see.
.SH "QUICK START GUIDE"
.IX Header "QUICK START GUIDE"
To write a test for your new (and probably not even done) module, create
a new file called \fIt/test.t\fR (in a new \fIt\fR directory). If you have
multiple test files, to test the \*(L"foo\*(R", \*(L"bar\*(R", and \*(L"baz\*(R" feature sets,
then feel free to call your files \fIt/foo.t\fR, \fIt/bar.t\fR, and
\&\fIt/baz.t\fR
.SS "Functions"
.IX Subsection "Functions"
This module defines three public functions, \f(CW\*(C`plan(...)\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ok(...)\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`skip(...)\*(C'\fR.  By default, all three are exported by
the \f(CW\*(C`use Test;\*(C'\fR statement.

Typical usage is just:

.RS 4
.Sp
You must call \f(CW\*(C`plan(...)\*(C'\fR once and only once.  You should call it
in a \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN {...}\*(C'\fR block, like so:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     BEGIN { plan tests => 23 }
.Ve
.RE
.ie n .IP """ok(...)""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWok(...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "ok(...)"
.Vb 3
\&  ok(1 + 1 == 2);
\&  ok($have, $expect);
\&  ok($have, $expect, $diagnostics);
.Ve
.Sp
This function is the reason for \f(CW\*(C`Test\*(C'\fR's existence.  It's
the basic function that
handles printing "\f(CW\*(C`ok\*(C'\fR\*(L" or \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`not ok\*(C'\fR", along with the
current test number.  (That's what \f(CW\*(C`Test::Harness\*(C'\fR wants to see.)
.Sp
In its most basic usage, \f(CW\*(C`ok(...)\*(C'\fR simply takes a single scalar
expression.  If its value is true, the test passes; if false,
the test fails.  Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    # Examples of ok(scalar)
\&
\&    ok( 1 + 1 == 2 );           # ok if 1 + 1 == 2
\&    ok( $foo =~ /bar/ );        # ok if $foo contains \*(Aqbar\*(Aq
\&    ok( baz($x + $y) eq \*(AqArmondo\*(Aq );    # ok if baz($x + $y) returns
\&                                        # \*(AqArmondo\*(Aq
\&    ok( @a == @b );             # ok if @a and @b are the same length
.Ve
.Sp
The expression is evaluated in scalar context.  So the following will
work:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    ok( @stuff );                       # ok if @stuff has any elements
\&    ok( !grep !defined $_, @stuff );    # ok if everything in @stuff is
\&                                        # defined.
.Ve
.Sp
A special case is if the expression is a subroutine reference (in either
\&\f(CW\*(C`sub {...}\*(C'\fR syntax or \f(CW\*(C`\e&foo\*(C'\fR syntax).  In
that case, it is executed and its value (true or false) determines if
the test passes or fails.  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    ok( sub {   # See whether sleep works at least passably
\&      my $start_time = time;
\&      sleep 5;
\&      time() \- $start_time  >= 4
\&    });
.Ve
.Sp
In its two-argument form, \f(CW\*(C`ok(\f(CIarg1\f(CW, \f(CIarg2\f(CW)\*(C'\fR compares the two
scalar values to see if they match.  They match if both are undefined,
or if \fIarg2\fR is a regex that matches \fIarg1\fR, or if they compare equal
with \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    # Example of ok(scalar, scalar)
\&
\&    ok( "this", "that" );               # not ok, \*(Aqthis\*(Aq ne \*(Aqthat\*(Aq
\&    ok( "", undef );                    # not ok, "" is defined
.Ve
.Sp
The second argument is considered a regex if it is either a regex
object or a string that looks like a regex.  Regex objects are
constructed with the qr// operator in recent versions of perl.  A
string is considered to look like a regex if its first and last
characters are \*(L"/\*(R", or if the first character is \*(L"m\*(R"
and its second and last characters are both the
same non-alphanumeric non-whitespace character.  These regexp
.Sp
Regex examples:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    ok( \*(AqJaffO\*(Aq, \*(Aq/Jaff/\*(Aq );    # ok, \*(AqJaffO\*(Aq =~ /Jaff/
\&    ok( \*(AqJaffO\*(Aq, \*(Aqm|Jaff|\*(Aq );   # ok, \*(AqJaffO\*(Aq =~ m|Jaff|
\&    ok( \*(AqJaffO\*(Aq, qr/Jaff/ );    # ok, \*(AqJaffO\*(Aq =~ qr/Jaff/;
\&    ok( \*(AqJaffO\*(Aq, \*(Aq/(?i)jaff/ ); # ok, \*(AqJaffO\*(Aq =~ /jaff/i;
.Ve
.Sp
If either (or both!) is a subroutine reference, it is run and used
as the value for comparing.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    ok sub {
\&        open(OUT, ">x.dat") || die $!;
\&        print OUT "\ex{e000}";
\&        close OUT;
\&        my $bytecount = \-s \*(Aqx.dat\*(Aq;
\&        unlink \*(Aqx.dat\*(Aq or warn "Can\*(Aqt unlink : $!";
\&        return $bytecount;
\&      },
\&      4
\&    ;
.Ve
.Sp
The above test passes two values to \f(CW\*(C`ok(arg1, arg2)\*(C'\fR \*(-- the first 
a coderef, and the second is the number 4.  Before \f(CW\*(C`ok\*(C'\fR compares them,
it calls the coderef, and uses its return value as the real value of
this parameter. Assuming that \f(CW$bytecount\fR returns 4, \f(CW\*(C`ok\*(C'\fR ends up
testing \f(CW\*(C`4 eq 4\*(C'\fR.  Since that's true, this test passes.
.Sp
Finally, you can append an optional third argument, in
\&\f(CW\*(C`ok(\f(CIarg1\f(CW,\f(CIarg2\f(CW, \f(CInote\f(CW)\*(C'\fR, where \fInote\fR is a string value that
will be printed if the test fails.  This should be some useful
information about the test, pertaining to why it failed, and/or
a description of the test.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    ok( grep($_ eq \*(Aqsomething unique\*(Aq, @stuff), 1,
\&        "Something that should be unique isn\*(Aqt!\en".
\&        \*(Aq@stuff = \*(Aq.join \*(Aq, \*(Aq, @stuff
\&      );
.Ve
.Sp
Unfortunately, a note cannot be used with the single argument
style of \f(CW\*(C`ok()\*(C'\fR.  That is, if you try \f(CW\*(C`ok(\f(CIarg1\f(CW, \f(CInote\f(CW)\*(C'\fR, then
\&\f(CW\*(C`Test\*(C'\fR will interpret this as \f(CW\*(C`ok(\f(CIarg1\f(CW, \f(CIarg2\f(CW)\*(C'\fR, and probably
end up testing \f(CW\*(C`\f(CIarg1\f(CW eq \f(CIarg2\f(CW\*(C'\fR \*(-- and that's not what you want!
.Sp
All of the above special cases can occasionally cause some
problems.  See \*(L"\s-1BUGS\s0 and \s-1CAVEATS\*(R"\s0.
.ie n .IP """skip(\f(CIskip_if_true\f(CW, \f(CIargs...\f(CW)""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWskip(\f(CIskip_if_true\f(CW, \f(CIargs...\f(CW)\fR" 4
.IX Item "skip(skip_if_true, args...)"
This is used for tests that under some conditions can be skipped.  It's
basically equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  if( $skip_if_true ) {
\&    ok(1);
\&  } else {
\&    ok( args... );
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
\&...except that the \f(CWok(1)\fR emits not just "\f(CW\*(C`ok \f(CItestnum\f(CW\*(C'\fR\*(L" but
actually \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`ok \f(CItestnum\f(CW # \f(CIskip_if_true_value\f(CW\*(C'\fR".
.Sp
The arguments after the \fIskip_if_true\fR are what is fed to \f(CW\*(C`ok(...)\*(C'\fR if
this test isn't skipped.
.Sp
Example usage:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  my $if_MSWin =
\&    $^O =~ m/MSWin/ ? \*(AqSkip if under MSWin\*(Aq : \*(Aq\*(Aq;
\&
\&  # A test to be skipped if under MSWin (i.e., run except under MSWin)
\&  skip($if_MSWin, thing($foo), thing($bar) );
.Ve
.Sp
Or, going the other way:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  my $unless_MSWin =
\&    $^O =~ m/MSWin/ ? \*(Aq\*(Aq : \*(AqSkip unless under MSWin\*(Aq;
\&
\&  # A test to be skipped unless under MSWin (i.e., run only under MSWin)
\&  skip($unless_MSWin, thing($foo), thing($bar) );
.Ve
.Sp
The tricky thing to remember is that the first parameter is true if
you want to \fIskip\fR the test, not \fIrun\fR it; and it also doubles as a
note about why it's being skipped. So in the first codeblock above, read
the code as "skip if MSWin \*(-- (otherwise) test whether \f(CW\*(C`thing($foo)\*(C'\fR is
\&\f(CW\*(C`thing($bar)\*(C'\fR\*(L" or for the second case, \*(R"skip unless MSWin...".
.Sp
Also, when your \fIskip_if_reason\fR string is true, it really should (for
backwards compatibility with older Test.pm versions) start with the
string \*(L"Skip\*(R", as shown in the above examples.
.Sp
Note that in the above cases, \f(CW\*(C`thing($foo)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`thing($bar)\*(C'\fR
\&\fIare\fR evaluated \*(-- but as long as the \f(CW\*(C`skip_if_true\*(C'\fR is true,
then we \f(CW\*(C`skip(...)\*(C'\fR just tosses out their value (i.e., not
bothering to treat them like values to \f(CW\*(C`ok(...)\*(C'\fR.  But if
you need to \fInot\fR eval the arguments when skipping the
test, use
this format:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  skip( $unless_MSWin,
\&    sub {
\&      # This code returns true if the test passes.
\&      # (But it doesn\*(Aqt even get called if the test is skipped.)
\&      thing($foo) eq thing($bar)
\&    }
\&  );
.Ve
.Sp
or even this, which is basically equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  skip( $unless_MSWin,
\&    sub { thing($foo) }, sub { thing($bar) }
\&  );
.Ve
.Sp
That is, both are like this:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  if( $unless_MSWin ) {
\&    ok(1);  # but it actually appends "# $unless_MSWin"
\&            #  so that Test::Harness can tell it\*(Aqs a skip
\&  } else {
\&    # Not skipping, so actually call and evaluate...
\&    ok( sub { thing($foo) }, sub { thing($bar) } );
\&  }

Although test failures should be enough, extra diagnostics can be
triggered at the end of a test run.  \f(CW\*(C`onfail\*(C'\fR is passed an array ref
of hash refs that describe each test failure.  Each hash will contain
at least the following fields: \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`repetition\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`result\*(C'\fR.  (You shouldn't rely on any other fields being present.)  If the test
had an expected value or a diagnostic (or \*(L"note\*(R") string, these will also be
included.
.PP
The \fIoptional\fR \f(CW\*(C`onfail\*(C'\fR hook might be used simply to print out the
version of your package and/or how to report problems.  It might also
be used to generate extremely sophisticated diagnostics for a
particularly bizarre test failure.  However it's not a panacea.  Core
dumps or other unrecoverable errors prevent the \f(CW\*(C`onfail\*(C'\fR hook from
running.  (It is run inside an \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR block.)  Besides, \f(CW\*(C`onfail\*(C'\fR is
probably over-kill in most cases.  (Your test code should be simpler

\&\f(CW\*(C`ok(...)\*(C'\fR's special handing of strings which look like they might be
regexes can also cause unexpected behavior.  An innocent:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ok( $fileglob, \*(Aq/path/to/some/*stuff/\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
will fail, since Test.pm considers the second argument to be a regex!
The best bet is to use the one-argument form:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ok( $fileglob eq \*(Aq/path/to/some/*stuff/\*(Aq );
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`ok(...)\*(C'\fR's use of string \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR can sometimes cause odd problems
when comparing
numbers, especially if you're casting a string to a number:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $foo = "1.0";
\&    ok( $foo, 1 );      # not ok, "1.0" ne 1
.Ve
.Sp
Your best bet is to use the single argument form:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ok( $foo == 1 );    # ok "1.0" == 1
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
As you may have inferred from the above documentation and examples,
\&\f(CW\*(C`ok\*(C'\fR's prototype is \f(CW\*(C`($;$$)\*(C'\fR (and, incidentally, \f(CW\*(C`skip\*(C'\fR's is
\&\f(CW\*(C`($;$$$)\*(C'\fR). This means, for example, that you can do \f(CW\*(C`ok @foo, @bar\*(C'\fR
to compare the \fIsize\fR of the two arrays. But don't be fooled into
thinking that \f(CW\*(C`ok @foo, @bar\*(C'\fR means a comparison of the contents of two
arrays \*(-- you're comparing \fIjust\fR the number of elements of each. It's
so easy to make that mistake in reading \f(CW\*(C`ok @foo, @bar\*(C'\fR that you might
want to be very explicit about it, and instead write \f(CW\*(C`ok scalar(@foo),
scalar(@bar)\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
This almost definitely doesn't do what you expect:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     ok $thingy\->can(\*(Aqsome_method\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
Why?  Because \f(CW\*(C`can\*(C'\fR returns a coderef to mean \*(L"yes it can (and the
method is this...)\*(R", and then \f(CW\*(C`ok\*(C'\fR sees a coderef and thinks you're
passing a function that you want it to call and consider the truth of
the result of!  I.e., just like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     ok $thingy\->can(\*(Aqsome_method\*(Aq)\->();
.Ve
.Sp
What you probably want instead is this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     ok $thingy\->can(\*(Aqsome_method\*(Aq) && 1;
.Ve
.Sp
If the \f(CW\*(C`can\*(C'\fR returns false, then that is passed to \f(CW\*(C`ok\*(C'\fR.  If it
returns true, then the larger expression \f(CW\*(C`$thingy\->can(\*(Aqsome_method\*(Aq)\ &&\ 1\*(C'\fR returns 1, which \f(CW\*(C`ok\*(C'\fR sees as
a simple signal of success, as you would expect.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The syntax for \f(CW\*(C`skip\*(C'\fR is about the only way it can be, but it's still
quite confusing.  Just start with the above examples and you'll
be okay.
.Sp
Moreover, users may expect this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  skip $unless_mswin, foo($bar), baz($quux);
.Ve
.Sp
to not evaluate \f(CW\*(C`foo($bar)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`baz($quux)\*(C'\fR when the test is being
skipped.  But in reality, they \fIare\fR evaluated, but \f(CW\*(C`skip\*(C'\fR just won't
bother comparing them if \f(CW$unless_mswin\fR is true.
.Sp
You could do this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  skip $unless_mswin, sub{foo($bar)}, sub{baz($quux)};
.Ve
.Sp
But that's not terribly pretty.  You may find it simpler or clearer in
the long run to just do things like this:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&  if( $^O =~ m/MSWin/ ) {
\&    print "# Yay, we\*(Aqre under $^O\en";
\&    ok foo($bar), baz($quux);
\&    ok thing($whatever), baz($stuff);
\&    ok blorp($quux, $whatever);
\&    ok foo($barzbarz), thang($quux);
\&  } else {
\&    print "# Feh, we\*(Aqre under $^O.  Watch me skip some tests...\en";
\&    for(1 .. 4) { skip "Skip unless under MSWin" }
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
But be quite sure that \f(CW\*(C`ok\*(C'\fR is called exactly as many times in the
first block as \f(CW\*(C`skip\*(C'\fR is called in the second block.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
If \f(CW\*(C`PERL_TEST_DIFF\*(C'\fR environment variable is set, it will be used as a
command for comparing unexpected multiline results.  If you have \s-1GNU\s0
diff installed, you might want to set \f(CW\*(C`PERL_TEST_DIFF\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`diff \-u\*(C'\fR.
If you don't have a suitable program, you might install the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Text::Diff\*(C'\fR module and then set \f(CW\*(C`PERL_TEST_DIFF\*(C'\fR to be \f(CW\*(C`perl
\&\-MText::Diff \-e \*(Aqprint diff(@ARGV)\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.  If \f(CW\*(C`PERL_TEST_DIFF\*(C'\fR isn't set
but the \f(CW\*(C`Algorithm::Diff\*(C'\fR module is available, then it will be used
to show the differences in multiline results.

.Sh NAME
.Nm floor
.Nd round to largest integral value not greater than x
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn floor "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn floorl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn floorf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn floor
functions return the largest integral value 
less than or equal to
.Fa x .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn floor "±0"
returns ±0.
.Pp
.Fn floor "±infinity"
returns ±infinity.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn floor
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vfloorf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvfloorf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvfloor "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ceil 3 ,
.Xr round 3 ,
.Xr trunc 3 ,
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn floor
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

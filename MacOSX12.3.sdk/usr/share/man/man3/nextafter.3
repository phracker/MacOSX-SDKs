.Sh NAME
.Nm nextafter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double 
.Fn nextafter "double x" "double y"
.Ft long double 
.Fn nextafterl "long double x" "long double y"
.Ft float
.Fn nextafterf "float x" "float y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn nextafter 
functions return the next machine representable number from 
.Fa x
in direction
.Fa y .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn nextafter "x" "y"
raises the "overflow" and "inexact" floating-point exceptions for x finite and the function value infinite.
.Pp
.Fn nextafter "x" "y"
raises the "underflow" and "inexact" floating-point exceptions for the function value subnormal or zero and x not equal to y.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn nextafter
functions to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vnextafterf "vFloat x" "vFloat y";
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvnextafterf "float *z" "const float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvnextafter "double *z" "const double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn nextafter
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

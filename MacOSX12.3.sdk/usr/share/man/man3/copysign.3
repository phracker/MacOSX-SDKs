.Sh NAME
.Nm copysign
.Nd changes the sign of x to that of y
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double 
.Fn copysign "double x" "double y"
.Ft long double 
.Fn copysignl "long double x" "long double y"
.Ft float
.Fn copysignf "float x" "float y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn copysign
functions return
.Fa x
with its sign changed to
.Fa y Ns 's.
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn copysign "x" "y"
returns a NaN (with y's sign) if x is a NaN.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn copysign
functions to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vcopysignf "vFloat x" "vFloat y";
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvcopysignf "float *z" "const float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvcopysign "double *z" "const double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn copysign
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

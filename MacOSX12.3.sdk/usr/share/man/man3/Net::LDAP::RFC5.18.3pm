.IX Subsection "RFC-4510 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4510.txt
.PP
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) is an Internet
protocol for accessing distributed directory services that act in
accordance with X.500 data and service models.  This document
provides a road map of the \s-1LDAP\s0 Technical Specification.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4511\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): The Protocol"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4511 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt
.PP
This document describes the protocol elements, along with their
semantics and encodings, of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0).  \s-1LDAP\s0 provides access to distributed directory services that
act in accordance with X.500 data and service models.  These protocol
elements are based on those described in the X.500 Directory Access
Protocol (\s-1DAP\s0).

.PP
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) is an Internet
protocol for accessing distributed directory services that act in
accordance with X.500 data and service models.  This document
describes the X.500 Directory Information Models, as used in \s-1LDAP.\s0
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4513\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): Authentication Methods and Security Mechanisms"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4513 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Authentication Methods and Security Mechanisms"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4513.txt
.PP
This document describes authentication methods and security
mechanisms of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0).  This
document details establishment of Transport Layer Security (\s-1TLS\s0)
using the StartTLS operation.
.PP
This document details the simple Bind authentication method including
anonymous, unauthenticated, and name/password mechanisms and the
Simple Authentication and Security Layer (\s-1SASL\s0) Bind authentication
method including the \s-1EXTERNAL\s0 mechanism.
.PP
This document discusses various authentication and authorization
states through which a session to an \s-1LDAP\s0 server may pass and the
actions that trigger these state changes.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4514\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): String Representation of Distinguished Names"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4514 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation of Distinguished Names"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt
.PP
The X.500 Directory uses distinguished names (DNs) as primary keys to
entries in the directory.  This document defines the string
representation used in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) to transfer distinguished names.  The string representation is
designed to give a clean representation of commonly used
distinguished names, while being able to represent any distinguished
name.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4515\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): String Representation of Search Filters"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4515 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation of Search Filters"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4515.txt
.PP
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) search filters are
transmitted in the \s-1LDAP\s0 protocol using a binary representation that
is appropriate for use on the network.  This document defines a
human-readable string representation of \s-1LDAP\s0 search filters that is
appropriate for use in \s-1LDAP\s0 URLs (\s-1RFC 4516\s0) and in other
applications.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4516\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): Uniform Resource Locator"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4516 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Uniform Resource Locator"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4516.txt
.PP
This document describes a format for a Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Uniform Resource Locator (\s-1URL\s0).  An \s-1LDAP URL\s0
describes an \s-1LDAP\s0 search operation that is used to retrieve
information from an \s-1LDAP\s0 directory, or, in the context of an \s-1LDAP\s0
referral or reference, an \s-1LDAP URL\s0 describes a service where an \s-1LDAP\s0
operation may be progressed.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4517\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): Syntaxes and Matching Rules"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4517 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Syntaxes and Matching Rules"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4517.txt
.PP
Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) directory, whose values may be transferred in the \s-1LDAP\s0
protocol, has a defined syntax that constrains the structure and
format of its values.  The comparison semantics for values of a
syntax are not part of the syntax definition but are instead provided
through separately defined matching rules.  Matching rules specify an
argument, an assertion value, which also has a defined syntax.  This
document defines a base set of syntaxes and matching rules for use in
defining attributes for \s-1LDAP\s0 directories.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4518\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): Internationalized String Preparation"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4518 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Internationalized String Preparation"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4518.txt
.PP
The previous Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) technical
specifications did not precisely define how character string matching
is to be performed.  This led to a number of usability and
interoperability problems.  This document defines string preparation
algorithms for character-based matching rules defined for use in
\&\s-1LDAP.\s0
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4519\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): Schema for User Applications"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4519 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Schema for User Applications"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4519.txt
.PP
This document is an integral part of the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) technical specification.  It provides a technical
specification of attribute types and object classes intended for use
by \s-1LDAP\s0 directory clients for many directory services, such as White
Pages.  These objects are widely used as a basis for the schema in
many \s-1LDAP\s0 directories.  This document does not cover attributes used
for the administration of directory servers, nor does it include
directory objects defined for specific uses in other documents.

.IX Subsection "RFC-6171 The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Don't Use Copy Control"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6171.txt
.PP
This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0)
Don't Use Copy control extension which allows a client to specify that
copied information should not be used in providing service.  This
control is based upon the X.511 dontUseCopy service control option.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-5020\s0 The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) entryDN Operational Attribute"
.IX Subsection "RFC-5020 The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) entryDN Operational Attribute"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5020.txt
.PP
This document describes the \s-1LDAP/X.500 \s0'entryDN' operational
attribute.  The attribute provides a copy of the entry's distinguished
name for use in attribute value assertions.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4792\s0 Encoding Instructions for the Generic String Encoding Rules (\s-1GSER\s0)"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4792 Encoding Instructions for the Generic String Encoding Rules (GSER)"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4792.txt
.PP
Abstract Syntax Notation One (\s-1ASN.1\s0) defines a general framework for
annotating types in an \s-1ASN.1\s0 specification with encoding instructions
that alter how values of those types are encoded according to \s-1ASN.1\s0
encoding rules.  This document defines the supporting notation for
encoding instructions that apply to the Generic String Encoding Rules
(\s-1GSER\s0), and in particular defines an encoding instruction to provide
a machine-processable representation for the declaration of a \s-1GSER\s0
ChoiceOfStrings type.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4532\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Who am I? Operation"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4532 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Who am I? Operation"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4532.txt
.PP
This specification provides a mechanism for Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) clients to obtain the authorization identity
the server has associated with the user or application entity.  This
mechanism is specified as an \s-1LDAP\s0 extended operation called the \s-1LDAP
\&\s0\*(L"Who am I?\*(R" operation.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4530\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) entryUUID Operational Attribute"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4530 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) entryUUID Operational Attribute"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4530.txt
.PP
This document describes the \s-1LDAP/X.500 \s0'entryUUID' operational
attribute and associated matching rules and syntax.  The attribute
holds a server-assigned Universally Unique Identifier (\s-1UUID\s0) for the
object.  Directory clients may use this attribute to distinguish
objects identified by a distinguished name or to locate an object
after renaming.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4528\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Assertion Control"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4528 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Assertion Control"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4528.txt
.PP
This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) Assertion Control, which allows a client to specify that a
directory operation should only be processed if an assertion applied
to the target entry of the operation is true.  It can be used to
construct \*(L"test and set\*(R", \*(L"test and clear\*(R", and other conditional
operations.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4527\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Read Entry Controls"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4527 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Read Entry Controls"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4527.txt
.PP
This document specifies an extension to the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) to allow the client to read the target entry
of an update operation.  The client may request to read the entry
before and/or after the modifications are applied.  These reads are
done as an atomic part of the update operation.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4526\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Absolute True and False Filters"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4526 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Absolute True and False Filters"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4526.txt
.PP
This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) to support absolute True and False filters based upon similar
capabilities found in X.500 directory systems.  The document also
extends the String Representation of \s-1LDAP\s0 Search Filters to support
these filters.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4524 COSINE LDAP/X.500\s0 Schema"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4524 COSINE LDAP/X.500 Schema"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4524.txt
.PP
This document provides a collection of schema elements for use with
the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) from the \s-1COSINE\s0 and
Internet X.500 pilot projects.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4523\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Schema Definitions for X.509 Certificates"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4523 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema Definitions for X.509 Certificates"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4523.txt
.PP
This document describes schema for representing X.509 certificates,
X.521 security information, and related elements in directories
accessible using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0).
The \s-1LDAP\s0 definitions for these X.509 and X.521 schema elements
replace those provided in RFCs 2252 and 2256.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4522\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): The Binary Encoding Option"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4522 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Binary Encoding Option"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4522.txt
.PP
Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) directory has a defined syntax (i.e., data type).  A syntax
definition specifies how attribute values conforming to the syntax
are normally represented when transferred in \s-1LDAP\s0 operations.  This
representation is referred to as the LDAP-specific encoding to
distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values.  This
document defines an attribute option, the binary option, that can be
used to specify that the associated attribute values are instead
encoded according to the Basic Encoding Rules (\s-1BER\s0) used by X.500
directories.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4370\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Proxied Authorization Control"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4370 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Proxied Authorization Control"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4370.txt
.PP
This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) Proxy Authorization Control.  The Proxy Authorization Control
allows a client to request that an operation be processed under a
provided authorization identity instead of under the current
authorization identity associated with the connection.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4104\s0 Policy Core Extension Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Schema (\s-1PCELS\s0)"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4104 Policy Core Extension Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Schema (PCELS)"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4104.txt
.PP
This document defines a number of changes and extensions to the
Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Schema (\s-1RFC
3703\s0) based on the model extensions defined by the Policy Core
Information Model (\s-1PCIM\s0) Extensions (\s-1RFC 3460\s0).  These changes and
extensions consist of new \s-1LDAP\s0 object classes and attribute types.
Some of the schema items defined in this document re-implement
existing concepts in accordance with their new semantics introduced
by \s-1RFC 3460. \s0 The other schema items implement new concepts, not
covered by \s-1RFC 3703. \s0 This document updates \s-1RFC 3703.\s0
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3928\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Client Update Protocol (\s-1LCUP\s0)"
.IX Subsection "RFC-3928 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Client Update Protocol (LCUP)"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3928.txt
.PP
This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) Client Update Protocol (\s-1LCUP\s0).  The protocol is intended to
allow an \s-1LDAP\s0 client to synchronize with the content of a directory
information tree (\s-1DIT\s0) stored by an \s-1LDAP\s0 server and to be notified
about the changes to that content.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3909\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Cancel Operation"
.IX Subsection "RFC-3909 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Cancel Operation"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3909.txt
.PP
This specification describes a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) extended operation to cancel (or abandon) an outstanding
operation.  Unlike the \s-1LDAP\s0 Abandon operation, but like the X.511
Directory Access Protocol (\s-1DAP\s0) Abandon operation, this operation has
a response which provides an indication of its outcome.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3876\s0 Returning Matched Values with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAPv3)"
.IX Subsection "RFC-3876 Returning Matched Values with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAPv3)"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3876.txt
.PP
This document describes a control for the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol version 3 that is used to return a subset of
attribute values from an entry.  Specifically, only those values that
match a \*(L"values return\*(R" filter.  Without support for this control, a
client must retrieve all of an attribute's values and search for
specific values locally.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3866\s0 Language Tags and Ranges in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0)"
.IX Subsection "RFC-3866 Language Tags and Ranges in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3866.txt
.PP
It is often desirable to be able to indicate the natural language
associated with values held in a directory and to be able to query
the directory for values which fulfill the user's language needs.
This document details the use of Language Tags and Ranges in the
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0).
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3727 ASN.1\s0 Module Definition for the \s-1LDAP\s0 and X.500 Component Matching Rules"
.IX Subsection "RFC-3727 ASN.1 Module Definition for the LDAP and X.500 Component Matching Rules"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3727.txt
.PP
This document updates the specification of the component matching
rules for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) and X.500
directories (\s-1RFC3687\s0) by collecting the Abstract Syntax Notation One
(\s-1ASN.1\s0) definitions of the component matching rules into an
appropriately identified \s-1ASN.1\s0 module so that other specifications
may reference the component matching rule definitions from within
their own \s-1ASN.1\s0 modules.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3703\s0 Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Schema"
.IX Subsection "RFC-3703 Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3703.txt
.PP
This document defines a mapping of the Policy Core Information Model
to a form that can be implemented in a directory that uses
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) as its access protocol.
This model defines two hierarchies of object classes: structural
classes representing information for representing and controlling
policy data as specified in \s-1RFC 3060,\s0 and relationship classes that
indicate how instances of the structural classes are related to each
other.  Classes are also added to the \s-1LDAP\s0 schema to improve the
performance of a client's interactions with an \s-1LDAP\s0 server when the
client is retrieving large amounts of policy-related information.
These classes exist only to optimize \s-1LDAP\s0 retrievals: there are no
classes in the information model that correspond to them.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3698\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): Additional Matching Rules"
.IX Subsection "RFC-3698 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Additional Matching Rules"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3698.txt
.PP
This document provides a collection of matching rules for use with
the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0).  As these matching
rules are simple adaptations of matching rules specified for use with
the X.500 Directory, most are already in wide use.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3687\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) and X.500 Component Matching Rules"
.IX Subsection "RFC-3687 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500 Component Matching Rules"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3687.txt
.PP
The syntaxes of attributes in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) or X.500 directory range from simple data types, such as text
string, integer, or Boolean, to complex structured data types, such
as the syntaxes of the directory schema operational attributes.
Matching rules defined for the complex syntaxes usually only provide
the most immediately useful matching capability.  This document
defines generic matching rules that can match any user selected
component parts in an attribute value of any arbitrarily complex
attribute syntax.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3672\s0 Subentries in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0)"

The integration of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0)

authentication identities and allowed for non-directory storage of
passwords.  As such, mechanisms which update the directory (e.g.,
Modify) cannot be used to change a user's password.  This document
describes an \s-1LDAP\s0 extended operation to allow modification of user
passwords which is not dependent upon the form of the authentication
identity nor the password storage mechanism used.

\&\s-1LDAP\s0 supports lightweight access to static directory services,
allowing relatively fast search and update access. Static
directory services store information about people that persists

directory services are different in that they store information
about people that only persists in its accuracy and value while
people are online. Though the protocol operations and
attributes used by dynamic directory services are similar to
the ones used for static directory services, clients that are
bound to a dynamic directory service need to periodically
refresh their presence at the server to keep directory entries
from getting stale in the presence of client application
crashes. A flow control mechanism from the server is also
described that allows a server to inform clients how often they

This document describes a procedure for mapping between Service
Location Protocol (\s-1SLP\s0) service advertisements and lightweight
directory access protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) descriptions of services.  The
document covers two aspects of the mapping.  One aspect is mapping
between \s-1SLP\s0 service type templates and \s-1LDAP\s0 directory schema.
Because the \s-1SLP\s0 service type template grammar is relatively simple,
mapping from service type templates to \s-1LDAP\s0 types is straightforward.
Mapping in the other direction is straightforward if the attributes
are restricted to use just a few of the syntaxes defined in \s-1RFC 2252.\s0
If arbitrary \s-1ASN.1\s0 types occur in the schema, then the mapping is
more complex and may even be impossible.  The second aspect is
representation of service information in an \s-1LDAP\s0 directory.  The
recommended representation simplifies interoperability with \s-1SLP\s0 by
allowing \s-1SLP\s0 directory agents to backend into \s-1LDAP\s0 directory servers.

.IX Subsection "RFC-5805 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Transactions"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5805.txt
.PP
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) update operations, such
as Add, Delete, and Modify operations, have atomic, consistency,
isolation, durability (\s-1ACID\s0) properties.  Each of these update
operations act upon an entry.  It is often desirable to update two or
more entries in a single unit of interaction, a transaction.
Transactions are necessary to support a number of applications
including resource provisioning.  This document extends \s-1LDAP\s0 to
support transactions.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4533\s0 The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Content Synchronization Operation"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4533 The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Content Synchronization Operation"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4533.txt
.PP
This specification describes the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Content Synchronization Operation.  The operation
allows a client to maintain a copy of a fragment of the Directory
Information Tree (\s-1DIT\s0).  It supports both polling for changes and
listening for changes.  The operation is defined as an extension of
the \s-1LDAP\s0 Search Operation.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-4531\s0 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) Turn Operation"
.IX Subsection "RFC-4531 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Turn Operation"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4531.txt
.PP
This specification describes a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) extended operation to reverse (or \*(L"turn\*(R") the roles of client
and server for subsequent protocol exchanges in the session, or to
enable each peer to act as both client and server with respect to the
other.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3663\s0 Domain Administrative Data in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0)"
.IX Subsection "RFC-3663 Domain Administrative Data in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3663.txt
.PP
Domain registration data has typically been exposed to the general
public via Nicname/Whois for administrative purposes.  This document
describes the Referral Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0)
Service, an experimental service using \s-1LDAP\s0 and well-known \s-1LDAP\s0 types
to make domain administrative data available.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-3088\s0 OpenLDAP Root Service \- An experimental \s-1LDAP\s0 referral service"
.IX Subsection "RFC-3088 OpenLDAP Root Service - An experimental LDAP referral service"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3088.txt
.PP
The OpenLDAP Project is operating an experimental \s-1LDAP \s0(Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol) referral service known as the \*(L"OpenLDAP
Root Service\*(R".  The automated system generates referrals based upon
service location information published in \s-1DNS SRV\s0 RRs (Domain Name
System location of services resource records).  This document
describes this service.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-2657\s0 LDAPv2 Client vs. the Index Mesh"
.IX Subsection "RFC-2657 LDAPv2 Client vs. the Index Mesh"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2657.txt
.PP
LDAPv2 clients as implemented according to \s-1RFC 1777\s0 have no
notion of referral. The integration between such a client and
an Index Mesh, as defined by the Common Indexing Protocol,
heavily depends on referrals and therefore needs to be handled
in a special way. This document defines one possible way of
doing this.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-2649\s0 Signed Directory Operations Using S/MIME"
.IX Subsection "RFC-2649 Signed Directory Operations Using S/MIME"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2649.txt
.PP
This document defines an LDAPv3 based mechanism for signing
directory operations in order to create a secure journal of
changes that have been made to each directory entry. Both
client and server based signatures are supported. An object
class for subsequent retrieval are 'journal entries' is also
defined. This document specifies LDAPv3 controls that enable
this functionality. It also defines an LDAPv3 schema that
allows for subsequent browsing of the journal information.
.SS "\s-1RFC\-2307\s0 An Approach for Using \s-1LDAP\s0 as a Network Information Service"
.IX Subsection "RFC-2307 An Approach for Using LDAP as a Network Information Service"
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt
.PP
This document describes an experimental mechanism for mapping
entities related to \s-1TCP/IP\s0 and the \s-1UNIX\s0 system into X.500
entries so that they may be resolved with the \s-1LDAP. A\s0 set of
attribute types and object classes are proposed, along with
specific guidelines for interpreting them. The intention is to
assist the deployment of \s-1LDAP\s0 as an organizational nameservice.
No proposed solutions are intended as standards for the
Internet. Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will
emerge as to the appropriate solution to such problems, leading
eventually to the adoption of standards. The proposed mechanism
has already been implemented with some success.

.SS "draft-wahl-ldap-adminaddr \*(-- Administrator Address Attribute"
.IX Subsection "draft-wahl-ldap-adminaddr Administrator Address Attribute"
Organizations running multiple directory servers need an
ability for administrators to determine who is responsible for
a particular server. This is conceptually similar to the
\&'sysContact' object of \s-1SNMP.\s0 The administratorsAddress
attribute allows a server administrator to provide the contact
information of the responsible party for an \s-1LDAP\s0 server. This
can be used by management clients which are, for example,
checking the state of a replication or referral topology, to
provide a way for the user of the management client to send
email to manager of a particular server.
.SS "draft-zeilenga-ldap-noop \*(-- The \s-1LDAP\s0 No-Op Control"
.IX Subsection "draft-zeilenga-ldap-noop The LDAP No-Op Control"
This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0)
No-Op control which can be used to disable the normal effect of an
operation.  The control can be used to discover how a server might
react to a particular update request without updating the directory.
.SS "draft-legg-ldap-transfer \*(-- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0): Transfer Encoding Options"
.IX Subsection "draft-legg-ldap-transfer Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Transfer Encoding Options"
Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(\s-1LDAP\s0) directory has a defined syntax (i.e., data type).  A syntax
definition specifies how attribute values conforming to the syntax
are normally represented when transferred in \s-1LDAP\s0 operations.  This
representation is referred to as the LDAP-specific encoding to
distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values.  This
document introduces a new category of attribute options, called
transfer encoding options, that can be used to specify that the
associated attribute values are encoded according to one of these
other methods.
.SS "draft-furuseth-ldap-untypedobject \*(-- Structural object class 'namedObject' for \s-1LDAP/X.500\s0"
.IX Subsection "draft-furuseth-ldap-untypedobject Structural object class 'namedObject' for LDAP/X.500"
This document defines an 'namedObject' structural object class for
the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) and X.500.  This is
useful for entries with no natural choice of structural object class,
e.g. if an entry must exist even though its contents are
uninteresting.
.SS "draft\-wahl\-ldap\-p3p \*(-- P3P Policy Attributes for \s-1LDAP\s0"
.IX Subsection "draft-wahl-ldap-p3p P3P Policy Attributes for LDAP"
This document defines attributes that can be retrieved via
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (\s-1LDAP\s0) requests,
which contain URIs pointing to the privacy policy documents.  These
documents describe the privacy policy concerning access to a
directory server, and the privacy policies that apply to the contents
of the directory (a subtree of entries).
.SS "draft-chu-ldap-xordered \*(-- Ordered Entries and Values in \s-1LDAP\s0"
.IX Subsection "draft-chu-ldap-xordered Ordered Entries and Values in LDAP"
As \s-1LDAP\s0 is used more extensively for managing various kinds of data,
one often encounters a need to preserve both the ordering and the
content of data, despite the inherently unordered structure of
entries and attribute values in the directory.  This document
describes a scheme to attach ordering information to attributes in a
directory so that the ordering may be preserved and propagated to
other \s-1LDAP\s0 applications.
.SS "draft-chu-ldap-logschema \*(-- A Schema for Logging the \s-1LDAP\s0 Protocol"
.IX Subsection "draft-chu-ldap-logschema A Schema for Logging the LDAP Protocol"
In order to facilitate remote administration and auditing of \s-1LDAP\s0
server operation, it is desirable to provide the server's operational
logs themselves as a searchable \s-1LDAP\s0 directory.  These logs may also
be used as a persistent change log to support various replication
mechanisms.  This document defines a schema that may be used to
represent all of the requests that have been processed by an \s-1LDAP\s0
server.  It may be used by various applications for auditing, flight
recorder, replication, and other purposes.
.SS "draft-zeilenga-ldap-relax \*(-- The \s-1LDAP\s0 Relax Rules Control"
.IX Subsection "draft-zeilenga-ldap-relax The LDAP Relax Rules Control"
This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0)
Relax Rules Control which allows a directory user agent (a client) to
request the directory service temporarily relax enforcement of various
data and service model rules.
.SS "draft-gpaterno-dhcp-ldap \*(-- \s-1DHCP\s0 Option for \s-1LDAP\s0 Directory Services discovery"
.IX Subsection "draft-gpaterno-dhcp-ldap DHCP Option for LDAP Directory Services discovery"
This document defines a new \s-1DHCP\s0 option for delivering configuration
information for \s-1LDAP\s0 services. Through this option, the client
receives an \s-1LDAP URL\s0 [8] of the closest available \s-1LDAP\s0 server/replica
that can be used to authenticate users or look up any useful data.
.SS "draft-schleiff-ldap-xri \*(-- \s-1LDAP\s0 Schema for eXtensible Resource Identifier (\s-1XRI\s0)"
.IX Subsection "draft-schleiff-ldap-xri LDAP Schema for eXtensible Resource Identifier (XRI)"
This document describes Attribute Types and an Object Class for use
in representing \s-1XRI \s0(eXtensible Resource Identifier) values in \s-1LDAP
\&\s0(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and X.500 directory services.
.SS "draft-wahl-ldap-session \*(-- \s-1LDAP\s0 Session Tracking Control"
.IX Subsection "draft-wahl-ldap-session LDAP Session Tracking Control"
Many network devices, application servers, and middleware components
of a enterprise software infrastructure generate some form of session
tracking identifiers, which are useful when analyzing activity and
accounting logs to group activity relating to a particular session.
This document discusses how Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
version 3 (\s-1LDAP\s0) clients can include session tracking identifiers
with their \s-1LDAP\s0 requests.  This information is provided through
controls in the requests the clients send to \s-1LDAP\s0 servers.  The \s-1LDAP\s0
server receiving these controls can include the session tracking
identifiers the log messages it writes, enabling \s-1LDAP\s0 requests in
the \s-1LDAP\s0 server's logs to be correlated with activity in logs of
other components in the infrastructure.  The control also enables
session tracking information to be generated by \s-1LDAP\s0 servers and
returned to clients and other servers.  Three formats of session
tracking identifiers are defined in this document.
.SS "draft-wahl-ldap-subtree-source \*(-- \s-1LDAP\s0 Subtree Data Source \s-1URI\s0 Attribute"
.IX Subsection "draft-wahl-ldap-subtree-source LDAP Subtree Data Source URI Attribute"
This document defines an attribute that enables administrative
clients using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\s-1LDAP\s0) to
determine the source of directory entries.
.SS "draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch \*(-- Persistent Search: A Simple \s-1LDAP\s0 Change Notification Mechanism"
.IX Subsection "draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch Persistent Search: A Simple LDAP Change Notification Mechanism"
This document defines two controls that extend the LDAPv3
search operation to provide a simple mechanism by which an \s-1LDAP\s0
client can receive notification of changes that occur in an
\&\s-1LDAP\s0 server. The mechanism is designed to be very flexible yet
easy for clients and servers to implement.
.SS "draft\-ietf\-ldapext\-ldapv3\-vlv \*(-- \s-1LDAP\s0 Extensions for Scrolling View Browsing of Search Results"
.IX Subsection "draft-ietf-ldapext-ldapv3-vlv LDAP Extensions for Scrolling View Browsing of Search Results"
This document describes a Virtual List View control  extension  for  the
\&\s-1LDAP \s0 Search  operation.  This control is designed to allow the \*(L"virtual
list box\*(R" feature, common in existing  commercial  e\-mail  address  book
applications, to be supported efficiently by \s-1LDAP\s0 servers. \s-1LDAP\s0 servers'
inability to support this client feature is a significant impediment  to
\&\s-1LDAP\s0 replacing proprietary protocols in commercial e\-mail systems.
.PP
The control allows a client to specify that the  server  return,  for  a
given  \s-1LDAP\s0 search with associated sort keys, a contiguous subset of the
search result set. This subset is specified in terms of offsets into the
ordered list, or in terms of a greater than or equal comparison value.

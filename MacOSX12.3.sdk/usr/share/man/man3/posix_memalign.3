.Dt POSIX_MEMALIGN 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm posix_memalign
.Nd aligned memory allocation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft int
.Fo posix_memalign
.Fa "void **memptr"
.Fa "size_t alignment"
.Fa "size_t size"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function allocates
.Fa size
bytes of memory such that the allocation's base address is an exact multiple of
.Fa alignment ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.Fa memptr .
.Pp
The requested
.Fa alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.Fn sizeof "void *" .
.Pp
Memory that is allocated via
.Fn posix_memalign
can be used as an argument in subsequent calls to
.Xr realloc 3 ,
.Xr reallocf 3 ,
and
.Xr free 3 .
(Note however, that the allocation returned by
.Xr realloc 3 
or
.Xr reallocf 3 
is not guaranteed to preserve the original
.Fa alignment ) .
.Sh NOTES
.Fn posix_memalign
should be used judiciously as the algorithm that realizes the
.Fa alignment
constraint can incur significant memory overhead.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise it returns an error value.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa alignment
parameter is not a power of 2 at least as large as
.Fn sizeof "void *" .
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Memory allocation error.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr free 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr realloc 3 ,
.Xr reallocf 3 ,
.Xr valloc 3 ,
.Xr malloc_zone_memalign 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .

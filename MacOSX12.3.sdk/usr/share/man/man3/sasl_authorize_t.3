.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B sasl_authorize_t
is used to check whether the authorized user
.I auth_identity
may act as the user
.I requested_user.
For example the user root may wish to authenticate with his
credentials but act as the user tmartin (with all of tmartin's rights
not roots). A server application should be very careful, and probably
err on the side of caution, when determining which users may proxy as
whom.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
SASL callback functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for a complete list. SASL_OK indicates success.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn xpc_main
function is called by an XPC service to initialize the runtime and start
listening for incoming connections.
.Sh HANDLER
The
.Fa handler
provided to
.Fn xpc_main
will be invoked when a new connection has been established with the service.
For each new connection, an
.Ft xpc_connection_t
will be passed as the parameter to the
.Fa handler .
Each connection corresponds to a call to
.Xr xpc_connection_create 3
made by a client of the service.
.Pp
The service is responsible for setting an event handler on the new connection
and resuming it in the same fashion as new connections returned by
.Xr xpc_connection_create 3 .
.Pp
.Em Important :
The new connection passed to
.Fn handler
must be retained using
.Xr xpc_retain 3
if it will be stored in data structures that persist beyond the scope of that
function.

.Sh RUNTIME MANAGEMENT
The XPC runtime automatically keeps track of message activity to determine
whether a service is busy or idle. If the service remains idle after a period
of inactivity (defined by the system),
.Fn xpc_main
will exit the process. This behavior is automatically enabled for XPC services,
but
.Xr launchd 8
jobs wishing to opt into the same behavior may do so by adding the
EnablePressuredExit key to their
.Xr launchd.plist 5 .
.Pp
Activity is tracked with a transaction count maintained by the XPC runtime.
A service is deemed idle when its transaction count is zero.
The transaction count is incremented immediately before the receipt and
delivery of a message to a peer connection's event handler. The transaction
count is correspondingly decremented when the event handler returns.
.Pp
The transaction count is also incremented when a reply message is created with
.Xr xpc_dictionary_create_reply 3 ,
and decremented when the reply is sent. As a result, a service with outstanding
reply messages is not considered idle.
.Pp
Services may extend the default behavior using
.Fn xpc_transaction_begin
and
.Fn xpc_transaction_end ,
which increment and decrement the transaction count respectively. This may be
necessary for services that send periodic messages to their clients, not in
direct reply to a received message.
.Pp
Beginning a transaction and never ending it is considered an anti-pattern and is
strongly discouraged.
.Pp
If the service has a non-zero transaction count at a time when the system deems
it necessary to terminate the service, peer connections in the service may
receive the
.Ft XPC_ERROR_TERMINATION_IMMINENT
event. This event indicates that the service should unwind all outstanding work
as quickly as possible and not begin any new work, as the system will terminate
the process if it does not exit in a timely fashion. After this event is
received, no further messages will be delivered to the peers, and the end of the
service's last outstanding transaction will automatically terminate the process.
.Pp
The XPC runtime will also automatically manage the service's priority based on
where a message came from. If an app sends a message to the service, the
act of sending that message will boost the destination service's priority and
resource limits so that it can more quickly fill the request. If, however, a
service gets a message from a background process, the service stays at a lower
priority so as not to interfere with work initiated as a direct result of user
interaction.
.Pp
The lifetime of these boosts is tied to the lifetime of the message or reply
object, just like transactions. So while the service maintains a reference to
a message which boosted it, the boost will remain. If a reply message is
created using
.Xr xpc_dictionary_create_reply 3 ,
the boost transfers to the reply object and will remain with the process until
until the reply has been sent or deallocated.
.Pp
Note that boosts happen as a result of a message-send operation. So even if the
service isn't running when a boosting message is sent, it will be launched
on-demand at the elevated priority necessary to receive the message in a timely
fashion.
.Pp
launchd jobs which use XPC for their IPC may opt into priority boosting by
specifying their ProcessType as Adaptive. This will apply priority boosting
behavior only to the MachServices that are in the launchd.plist. See
.Xr launchd.plist 5
for more details.
.Sh DEFAULT ENVIRONMENT
The execution environment for XPC services bundled with applications is tightly
controlled. By default, services are executed in a new security audit session
and therefore do not have access to the current user's keychain or the ability
to draw UI.
This behavior may be overridden with the
.Ft JoinExistingSession
key in the service's
.Pa Info.plist .
.Pp
By default, the
.Fn xpc_main
function will call the 
.Xr dispatch_main 3
function to manage the service's main event loop.
This behavior may be overridden with the
.Ft RunLoopType
key in the service's
.Pa Info.plist .
.Pp
See 
.Xr xpcservice.plist 5
for more information about these keys.

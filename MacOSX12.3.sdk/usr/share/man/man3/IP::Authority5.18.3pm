.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Historically, the former InterNIC  managed (under the auspices of \s-1IANA\s0)
the allocation of \s-1IP\s0 numbers to ISPs and other organizations. This changed
somewhat when the Regional Internet Registry system was started, with the
creation of three (and later, four) Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)
around the world, each managing the allocation of \s-1IP\s0 addresses to 
organizations within differing physical areas (see also \s-1RFC2050\s0).
.PP
This means that there is no central whois database for \s-1IP\s0 numbers.
.PP
This module allows the user to lookup the \s-1RIR\s0 who has authority for a 
particular \s-1IP\s0 address. After finding out the authority for an \s-1IP\s0 address,
it is possible to use the authority's whois server to lookup the netblock owner.
.SH "CONSTRUCTOR"

The constructor takes no arguments.

Using the module in a procedural fashion (without the arrow syntax) won't work.
.ie n .IP "$auth = $reg\->inet_atoauth(\s-1HOSTNAME\s0)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$auth\fR = \f(CW$reg\fR\->inet_atoauth(\s-1HOSTNAME\s0)" 4
.IX Item "$auth = $reg->inet_atoauth(HOSTNAME)"
Takes a string giving the name of a host, and translates that to an
two-letter string representing the regional Internet registry that has authority
of that \s-1IP\s0 address:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  AR = ARIN (North America)
\&  RI = RIPE (Europe)
\&  LA = LACNIC (Latin America)
\&  AP = APNIC (Asia\-Pacific)
\&  AF = AFRINIC (Africa and Indian Ocean)
\&  IA = IANA (see RFC3330)
.Ve
.Sp
Takes arguments of both the 'rtfm.mit.edu' type and '18.181.0.24'. If the 
host name cannot be resolved, returns undef. If the resolved \s-1IP\s0 address is not 
contained within the database, returns undef. For multi-homed hosts (hosts 
with more than one address), the first address found is returned.
.ie n .IP "$auth = $reg\->inet_ntoauth(\s-1IP_ADDRESS\s0)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$auth\fR = \f(CW$reg\fR\->inet_ntoauth(\s-1IP_ADDRESS\s0)" 4
.IX Item "$auth = $reg->inet_ntoauth(IP_ADDRESS)"
Takes a string (an opaque string as returned by \fISocket::inet_aton()\fR) 
and translates it into a two-letter string representing the regional Internet 
registry that has authority of that \s-1IP\s0 address:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  AR = ARIN (North America)
\&  RI = RIPE (Europe)
\&  LA = LACNIC (Latin America)
\&  AP = APNIC (Asia\-Pacific)
\&  AF = AFRINIC (Africa and Indian Ocean)
\&  IA = IANA (see RFC3330)
.Ve
.Sp
If the \s-1IP\s0 address is not contained within the database, returns undef.
.ie n .IP "$t = $reg\->\fIdb_time()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$t\fR = \f(CW$reg\fR\->\fIdb_time()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$t = $reg->db_time()"
Returns the creation date of the database, measured as number of seconds 
since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 \s-1GMT,\s0 January 1, 1970). Suitable for feeding 
to \*(L"gmtime\*(R" and \*(L"localtime\*(R".

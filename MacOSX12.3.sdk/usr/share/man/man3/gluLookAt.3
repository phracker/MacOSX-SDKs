.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2eyeX\fP\ \f2eyeY\fP\ \f2eyeZ\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2eyeX\fP, \f2eyeY\fP, \f2eyeZ\fP
Specifies the position of the eye point.
.TP
\f2centerX\fP, \f2centerY\fP, \f2centerZ\fP
Specifies the position of the reference point.
.TP
\f2upX\fP, \f2upY\fP, \f2upZ\fP
Specifies the direction of the \f2up\fP vector.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluLookAt\fP creates a viewing matrix derived from an eye point, a reference
point indicating the center of the scene, and an \f2UP\fP vector.  
.P
The matrix
maps the reference point to the negative \f2z\fP axis and the
eye point to the origin.
When a typical projection matrix is used,
the center of the scene therefore maps to the center of the viewport.
Similarly, the direction described by the \f2UP\fP
vector projected onto the viewing plane is mapped to the positive \f2y\fP 
axis so that it points upward in the viewport.
The \f2UP\fP vector must not be parallel to the line of sight from the
eye point to the reference point.
.P
Let 

.Bd -literal
     centerX - eyeX
 F = centerY - eyeY
     centerZ - eyeZ
.Ed

Let \f2UP\fP be the vector (upX, upY, upZ). 
.P
Then normalize as follows: f = F/ || F ||

UP' = UP/|| UP ||

Finally, let s = f X UP', and u = s X f.

M is then constructed as follows:

.Bd -literal
      s[0]    s[1]    s[2]    0
      u[0]    u[1]    u[2]    0
 M = -f[0]   -f[1]   -f[2]    0
       0       0       0      1
.Ed

and \%\f3gluLookAt\fP is equivalent to 

glMultMatrixf(M);

glTranslated (-eyeX, -eyeY, -eyeZ);

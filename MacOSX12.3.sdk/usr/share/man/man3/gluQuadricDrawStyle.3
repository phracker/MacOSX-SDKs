.SH NAME
.B "gluQuadricDrawStyle
\- specify the draw style desired for quadrics

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3gluQuadricDrawStyle\fP(
GLUquadric* \fIquad\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3void \fPgluQuadricDrawStyle( 'u
	GLenum \fIdraw\fP )
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2quad\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2quad\fP
Specifies the quadrics object (created with \%\f3gluNewQuadric\fP).
.TP
\f2draw\fP
Specifies the desired draw style. Valid values are
\%\f3GLU_FILL\fP,
\%\f3GLU_LINE\fP,
\%\f3GLU_SILHOUETTE\fP, and
\%\f3GLU_POINT\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluQuadricDrawStyle\fP specifies the draw style for quadrics rendered with
\f2quad\fP. The legal values are as follows:
.TP 15
\%\f3GLU_FILL\fP
Quadrics are rendered with polygon primitives. The polygons 
are drawn in a counterclockwise fashion with respect to their
normals (as defined with \%\f3gluQuadricOrientation\fP).
.TP
\%\f3GLU_LINE\fP
Quadrics are rendered as a set of lines.
.TP
\%\f3GLU_SILHOUETTE\fP
Quadrics are rendered as a set of lines, except that edges separating
coplanar faces will not be drawn.
.TP
\%\f3GLU_POINT\fP
Quadrics are rendered as a set of points.

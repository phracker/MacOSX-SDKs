.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is an \s-1SQL\s0 to \s-1OO\s0 mapper with an object \s-1API\s0 inspired by Class::DBI
(with a compatibility layer as a springboard for porting) and a resultset \s-1API\s0
that allows abstract encapsulation of database operations. It aims to make
representing queries in your code as perl-ish as possible while still
providing access to as many of the capabilities of the database as possible,
including retrieving related records from multiple tables in a single query,
\&\f(CW\*(C`JOIN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`LEFT JOIN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`COUNT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`DISTINCT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`GROUP BY\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ORDER BY\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`HAVING\*(C'\fR support.
.PP
DBIx::Class can handle multi-column primary and foreign keys, complex
queries and database-level paging, and does its best to only query the
database in order to return something you've directly asked for. If a
resultset is used as an iterator it only fetches rows off the statement
handle as requested in order to minimise memory usage. It has auto-increment
support for SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, \s-1SQL\s0 Server and \s-1DB2\s0 and is
known to be used in production on at least the first four, and is fork\-
and thread-safe out of the box (although
your \s-1DBD\s0 may not be).
.PP
This project is still under rapid development, so large new features may be
marked \fBexperimental\fR \- such APIs are still usable but may have edge bugs.
Failing test cases are \fIalways\fR welcome and point releases are put out rapidly
as bugs are found and fixed.
.PP
We do our best to maintain full backwards compatibility for published
APIs, since DBIx::Class is used in production in many organisations,
and even backwards incompatible changes to non-published APIs will be fixed
if they're reported and doing so doesn't cost the codebase anything.
.PP
The test suite is quite substantial, and several developer releases
are generally made to \s-1CPAN\s0 before the branch for the next release is
merged back to trunk for a major release.

Contributions are always welcome, in all usable forms (we especially
welcome documentation improvements). The delivery methods include git\-
or unified-diff formatted patches, GitHub pull requests, or plain bug
reports either via \s-1RT\s0 or the Mailing list. Do not hesitate to
get in touch with any further questions you may
have.

Even though a large portion of the source \fIappears\fR to be written by just a
handful of people, this library continues to remain a collaborative effort \-
perhaps one of the most successful such projects on \s-1CPAN\s0 <http://cpan.org>.
It is important to remember that ideas do not always result in a direct code
contribution, but deserve acknowledgement just the same. Time and time again
the seemingly most insignificant questions and suggestions have been shown
to catalyze monumental improvements in consistency, accuracy and performance.

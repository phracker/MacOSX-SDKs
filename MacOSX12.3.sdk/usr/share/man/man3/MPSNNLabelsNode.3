.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The labels and weights for each \fBMPSImage\fP are passed in separately to the graph in a MPSNNLabels object\&. If the batch interface is used then there will be a MPSStateBatch of these of the same size as the MPSImageBatch that holds the images\&. The \fBMPSNNLabelsNode\fP is a place holder in the graph for these nodes\&. The MPSNNLabels node is taken as an input to the Loss node

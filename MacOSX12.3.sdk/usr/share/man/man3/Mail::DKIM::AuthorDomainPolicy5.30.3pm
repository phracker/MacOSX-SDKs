.SH "NAME"
Mail::DKIM::AuthorDomainPolicy \- represents an Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP) record
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Author Domain Signing Policies (\s-1ADSP\s0) record can be published by any
domain to help a receiver know what to do when it encounters an unsigned
message claiming to originate from that domain.
.PP
The record is published as a \s-1DNS TXT\s0 record at _adsp._domainkey.DOMAIN
where \s-1DOMAIN\s0 is the domain of the message's \*(L"From\*(R" address.
.PP
More details about this record can be found by reading the specification
itself at <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5617>.
.SH "CONSTRUCTORS"
.IX Header "CONSTRUCTORS"
.SS "\fBfetch()\fP"
.IX Subsection "fetch()"
Lookup an \s-1ADSP\s0 record in \s-1DNS.\s0
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  my $policy = Mail::DKIM::AuthorDomainPolicy\->fetch(
\&            Protocol => \*(Aqdns\*(Aq,
\&            Author => \*(Aqjsmith@example.org\*(Aq,
\&          );
.Ve
.PP
If the \s-1ADSP\s0 record is found and appears to be valid, an object
containing that record's information will be constructed and returned.
If the \s-1ADSP\s0 record is blank or simply does not exist, an object
representing the default policy will be returned instead.
(See also \*(L"\fBis_implied_default_policy()\fR\*(R".)
If a \s-1DNS\s0 error occurs (e.g. \s-1SERVFAIL\s0 or time-out), this method
will \*(L"die\*(R".
.SS "\fBnew()\fP"
.IX Subsection "new()"
Construct a default policy object.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $policy = Mail::DKIM::AuthorDomainPolicy\->new;
.Ve
.SS "\fBparse()\fP"
.IX Subsection "parse()"
Construct an \s-1ADSP\s0 record from a string.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  my $policy = Mail::DKIM::AuthorDomainPolicy\->parse(
\&          String => \*(Aqdkim=all\*(Aq,
\&          Domain => \*(Aqaaa.example\*(Aq,
\&      );
.Ve
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS "\fBapply()\fP"
.IX Subsection "apply()"
Apply the policy to the results of a \s-1DKIM\s0 verifier.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $result = $policy\->apply($dkim_verifier);
.Ve
.PP
The caller must provide an instance of Mail::DKIM::Verifier, one which
has already been fed the message being verified.
.PP
Possible results are:
.IP "accept" 4
.IX Item "accept"
The message is approved by the sender signing policy.
.IP "reject" 4
.IX Item "reject"
The message is rejected by the sender signing policy.
It can be considered very suspicious.
.IP "neutral" 4
.IX Item "neutral"
The message is neither approved nor rejected by the sender signing
policy. It can be considered somewhat suspicious.
.PP
Note: in the future, these values may become:
 none \- no \s-1ADSP\s0 record is published
 pass \- a passing signature is present
 fail \- \s-1ADSP\s0 record is \*(L"all\*(R" and no passing signature is found
 discard \- \s-1ADSP\s0 record is \*(L"discardable\*(R" and no passing signature is found
 nxdomain \- the \s-1DNS\s0 domain does not exist
 temperror \- transient error occurred
 permerror \- non-transient error occurred
.SS "\fBis_implied_default_policy()\fP"
.IX Subsection "is_implied_default_policy()"
Tells whether this policy implied.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $is_implied = $policy\->is_implied_default_policy;
.Ve
.PP
If you fetch the policy for a particular domain, but that domain
does not have a policy published, then the \*(L"default policy\*(R" is
in effect. Use this method to detect when that happens.
.SS "\fBlocation()\fP"
.IX Subsection "location()"
Tells where the policy was fetched from.
.PP
If the policy is domain-wide, this will be domain where the policy was
published.
.PP
If the policy is user-specific, \s-1TBD.\s0
.PP
If nothing is published for the domain, and the default policy
was returned instead, the location will be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.SS "\fBpolicy()\fP"
.IX Subsection "policy()"
Get or set the outbound signing policy (dkim=) tag.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $sp = $policy\->policy;
.Ve
.PP
Outbound signing policy for the entity. Possible values are:
.ie n .IP """unknown""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWunknown\fR" 4
.IX Item "unknown"
The default. The entity may sign some or all email.
.ie n .IP """all""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWall\fR" 4
.IX Item "all"
All mail from the domain is expected to be signed, using a valid Author
signature, but the author does not suggest discarding mail without a
valid signature.
.ie n .IP """discardable""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWdiscardable\fR" 4
.IX Item "discardable"
All mail from the domain is expected to be signed, using a valid Author
signature, and the author is so confident that non-signed mail claiming
to be from this domain can be automatically discarded by the recipient's
mail server.
.ie n .IP """NXDOMAIN""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW``NXDOMAIN''\fR" 4
.IX Item """NXDOMAIN"""
The domain is out of scope, i.e., the domain does not exist in the
\&\s-1DNS.\s0
.SS "\fBsignall()\fP"
.IX Subsection "signall()"
True if policy is \*(L"all\*(R".
.SS "\fBsignall_discardable()\fP"
.IX Subsection "signall_discardable()"
True if policy is \*(L"strict\*(R".
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Section 4.3 of the specification says to perform a query on the
domain itself just to see if it exists. This class is not
currently doing that, i.e. it might report \s-1NXDOMAIN\s0 because
_adsp._domainkey.example.org is nonexistent, but it should
not be treated the same as example.org being nonexistent.

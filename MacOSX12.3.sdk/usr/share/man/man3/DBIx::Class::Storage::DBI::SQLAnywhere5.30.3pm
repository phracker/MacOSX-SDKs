.SH "NAME"
DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLAnywhere \- Driver for SQL Anywhere
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This class implements autoincrements for \s-1SQL\s0 Anywhere and provides
DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime support and support for the
\&\f(CW\*(C`uniqueidentifier\*(C'\fR type (via
DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLAnywhere::Cursor.)
.PP
You need the \f(CW\*(C`DBD::SQLAnywhere\*(C'\fR driver that comes with the \s-1SQL\s0 Anywhere
distribution, \fB\s-1NOT\s0\fR the one on \s-1CPAN.\s0 It is usually under a path such as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  /opt/sqlanywhere11/sdk/perl
.Ve
.PP
Recommended connect_info settings:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  on_connect_call => \*(Aqdatetime_setup\*(Aq
.Ve
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS "connect_call_datetime_setup"
.IX Subsection "connect_call_datetime_setup"
Used as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    on_connect_call => \*(Aqdatetime_setup\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
In connect_info to set the date and
timestamp formats (as temporary options for the session) for use with
DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`TIMESTAMP\*(C'\fR data type supports up to 6 digits after the decimal point for
second precision. The full precision is used.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`DATE\*(C'\fR data type supposedly stores hours and minutes too, according to the
documentation, but I could not get that to work. It seems to only store the
date.
.PP
You will need the DateTime::Format::Strptime module for inflation to work.
.SH "MAXIMUM CURSORS"
.IX Header "MAXIMUM CURSORS"
A DBIx::Class application can use a lot of cursors, due to the usage of
prepare_cached.
.PP
The default cursor maximum is \f(CW50\fR, which can be a bit too low. This limit can
be turned off (or increased) by the \s-1DBA\s0 by executing:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  set option max_statement_count = 0
\&  set option max_cursor_count    = 0
.Ve
.PP
Highly recommended.

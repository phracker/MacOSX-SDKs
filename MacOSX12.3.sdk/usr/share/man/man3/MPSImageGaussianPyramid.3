.PP 
The Gaussian image pyramid is constructed as follows: First the zeroth level mipmap of the input image is filtered with the specified convolution kernel\&. The default the convolution filter kernel is 
.PP
.nf
k = w w^T, where w = [ 1/16,  1/4,  3/8,  1/4,  1/16 ]^T,

.fi
.PP
 but the user may also tweak this kernel with a \fBcenterWeight\fP parameter: 'a': 
.PP
.nf
k = w w^T, where w = [ (1/4 - a/2),  1/4,  a,  1/4,  (1/4 - a/2) ]^T

.fi
.PP
 or the user can provide a completely custom kernel\&. After this the image is downsampled by removing all odd rows and columns, which defines the next level in the Gaussian image pyramid\&. This procedure is continued until every mipmap level present in the image texture are filled with the pyramid levels\&.
.PP
In case of the Gaussian pyramid the user must run the operation in-place using: \fBinPlaceTexture:fallbackCopyAllocator:\fP, where the fallback allocator is ignored\&.

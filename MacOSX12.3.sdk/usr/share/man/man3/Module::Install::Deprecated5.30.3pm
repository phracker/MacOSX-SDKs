.SH "NAME"
Module::Install::Deprecated \- Warnings and help for deprecated commands
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
One of the nicest features of Module::Install is that as it improves,
there is no need to take into account user compatibility, because users do
not need to install Module::Install itself.
.PP
As a result, the Module::Install \s-1API\s0 changes at a faster rate than usual,
and this results in deprecated commands.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Module::Install::Deprecated\*(C'\fR provides implementations of the deprecated
commands, so that when an author is upgrading their Module::Install and
they are using a deprecated command they will be told that the command has
been deprecated, and what the author should use instead.
.PP
This extension should \s-1NEVER\s0 end up bundled into the distribution tarball.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.SS "c_files"
.IX Subsection "c_files"
The \f(CW\*(C`c_files\*(C'\fR command has been changed to \f(CW\*(C`cc_files\*(C'\fR to reduce confusion
and keep all compiler commands within a consistent \f(CW\*(C`ff_foo\*(C'\fR naming scheme.
.SS "inc_paths"
.IX Subsection "inc_paths"
The \f(CW\*(C`inc_paths\*(C'\fR command has been changed to \f(CW\*(C`cc_inc_paths\*(C'\fR due to
confusion between Perl and C.
.SS "lib_paths"
.IX Subsection "lib_paths"
The \f(CW\*(C`lib_paths\*(C'\fR command has been changed to \f(CW\*(C`cc_lib_paths\*(C'\fR due to confusion
between Perl and C.
.SS "lib_links"
.IX Subsection "lib_links"
The \f(CW\*(C`lib_links\*(C'\fR command has been changed to \f(CW\*(C`cc_lib_links\*(C'\fR due to confusion
between Perl and C.
.SS "optimize_flags"
.IX Subsection "optimize_flags"
The \f(CW\*(C`optimize_flags\*(C'\fR command has been changed to \f(CW\*(C`cc_optimize_flags\*(C'\fR for
consistency reasons.

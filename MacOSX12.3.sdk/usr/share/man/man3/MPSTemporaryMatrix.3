Help MPS decide which allocations to make ahead of time  The buffer cache that underlies the \fBMPSTemporaryMatrix\fP can automatically allocate new storage as needed as you create new temporary matrices\&. However, sometimes a more global view of what you plan to make is useful for maximizing memory reuse to get the most efficient operation\&. This class method hints to the cache what the list of matrices will be\&.
.PP
It is never necessary to call this method\&. It is purely a performance and memory optimization\&.

\fIcommandBuffer\fP The MTLCommandBuffer on which the \fBMPSTemporaryMatrix\fP will be exclusively used

\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
\fBA\fP valid \fBMPSTemporaryMatrix\fP\&. The object is not managed by a NSAutoreleasePool\&. The object will be released when the command buffer is committed\&. The underlying buffer will become invalid before this time due to the action of the readCount property\&. Please read and understand the use of the readCount property before using this object\&.

.SS "\- (NSUInteger) readCount\fC [read]\fP, \fC [write]\fP, \fC [nonatomic]\fP, \fC [assign]\fP"
The number of times a temporary matrix may be read by a \fBMPSMatrix\fP\&.\&.\&. kernel before its contents become undefined\&.
.PP
MPSTemporaryMatrices must release their underlying buffers for reuse immediately after last use\&. So as to facilitate \fIprompt\fP convenient memory recycling, each time a \fBMPSTemporaryMatrix\fP is read by a \fBMPSMatrix\fP\&.\&.\&. -encode\&.\&.\&. method, its readCount is automatically decremented\&. When the readCount reaches 0, the underlying buffer is automatically made available for reuse to MPS for its own needs and for other MPSTemporaryMatrices prior to return from the -encode\&.\&. function\&. The contents of the buffer become undefined at this time\&.
.PP
By default, the readCount is initialized to 1, indicating a matrix that may be overwritten any number of times, but read only once\&.
.PP
You may change the readCount as desired to allow MPSMatrixKernels to read the \fBMPSTemporaryMatrix\fP additional times\&. However, it is an error to change the readCount once it is zero\&. It is an error to read or write to a \fBMPSTemporaryMatrix\fP with a zero readCount\&. You may set the readCount to 0 yourself to cause the underlying buffer to be returned to MPS\&. Writing to a \fBMPSTemporaryMatrix\fP does not adjust the readCount\&.
.PP
The Metal API Validation layer will assert if a \fBMPSTemporaryMatrix\fP is deallocated with non-zero readCount to help identify cases when resources are not returned promptly\&.

.Sh NAME
.Nm asinh
.Nd inverse hyperbolic sine function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn asinh "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn asinhl "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn asinhf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn asinh
function computes the inverse hyperbolic sine
of the real
argument
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn asinh "±0"
returns ±0.
.Pp
.Fn asinh "±infinity"
returns ±infinity.
.Sh VECTOR OPERATIONS
If you need to apply the 
.Fn asinh
function to SIMD vectors or arrays, using the following functions provided
by the Accelerate.framework may give significantly better performance:
.Pp
.Fd #include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
.Pp
.Ft vFloat
.Fn vasinhf "vFloat x" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvasinhf "float *y" "const float *x" "const int *n" ;
.br
.Ft void
.Fn vvasinh "double *y" "const double *x" "const int *n" ;
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr atanh 3 ,
.Xr exp 3 ,
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn asinh
function conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

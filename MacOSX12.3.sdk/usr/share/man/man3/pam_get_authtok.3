.Ft "int"
.Fn pam_get_authtok "pam_handle_t *pamh" "int item" "const char **authtok" "const char *prompt"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function returns the cached authentication token,
or prompts the user if no token is currently cached.
Either way, a pointer to the authentication token is stored in the

when changing authentication tokens.
.It Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK
Returns the previous authentication token when changing
authentication tokens.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa prompt
argument specifies a prompt to use if no token is cached.
If it is
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK_PROMPT
or
.Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK_PROMPT
item,
as appropriate, will be used.
If that item is also
.Dv NULL ,
a hardcoded default prompt will be used.
.Pp
If
.Fa item
is set to
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK
and there is a non-null
.Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK
item,
.Nm
will ask the user to confirm the new token by
retyping it.
If there is a mismatch,
.Nm
will return
.Dv PAM_TRY_AGAIN .

.SH "STATUS"

This module is covered by the
Type-Tiny stability policy.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This documents the details of the Types::Standard type library.
Type::Tiny::Manual is a better starting place if you're new.
.PP
Type::Tiny bundles a few types which seem to be useful.
.SS "Moose-like"
.IX Subsection "Moose-like"
The following types are similar to those described in
Moose::Util::TypeConstraints.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBAny\fR
.Sp
Absolutely any value passes this type constraint (even undef).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBItem\fR
.Sp
Essentially the same as \fBAny\fR. All other type constraints in this library
inherit directly or indirectly from \fBItem\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBBool\fR
.Sp
Values that are reasonable booleans. Accepts 1, 0, the empty string and
undef.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBMaybe[`a]\fR
.Sp
Given another type constraint, also accepts undef. For example,
\&\fBMaybe[Int]\fR accepts all integers plus undef.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBUndef\fR
.Sp
Only undef passes this type constraint.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBDefined\fR
.Sp
Only undef fails this type constraint.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBValue\fR
.Sp
Any defined, non-reference value.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBStr\fR
.Sp
Any string.
.Sp
(The only difference between \fBValue\fR and \fBStr\fR is that the former accepts
typeglobs and vstrings.)
.Sp
Other customers also bought: \fBStringLike\fR from Types::TypeTiny.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBNum\fR
.Sp
See \fBLaxNum\fR and \fBStrictNum\fR below.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBInt\fR
.Sp
An integer; that is a string of digits 0 to 9, optionally prefixed with a
hyphen-minus character.
.Sp
Expect inconsistent results for dualvars, and numbers too high (or negative
numbers too low) for Perl to safely represent as an integer.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBClassName\fR
.Sp
The name of a loaded package. The package must have \f(CW@ISA\fR or
\&\f(CW$VERSION\fR defined, or must define at least one sub to be considered
a loaded package.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBRoleName\fR
.Sp
Like \fBClassName\fR, but the package must \fInot\fR define a method called
\&\f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR. This is subtly different from Moose's type constraint of the same
name; let me know if this causes you any problems. (I can't promise I'll
change anything though.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBRef[`a]\fR
.Sp
Any defined reference value, including blessed objects.
.Sp
Unlike Moose, \fBRef\fR is a parameterized type, allowing Scalar::Util::reftype
checks, a la
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Ref["HASH"]  # hashrefs, including blessed hashrefs
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBScalarRef[`a]\fR
.Sp
A value where \f(CW\*(C`ref($value) eq "SCALAR" or ref($value) eq "REF"\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If parameterized, the referred value must pass the additional constraint.
For example, \fBScalarRef[Int]\fR must be a reference to a scalar which
holds an integer value.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBArrayRef[`a]\fR
.Sp
A value where \f(CW\*(C`ref($value) eq "ARRAY"\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If parameterized, the elements of the array must pass the additional
constraint. For example, \fBArrayRef[Num]\fR must be a reference to an
array of numbers.
.Sp
As an extension to Moose's \fBArrayRef\fR type, a minimum and maximum array
length can be given:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   ArrayRef[CodeRef, 1]        # ArrayRef of at least one CodeRef
\&   ArrayRef[FileHandle, 0, 2]  # ArrayRef of up to two FileHandles
\&   ArrayRef[Any, 0, 100]       # ArrayRef of up to 100 elements
.Ve
.Sp
Other customers also bought: \fBArrayLike\fR from Types::TypeTiny.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBHashRef[`a]\fR
.Sp
A value where \f(CW\*(C`ref($value) eq "HASH"\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If parameterized, the values of the hash must pass the additional
constraint. For example, \fBHashRef[Num]\fR must be a reference to an
hash where the values are numbers. The hash keys are not constrained,
but Perl limits them to strings; see \fBMap\fR below if you need to further
constrain the hash values.
.Sp
Other customers also bought: \fBHashLike\fR from Types::TypeTiny.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBCodeRef\fR
.Sp
A value where \f(CW\*(C`ref($value) eq "CODE"\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Other customers also bought: \fBCodeLike\fR from Types::TypeTiny.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBRegexpRef\fR
.Sp
A reference where \f(CW\*(C`re::is_regexp($value)\*(C'\fR is true, or
a blessed reference where \f(CW\*(C`$value\->isa("Regexp")\*(C'\fR is true.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBGlobRef\fR
.Sp
A value where \f(CW\*(C`ref($value) eq "GLOB"\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBFileHandle\fR
.Sp
A file handle.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBObject\fR
.Sp
A blessed object.
.Sp
(This also accepts regexp refs.)
.SS "Structured"
.IX Subsection "Structured"
\&\s-1OK,\s0 so I stole some ideas from MooseX::Types::Structured.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBMap[`k, `v]\fR
.Sp
Similar to \fBHashRef\fR but parameterized with type constraints for both the
key and value. The constraint for keys would typically be a subtype of
\&\fBStr\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBTuple[...]\fR
.Sp
Subtype of \fBArrayRef\fR, accepting a list of type constraints for
each slot in the array.
.Sp
\&\fBTuple[Int, HashRef]\fR would match \f(CW\*(C`[1, {}]\*(C'\fR but not \f(CW\*(C`[{}, 1]\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBDict[...]\fR
.Sp
Subtype of \fBHashRef\fR, accepting a list of type constraints for
each slot in the hash.
.Sp
For example \fBDict[name => Str, id => Int]\fR allows
\&\f(CW\*(C`{ name => "Bob", id => 42 }\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBOptional[`a]\fR
.Sp
Used in conjunction with \fBDict\fR and \fBTuple\fR to specify slots that are
optional and may be omitted (but not necessarily set to an explicit undef).
.Sp
\&\fBDict[name => Str, id => Optional[Int]]\fR allows \f(CW\*(C`{ name => "Bob" }\*(C'\fR
but not \f(CW\*(C`{ name => "Bob", id => "BOB" }\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Note that any use of \fBOptional[`a]\fR outside the context of
parameterized \fBDict\fR and \fBTuple\fR type constraints makes little sense,
and its behaviour is undefined. (An exception: it is used by
Type::Params for a similar purpose to how it's used in \fBTuple\fR.)
.PP
This module also exports a \f(CW\*(C`slurpy\*(C'\fR function, which can be used as
follows.
.PP
It can cause additional trailing values in a \fBTuple\fR to be slurped
into a structure and validated. For example, slurping into an arrayref:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   my $type = Tuple[Str, slurpy ArrayRef[Int]];
\&   
\&   $type\->( ["Hello"] );                # ok
\&   $type\->( ["Hello", 1, 2, 3] );       # ok
\&   $type\->( ["Hello", [1, 2, 3]] );     # not ok
.Ve
.PP
Or into a hashref:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   my $type2 = Tuple[Str, slurpy Map[Int, RegexpRef]];
\&   
\&   $type2\->( ["Hello"] );                               # ok
\&   $type2\->( ["Hello", 1, qr/one/i, 2, qr/two/] );      # ok
.Ve
.PP
It can cause additional values in a \fBDict\fR to be slurped into a
hashref and validated:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   my $type3 = Dict[ values => ArrayRef, slurpy HashRef[Str] ];
\&   
\&   $type3\->( { values => [] } );                        # ok
\&   $type3\->( { values => [], name => "Foo" } );         # ok
\&   $type3\->( { values => [], name => [] } );            # not ok
.Ve
.PP
In either \fBTuple\fR or \fBDict\fR, \fBslurpy Any\fR can be used to indicate
that additional values are acceptable, but should not be constrained in
any way.
.PP
\&\fBslurpy Any\fR is an optimized code path. Although the following are
essentially equivalent checks, the former should run a lot faster:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   Tuple[Int, slurpy Any]
\&   Tuple[Int, slurpy ArrayRef]
.Ve
.SS "Objects"
.IX Subsection "Objects"
\&\s-1OK,\s0 so I stole some ideas from MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBInstanceOf[`a]\fR
.Sp
Shortcut for a union of Type::Tiny::Class constraints.
.Sp
\&\fBInstanceOf[\*(L"Foo\*(R", \*(L"Bar\*(R"]\fR allows objects blessed into the \f(CW\*(C`Foo\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`Bar\*(C'\fR classes, or subclasses of those.
.Sp
Given no parameters, just equivalent to \fBObject\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBConsumerOf[`a]\fR
.Sp
Shortcut for an intersection of Type::Tiny::Role constraints.
.Sp
\&\fBConsumerOf[\*(L"Foo\*(R", \*(L"Bar\*(R"]\fR allows objects where \f(CW\*(C`$o\->DOES("Foo")\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`$o\->DOES("Bar")\*(C'\fR both return true.
.Sp
Given no parameters, just equivalent to \fBObject\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBHasMethods[`a]\fR
.Sp
Shortcut for a Type::Tiny::Duck constraint.
.Sp
\&\fBHasMethods[\*(L"foo\*(R", \*(L"bar\*(R"]\fR allows objects where \f(CW\*(C`$o\->can("foo")\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`$o\->can("bar")\*(C'\fR both return true.
.Sp
Given no parameters, just equivalent to \fBObject\fR.
.SS "More"
.IX Subsection "More"
There are a few other types exported by this module:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBOverload[`a]\fR
.Sp
With no parameters, checks that the value is an overloaded object. Can
be given one or more string parameters, which are specific operations
to check are overloaded. For example, the following checks for objects
which overload addition and subtraction.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Overload["+", "\-"]
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBTied[`a]\fR
.Sp
A reference to a tied scalar, array or hash.
.Sp
Can be parameterized with a type constraint which will be applied to
the object returned by the \f(CW\*(C`tied()\*(C'\fR function. As a convenience,
can also be parameterized with a string, which will be inflated to a
Type::Tiny::Class.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   use Types::Standard qw(Tied);
\&   use Type::Utils qw(class_type);
\&   
\&   my $My_Package = class_type { class => "My::Package" };
\&   
\&   tie my %h, "My::Package";
\&   \e%h ~~ Tied;                   # true
\&   \e%h ~~ Tied[ $My_Package ];    # true
\&   \e%h ~~ Tied["My::Package"];    # true
\&   
\&   tie my $s, "Other::Package";
\&   \e$s ~~ Tied;                   # true
\&   $s  ~~ Tied;                   # false !!
.Ve
.Sp
If you need to check that something is specifically a reference to
a tied hash, use an intersection:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   use Types::Standard qw( Tied HashRef );
\&   
\&   my $TiedHash = (Tied) & (HashRef);
\&   
\&   tie my %h, "My::Package";
\&   tie my $s, "Other::Package";
\&   
\&   \e%h ~~ $TiedHash;     # true
\&   \e$s ~~ $TiedHash;     # false
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBStrMatch[`a]\fR
.Sp
A string that matches a regular expression:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   declare "Distance",
\&      as StrMatch[ qr{^([0\-9]+)\es*(mm|cm|m|km)$} ];
.Ve
.Sp
You can optionally provide a type constraint for the array of subexpressions:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&   declare "Distance",
\&      as StrMatch[
\&         qr{^([0\-9]+)\es*(.+)$},
\&         Tuple[
\&            Int,
\&            enum(DistanceUnit => [qw/ mm cm m km /]),
\&         ],
\&      ];
.Ve
.Sp
Here's an example using Regexp::Common:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&   package Local::Host {
\&      use Moose;
\&      use Regexp::Common;
\&      has ip_address => (
\&         is         => \*(Aqro\*(Aq,
\&         required   => 1,
\&         isa        => StrMatch[/^$RE{net}{IPv4}$/],
\&         default    => \*(Aq127.0.0.1\*(Aq,
\&      );
\&   }
.Ve
.Sp
On certain versions of Perl, type constraints of the forms
\&\fBStrMatch[qr/../\fR and \fBStrMatch[qr/\eA..\ez/\fR with any number
of intervening dots can be optimized to simple length checks.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBEnum[`a]\fR
.Sp
As per MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&   has size => (
\&      is     => "ro",
\&      isa    => Enum[qw( S M L XL XXL )],
\&   );
.Ve
.Sp
You can enable coercion by passing \f(CW\*(C`\e1\*(C'\fR before the list of values.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&   has size => (
\&      is     => "ro",
\&      isa    => Enum[ \e1, qw( S M L XL XXL ) ],
\&      coerce => 1,
\&   );
.Ve
.Sp
This will use the \f(CW\*(C`closest_match\*(C'\fR method in Type::Tiny::Enum to
coerce closely matching strings.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBOptList\fR
.Sp
An arrayref of arrayrefs in the style of Data::OptList output.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBLaxNum\fR, \fBStrictNum\fR
.Sp
In Moose 2.09, the \fBNum\fR type constraint implementation was changed from
being a wrapper around Scalar::Util's \f(CW\*(C`looks_like_number\*(C'\fR function to
a stricter regexp (which disallows things like \*(L"\-Inf\*(R" and \*(L"Nan\*(R").
.Sp
Types::Standard provides \fIboth\fR implementations. \fBLaxNum\fR is measurably
faster.
.Sp
The \fBNum\fR type constraint is currently an alias for \fBLaxNum\fR unless you
set the \f(CW\*(C`PERL_TYPES_STANDARD_STRICTNUM\*(C'\fR environment variable to true before
loading Types::Standard, in which case it becomes an alias for \fBStrictNum\fR.
The constant \f(CW\*(C`Types::Standard::STRICTNUM\*(C'\fR can be used to check if
\&\fBNum\fR is being strict.
.Sp
Most people should probably use \fBNum\fR or \fBStrictNum\fR. Don't explicitly
use \fBLaxNum\fR unless you specifically need an attribute which will accept
things like \*(L"Inf\*(R".
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBCycleTuple[`a]\fR
.Sp
Similar to \fBTuple\fR, but cyclical.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   CycleTuple[Int, HashRef]
.Ve
.Sp
will allow \f(CW\*(C`[1,{}]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[1,{},2,{}]\*(C'\fR but disallow
\&\f(CW\*(C`[1,{},2]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[1,{},2,[]]\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
I think you understand \fBCycleTuple\fR already.
.Sp
Currently \fBOptional\fR and \f(CW\*(C`slurpy\*(C'\fR parameters are forbidden. There are
fairly limited use cases for them, and it's not exactly clear what they
should mean.
.Sp
The following is an efficient way of checking for an even-sized arrayref:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   CycleTuple[Any, Any]
.Ve
.Sp
The following is an arrayref which would be suitable for coercing to a
hashref:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   CycleTuple[Str, Any]
.Ve
.Sp
All the examples so far have used two parameters, but the following is
also a possible \fBCycleTuple\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   CycleTuple[Str, Int, HashRef]
.Ve
.Sp
This will be an arrayref where the 0th, 3rd, 6th, etc values are
strings, the 1st, 4th, 7th, etc values are integers, and the 2nd,
5th, 8th, etc values are hashrefs.
.SS "Coercions"
.IX Subsection "Coercions"
Most of the types in this type library have no coercions by default.
The exception is \fBBool\fR as of Types::Standard 1.003_003, which coerces
from \fBAny\fR via \f(CW\*(C`!!$_\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Some standalone coercions may be exported. These can be combined
with type constraints using the \f(CW\*(C`plus_coercions\*(C'\fR method.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBMkOpt\fR
.Sp
A coercion from \fBArrayRef\fR, \fBHashRef\fR or \fBUndef\fR to \fBOptList\fR. Example
usage in a Moose attribute:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   use Types::Standard qw( OptList MkOpt );
\&   
\&   has options => (
\&      is     => "ro",
\&      isa    => OptList\->plus_coercions( MkOpt ),
\&      coerce => 1,
\&   );
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBSplit[`a]\fR
.Sp
Split a string on a regexp.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   use Types::Standard qw( ArrayRef Str Split );
\&   
\&   has name => (
\&      is     => "ro",
\&      isa    => ArrayRef\->of(Str)\->plus_coercions(Split[qr/\es/]),
\&      coerce => 1,
\&   );
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBJoin[`a]\fR
.Sp
Join an array of strings with a delimiter.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   use Types::Standard qw( Str Join );
\&   
\&   my $FileLines = Str\->plus_coercions(Join["\en"]);
\&   
\&   has file_contents => (
\&      is     => "ro",
\&      isa    => $FileLines,
\&      coerce => 1,
\&   );

.ie n .IP """Types::Standard::STRICTNUM""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWTypes::Standard::STRICTNUM\fR" 4

Switches to more strict regexp-based number checking instead of using
\&\f(CW\*(C`looks_like_number\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP """PERL_TYPE_TINY_XS""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWPERL_TYPE_TINY_XS\fR" 4

If set to false, can be used to suppress the loading of \s-1XS\s0 implementions of
some type constraints.
.ie n .IP """PERL_ONLY""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWPERL_ONLY\fR" 4
.IX Item "PERL_ONLY"
If \f(CW\*(C`PERL_TYPE_TINY_XS\*(C'\fR does not exist, can be set to true to suppress \s-1XS\s0
usage similarly. (Several other \s-1CPAN\s0 distributions also pay attention to this
environment variable.)

Types::XSD provides some type constraints based on \s-1XML\s0 Schema's data
types; this includes constraints for ISO8601\-formatted datetimes, integer
ranges (e.g. \fBPositiveInteger[maxInclusive=>10]\fR and so on.

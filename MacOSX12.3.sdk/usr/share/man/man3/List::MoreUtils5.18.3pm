.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBList::MoreUtils\fR provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality on
lists which is not going to go into List::Util.
.PP
All of the below functions are implementable in only a couple of lines of Perl
code. Using the functions from this module however should give slightly better
performance as everything is implemented in C. The pure-Perl implementation of
these functions only serves as a fallback in case the C portions of this module
couldn't be compiled on this machine.
.SH "EXPORTS"
.IX Header "EXPORTS"
.SS "Default behavior"
.IX Subsection "Default behavior"
Nothing by default. To import all of this module's symbols use the \f(CW\*(C`:all\*(C'\fR tag.
Otherwise functions can be imported by name as usual:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use List::MoreUtils \*(Aq:all\*(Aq;
\&
\&    use List::MoreUtils qw{ any firstidx };
.Ve
.PP
Because historical changes to the \s-1API\s0 might make upgrading List::MoreUtils
difficult for some projects, the legacy \s-1API\s0 is available via special import
tags.
.SS "Like version 0.22 (last release with original \s-1API\s0)"
.IX Subsection "Like version 0.22 (last release with original API)"
This \s-1API\s0 was available from 2006 to 2009, returning undef for empty lists on
\&\f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`notall\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use List::MoreUtils \*(Aq:like_0.22\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
This import tag will import all functions available as of version 0.22.
However, it will import \f(CW\*(C`any_u\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`all_u\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`none_u\*(C'\fR as
\&\f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`notall_u\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`notall\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Like version 0.24 (first incompatible change)"
.IX Subsection "Like version 0.24 (first incompatible change)"
This \s-1API\s0 was available from 2010 to 2011.  It changed the return value of \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR
and added the \f(CW\*(C`bsearch\*(C'\fR function.
.PP

\&\f(CW\*(C`notall_u\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`notall\*(C'\fR.  It will import \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR as described in
the documentation below (true for empty list).
.SS "Like version 0.33 (second incompatible change)"
.IX Subsection "Like version 0.33 (second incompatible change)"
This \s-1API\s0 was available from 2011 to 2014. It is widely used in several \s-1CPAN\s0
modules and thus it's closest to the current \s-1API. \s0 It changed the return values
of \f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`notall\*(C'\fR.  It added the \f(CW\*(C`sort_by\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`nsort_by\*(C'\fR functions
and the \f(CW\*(C`distinct\*(C'\fR alias for \f(CW\*(C`uniq\*(C'\fR.  It omitted \f(CW\*(C`bsearch\*(C'\fR.
.PP

.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
.SS "Junctions"
.IX Subsection "Junctions"
\fI\fITreatment of an empty list\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Treatment of an empty list"
.PP
There are two schools of thought for how to evaluate a junction on an
empty list:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Reduction to an identity (boolean)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Result is undefined (three-valued)
.PP
In the first case, the result of the junction applied to the empty list is
determined by a mathematical reduction to an identity depending on whether
the underlying comparison is \*(L"or\*(R" or \*(L"and\*(R".  Conceptually:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&                    "any are true"      "all are true"
\&                    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-      \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&    2 elements:     A || B || 0         A && B && 1
\&    1 element:      A || 0              A && 1
\&    0 elements:     0                   1
.Ve
.PP
In the second case, three-value logic is desired, in which a junction
applied to an empty list returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR rather than true or false
.PP
Junctions with a \f(CW\*(C`_u\*(C'\fR suffix implement three-valued logic.  Those
without are boolean.
.PP
\fIall \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "all BLOCK LIST"
.PP
\fIall_u \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "all_u BLOCK LIST"
.PP
Returns a true value if all items in \s-1LIST\s0 meet the criterion given through
\&\s-1BLOCK.\s0 Sets \f(CW$_\fR for each item in \s-1LIST\s0 in turn:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  print "All values are non\-negative"
\&    if all { $_ >= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);
.Ve
.PP
For an empty \s-1LIST, \s0\f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR returns true (i.e. no values failed the condition)
and \f(CW\*(C`all_u\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Thus, \f(CW\*(C`all_u(@list)\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`@list ? all(@list) : undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: because Perl treats \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR as false, you must check the return value
of \f(CW\*(C`all_u\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`defined\*(C'\fR or you will get the opposite result of what you
expect.

.PP
.Vb 2

.Ve
.PP
For an empty \s-1LIST, \s0\f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR returns true (i.e. no values failed the condition)
and \f(CW\*(C`none_u\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Thus, \f(CW\*(C`none_u(@list)\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`@list ? none(@list) : undef\*(C'\fR.

\fInotall_u \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "notall_u BLOCK LIST"
.PP
Logically the negation of \f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR. Returns a true value if not all items in \s-1LIST\s0
meet the criterion given through \s-1BLOCK.\s0 Sets \f(CW$_\fR for each item in \s-1LIST\s0 in
turn:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  print "Not all values are non\-negative"
\&    if notall { $_ >= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);
.Ve
.PP
For an empty \s-1LIST, \s0\f(CW\*(C`notall\*(C'\fR returns false and \f(CW\*(C`notall_u\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Thus, \f(CW\*(C`notall_u(@list)\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`@list ? notall(@list) : undef\*(C'\fR.

\fIone_u \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "one_u BLOCK LIST"

Returns a true value if precisely one item in \s-1LIST\s0 meets the criterion

.PP
.Vb 2
\&    print "Precisely one value defined"

.Ve
.PP
Returns false otherwise.
.PP
For an empty \s-1LIST, \s0\f(CW\*(C`one\*(C'\fR returns false and \f(CW\*(C`one_u\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The expression \f(CW\*(C`one BLOCK LIST\*(C'\fR is almost equivalent to

.IX Subsection "sort_by BLOCK LIST"
.PP
Returns the list of values sorted according to the string values returned by the

to the string value of some accessor, such as
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sort_by { $_\->name } @people
.Ve
.PP
The key function is called in scalar context, being passed each value in turn as
both \f(CW$_\fR and the only argument in the parameters, \f(CW@_\fR. The values are then sorted
according to string comparisons on the values returned.
This is equivalent to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sort { $a\->name cmp $b\->name } @people
.Ve
.PP
except that it guarantees the name accessor will be executed only once per value.
One interesting use-case is to sort strings which may have numbers embedded in them
\&\*(L"naturally\*(R", rather than lexically.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sort_by { s/(\ed+)/sprintf "%09d", $1/eg; $_ } @strings

some level (9 digits in this case), helping to ensure the lexical sort puts them
in the correct order.

Performs a binary search on \s-1LIST\s0 which must be a sorted list of values. \s-1BLOCK\s0
must return a negative value if the current element (stored in \f(CW$_\fR) is smaller,
a positive value if it is bigger and zero if it matches.

Reduce \s-1LIST\s0 by calling \s-1BLOCK\s0 in scalar context for each element of \s-1LIST.
\&\s0\f(CW$a\fR contains the progressional result and is initialized with 1.
\&\f(CW$b\fR contains the current processed element of \s-1LIST\s0 and \f(CW$_\fR contains the

Reduce \s-1LIST\s0 by calling \s-1BLOCK\s0 in scalar context for each element of \s-1LIST.
\&\s0\f(CW$a\fR contains the progressional result and is initialized with 1.
\&\f(CW$b\fR contains the current processed element of \s-1LIST\s0 and \f(CW$_\fR contains the

\fIminmax \s-1LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "minmax LIST"
.PP
Calculates the minimum and maximum of \s-1LIST\s0 and returns a two element list with
the first element being the minimum and the second the maximum. Returns the
empty list if \s-1LIST\s0 was empty.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`minmax\*(C'\fR algorithm differs from a naive iteration over the list where each
element is compared to two values being the so far calculated min and max value
in that it only requires 3n/2 \- 2 comparisons. Thus it is the most efficient
possible algorithm.
.PP
However, the Perl implementation of it has some overhead simply due to the fact
that there are more lines of Perl code involved. Therefore, \s-1LIST\s0 needs to be
fairly big in order for \f(CW\*(C`minmax\*(C'\fR to win over a naive implementation. This
limitation does not apply to the \s-1XS\s0 version.
.PP
\fIminmaxstr \s-1LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "minmaxstr LIST"
.PP
Computes the minimum and maximum of \s-1LIST\s0 using string compare and returns a
two element list with the first element being the minimum and the second the
maximum. Returns the empty list if \s-1LIST\s0 was empty.
.PP
The implementation is similar to \f(CW\*(C`minmax\*(C'\fR.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
When \f(CW\*(C`LIST_MOREUTILS_PP\*(C'\fR is set, the module will always use the pure-Perl
implementation and not the \s-1XS\s0 one. This environment variable is really just
there for the test-suite to force testing the Perl implementation, and possibly
for reporting of bugs. I don't see any reason to use it in a production
environment.
.SH "MAINTENANCE"
.IX Header "MAINTENANCE"
The maintenance goal is to preserve the documented semantics of the \s-1API\s0;
bug fixes that bring actual behavior in line with semantics are allowed.
New \s-1API\s0 functions may be added over time.  If a backwards incompatible
change is unavoidable, we will attempt to provide support for the legacy
\&\s-1API\s0 using the same export tag mechanism currently in place.
.PP
This module attempts to use few non-core dependencies. Non-core
configuration and testing modules will be bundled when reasonable;
run-time dependencies will be added only if they deliver substantial
benefit.
.SH "CONTRIBUTING"
.IX Header "CONTRIBUTING"
While contributions are appreciated, a contribution should not cause more
effort for the maintainer than the contribution itself saves (see
Open Source Contribution Etiquette <http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html>).
.PP

.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
There is a problem with a bug in 5.6.x perls. It is a syntax error to write
things like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } qw{ foo bar baz };
.Ve
.PP
It has to be written as either
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbaz\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } my @dummy = qw/foo bar baz/;
.Ve
.PP
Perl 5.5.x and Perl 5.8.x don't suffer from this limitation.
.PP
If you have a functionality that you could imagine being in this module, please
drop me a line. This module's policy will be less strict than List::Util's
when it comes to additions as it isn't a core module.
.PP
When you report bugs, it would be nice if you could additionally give me the
output of your program with the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`LIST_MOREUTILS_PP\*(C'\fR set
to a true value. That way I know where to look for the problem (in \s-1XS,\s0
pure-Perl or possibly both).

If you have a bug report, a patch or a suggestion, please open a new
report ticket at \s-1CPAN \s0(but please check previous reports first in case
your issue has already been addressed) or open an issue on GitHub.
.PP
Report tickets should contain a detailed description of the bug or
enhancement request and at least an easily verifiable way of
reproducing the issue or fix. Patches are always welcome, too \- and
it's cheap to send pull-requests on GitHub. Please keep in mind that
code changes are more likely accepted when they're bundled with an
approving test.

Bugs and feature requests are accepted against the latest version
only. To get patches for earlier versions, you need to get an
agreement with a developer of your choice \- who may or not report the
issue and a suggested fix upstream (depends on the license you have
chosen).

Generally, in volunteered projects, there is no right for support.
While every maintainer is happy to improve the provided software,
spare time is limited.
.PP
For those who have a use case which requires guaranteed support, one of
the maintainers should be hired or contracted.  For business support you
can contact Jens via his \s-1CPAN\s0 email address rehsackATcpan.org. Please
keep in mind that business support is neither available for free nor

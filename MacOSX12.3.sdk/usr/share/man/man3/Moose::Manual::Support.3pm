.SH "NAME"
Moose::Manual::Support \- Policies regarding support, releases, and compatibility.
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 2.2012
.SH "SUPPORT POLICY"
.IX Header "SUPPORT POLICY"
There are two principles to Moose's policy of supported behavior.
.IP "1." 4
Moose favors correctness over everything.
.IP "2." 4
Moose supports documented and tested behavior, not accidental behavior or side
effects.
.PP
If a behavior has never been documented or tested, the behavior is
\&\fIofficially\fR undefined. Relying upon undocumented and untested behavior is
done at your own risk.
.PP
If a behavior is documented or tested but found to be incorrect later, the
behavior will go through a deprecation period. During the deprecation period,
use of that feature will cause a warning. Eventually, the deprecated feature
will be removed.
.PP
In some cases, it is not possible to deprecate a behavior. In this case, the
behavior will simply be changed in a major release.
.SH "RELEASE SCHEDULE"
.IX Header "RELEASE SCHEDULE"
Moose is on a system of quarterly major releases, with minor releases as
needed between major releases. A minor release is defined as one that makes
every attempt to preserve backwards compatibility. Currently this means that we
did not introduce any new dependency conflicts, and that we did not make any
changes to documented or tested behavior (this typically means that minor
releases will not change any existing tests in the test suite, although they
can add new ones). A minor release can include new features and bug fixes.
.PP
Major releases may be backwards incompatible. Moose prioritizes
correctness over backwards compatibility or performance; see the \s-1DEPRECATION
POLICY\s0 to understand how backwards incompatible changes are announced.
.PP
Major releases are scheduled to happen during fixed release windows. If the
window is missed, then there will not be a major release until the next
release window. The release windows are one month long, and occur during the
months of January, April, July, and October.
.PP
Before a major release, a series of development releases will be made so that
users can test the upcoming major release before it is distributed to \s-1CPAN.\s0 It
is in the best interests of everyone involved if these releases are tested as
widely as possible.
.SH "DEPRECATION POLICY"
.IX Header "DEPRECATION POLICY"
Moose has always prioritized correctness over performance and backwards
compatibility.
.PP
Major deprecations or \s-1API\s0 changes are documented in the Changes file as well
as in Moose::Manual::Delta. The Moose developers will also make an effort
to warn users of upcoming deprecations and breakage through the Moose blog
(http://blog.moose.perl.org).
.PP
Deprecated APIs will be preserved for at least one year \fIafter the major
release which deprecates that \s-1API\s0\fR. Deprecated APIs will only be removed in a
major release.
.PP
Moose will also warn during installation if the version of Moose being
installed will break an installed dependency. Unfortunately, due to the nature
of the Perl install process these warnings may be easy to miss.
.SH "BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY"
.IX Header "BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY"
We try to ensure compatibility by having a extensive test suite (last count
over 18000 tests), as well as testing a number of packages (currently just
under 100 packages) that depend on Moose before any release.
.PP
The current list of downstream dependencies that are tested is in
\&\f(CW\*(C`xt/author/test\-my\-dependents.t\*(C'\fR.
.SH "VERSION NUMBERS"
.IX Header "VERSION NUMBERS"
Moose version numbers consist of three parts, in the form X.YYZZ. The X is the
\&\*(L"special magic number\*(R" that only gets changed for really big changes. Think of
this as being like the \*(L"5\*(R" in Perl 5.12.1.
.PP
The \s-1YY\s0 portion is the major version number. Moose uses even numbers for stable
releases, and odd numbers for trial releases. The \s-1ZZ\s0 is the minor version, and
it simply increases monotonically. It starts at \*(L"00\*(R" each time a new major
version is released.
.PP
Semantically, this means that any two releases which share a major version
should be API-compatible with each other. In other words, 2.0200, 2.0201, and
2.0274 are all API-compatible.
.PP
Prior to version 2.0, Moose version numbers were monotonically incrementing
two decimal values (0.01, 0.02, ... 1.11, 1.12, etc.).
.PP
Moose was declared production ready at version 0.18 (via <http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=608144>).
.SH "PERL VERSION COMPATIBILITY"
.IX Header "PERL VERSION COMPATIBILITY"
As of version 2.16, Moose will officially support being run on perl 5.10.1+. Our
current policy is to support the earliest version of Perl shipped in the latest
stable release of any major operating system (this tends to mean CentOS). We
will provide at least six months notice (two major releases) when we decide to
increase the officially supported Perl version.
.PP
\&\*(L"Officially supported\*(R" does not mean that these are the only versions of Perl
that Moose will work with. Our declared perl dependency will remain at 5.8.3
as long as our test suite continues to pass on 5.8.3. What this does mean is
that the core Moose dev team will not be spending any time fixing bugs on
versions that aren't officially supported, and new contributions will not be
rejected due to being incompatible with older versions of perl except in the
most trivial of cases. We will, however, still welcome patches to make Moose
compatible with earlier versions, if other people are still interested in
maintaining compatibility. As such, the current minimum required version of
5.8.3 will remain for as long as downstream users are happy to assist with
maintenance.
.PP
Note that although performance regressions are acceptable in order to maintain
backwards compatibility (as long as they only affect the older versions),
functionality changes and buggy behavior will not be. If it becomes impossible
to provide identical functionality between modern Perl versions and
unsupported Perl versions, we will increase our declared perl dependency
instead.
.SH "CONTRIBUTING"
.IX Header "CONTRIBUTING"
Moose has an open contribution policy. Anybody is welcome to submit a
patch. Please see Moose::Manual::Contributing for more details.

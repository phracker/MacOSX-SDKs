PPI::Statement::Package \- A package statement
.SH "INHERITANCE"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Most PPI::Statement subclasses are assigned based on the value of the
first token or word found in the statement. When \s-1PPI\s0 encounters a statement
starting with 'package', it converts it to a \f(CW\*(C`PPI::Statement::Package\*(C'\fR
object.
.PP
When working with package statements, please remember that packages only
exist within their scope, and proper support for scoping has yet to be
completed in \s-1PPI.\s0
.PP
However, if the immediate parent of the package statement is the
top level PPI::Document object, then it can be considered to define
everything found until the next top-level \*(L"file scoped\*(R" package statement.
.PP
A file may, however, contain nested temporary package, in which case you
are mostly on your own :)
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`PPI::Statement::Package\*(C'\fR has a number of methods in addition to the standard
PPI::Statement, PPI::Node and PPI::Element methods.
.SS "namespace"
.IX Subsection "namespace"
Most package declarations are simple, and just look something like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  package Foo::Bar;
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`namespace\*(C'\fR method returns the name of the declared package, in the
above case 'Foo::Bar'. It returns this exactly as written and does not
attempt to clean up or resolve things like ::Foo to main::Foo.
.PP
If the package statement is done any different way, it returns false.
.SS "version"
.IX Subsection "version"
Some package declarations may include a version:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  package Foo::Bar 1.23;
\&  package Baz v1.23;
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`version\*(C'\fR method returns the stringified version as seen in the
document (if any), otherwise the empty string.
.SS "file_scoped"
.IX Subsection "file_scoped"
Regardless of whether it is named or not, the \f(CW\*(C`file_scoped\*(C'\fR method will
test to see if the package declaration is a top level \*(L"file scoped\*(R"
statement or not, based on its location.
.PP
In general, returns true if it is a \*(L"file scoped\*(R" package declaration with
an immediate parent of the top level Document, or false if not.
.PP
Note that if the \s-1PPI DOM\s0 tree \fBdoes not\fR have a PPI::Document object at
as the root element, this will return false. Likewise, it will also return
false if the root element is a PPI::Document::Fragment, as a fragment of
a file does not represent a scope.

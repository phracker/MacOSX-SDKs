.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.IX Header "INTRODUCTION"
(by Mark-Jason Dominus)
.PP
I once read an article written by the authors of \f(CW\*(C`diff\*(C'\fR; they said
that they worked very hard on the algorithm until they found the
right one.
.PP
I think what they ended up using (and I hope someone will correct me,
because I am not very confident about this) was the `longest common
subsequence' method.  In the \s-1LCS\s0 problem, you have two sequences of
items:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    a b c d f g h j q z
\&
\&    a b c d e f g i j k r x y z
.Ve
.PP
and you want to find the longest sequence of items that is present in
both original sequences in the same order.  That is, you want to find
a new sequence \fIS\fR which can be obtained from the first sequence by
deleting some items, and from the secend sequence by deleting other
items.  You also want \fIS\fR to be as long as possible.  In this case \fIS\fR
is
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    a b c d f g j z
.Ve
.PP
From there it's only a small step to get diff-like output:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    e   h i   k   q r x y
\&    +   \- +   +   \- + + +
.Ve
.PP
This module solves the \s-1LCS\s0 problem.  It also includes a canned function
to generate \f(CW\*(C`diff\*(C'\fR\-like output.
.PP
It might seem from the example above that the \s-1LCS\s0 of two sequences is
always pretty obvious, but that's not always the case, especially when
the two sequences have many repeated elements.  For example, consider
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    a x b y c z p d q
\&    a b c a x b y c z
.Ve
.PP
A naive approach might start by matching up the \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR that
appear at the beginning of each sequence, like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    a x b y c         z p d q
\&    a   b   c a b y c z
.Ve
.PP
This finds the common subsequence \f(CW\*(C`a b c z\*(C'\fR.  But actually, the \s-1LCS\s0
is \f(CW\*(C`a x b y c z\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&          a x b y c z p d q
\&    a b c a x b y c z
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    a       x b y c z p d q
\&    a b c a x b y c z
.Ve
.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
(See also the \s-1README\s0 file and several example
scripts include with this module.)
.PP
This module now provides an object-oriented interface that uses less
memory and is easier to use than most of the previous procedural
interfaces.  It also still provides several exportable functions.  We'll
deal with these in ascending order of difficulty:  \f(CW\*(C`LCS\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`LCS_length\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`LCSidx\*(C'\fR, \s-1OO\s0 interface, \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`diff\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sdiff\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`traverse_sequences\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`traverse_balanced\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS """LCS"""
.el .SS "\f(CWLCS\fP"
.IX Subsection "LCS"
Given references to two lists of items, \s-1LCS\s0 returns an array containing
their longest common subsequence.  In scalar context, it returns a
reference to such a list.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    @lcs    = LCS( \e@seq1, \e@seq2 );
\&    $lcsref = LCS( \e@seq1, \e@seq2 );
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`LCS\*(C'\fR may be passed an optional third parameter; this is a \s-1CODE\s0
reference to a key generation function.  See \*(L"\s-1KEY GENERATION
FUNCTIONS\*(R"\s0.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    @lcs    = LCS( \e@seq1, \e@seq2, \e&keyGen, @args );
\&    $lcsref = LCS( \e@seq1, \e@seq2, \e&keyGen, @args );
.Ve
.PP
Additional parameters, if any, will be passed to the key generation
routine.
.ie n .SS """LCS_length"""
.el .SS "\f(CWLCS_length\fP"
.IX Subsection "LCS_length"
This is just like \f(CW\*(C`LCS\*(C'\fR except it only returns the length of the
longest common subsequence.  This provides a performance gain of about
9% compared to \f(CW\*(C`LCS\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS """LCSidx"""
.el .SS "\f(CWLCSidx\fP"
.IX Subsection "LCSidx"
Like \f(CW\*(C`LCS\*(C'\fR except it returns references to two arrays.  The first array
contains the indices into \f(CW@seq1\fR where the \s-1LCS\s0 items are located.  The
second array contains the indices into \f(CW@seq2\fR where the \s-1LCS\s0 items are located.
.PP
Therefore, the following three lists will contain the same values:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    my( $idx1, $idx2 ) = LCSidx( \e@seq1, \e@seq2 );
\&    my @list1 = @seq1[ @$idx1 ];
\&    my @list2 = @seq2[ @$idx2 ];
\&    my @list3 = LCS( \e@seq1, \e@seq2 );
.Ve
.ie n .SS """new"""
.el .SS "\f(CWnew\fP"
.IX Subsection "new"
.Vb 2
\&    $diff = Algorithm::Diffs\->new( \e@seq1, \e@seq2 );
\&    $diff = Algorithm::Diffs\->new( \e@seq1, \e@seq2, \e%opts );
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR computes the smallest set of additions and deletions necessary
to turn the first sequence into the second and compactly records them
in the object.
.PP
You use the object to iterate over \fIhunks\fR, where each hunk represents
a contiguous section of items which should be added, deleted, replaced,
or left unchanged.

Method summary:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    $obj        = Algorithm::Diff\->new( \e@seq1, \e@seq2, [ \e%opts ] );
\&    $pos        = $obj\->Next(  [ $count : 1 ] );

\&    $copy       = $obj\->Copy(  [ $pos, [ $newBase ] ] );
\&    $oldBase    = $obj\->Base(  [ $newBase ] );
.Ve
.Sp
Note that all of the following methods \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR if used on an object that
is \*(L"reset\*(R" (not currently pointing at any hunk).
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    $bits       = $obj\->Diff(  );
\&    @items|$cnt = $obj\->Same(  );
\&    @items|$cnt = $obj\->Items( $seqNum );
\&    @idxs |$cnt = $obj\->Range( $seqNum, [ $base ] );
\&    $minIdx     = $obj\->Min(   $seqNum, [ $base ] );
\&    $maxIdx     = $obj\->Max(   $seqNum, [ $base ] );
\&    @values     = $obj\->Get(   @names );
.Ve
.Sp
Passing in \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR for an optional argument is always treated the same
as if no argument were passed in.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Next\*(C'\fR
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $pos = $diff\->Next();    # Move forward 1 hunk
\&    $pos = $diff\->Next( 2 ); # Move forward 2 hunks
\&    $pos = $diff\->Next(\-5);  # Move backward 5 hunks
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Next\*(C'\fR moves the object to point at the next hunk.  The object starts
out \*(L"reset\*(R", which means it isn't pointing at any hunk.  If the object
is reset, then \f(CW\*(C`Next()\*(C'\fR moves to the first hunk.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Next\*(C'\fR returns a true value iff the move didn't go past the last hunk.
So \f(CWNext(0)\fR will return true iff the object is not reset.
.Sp
Actually, \f(CW\*(C`Next\*(C'\fR returns the object's new position, which is a number
between 1 and the number of hunks (inclusive), or returns a false value.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Prev\*(C'\fR
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Prev($N)\*(C'\fR is almost identical to \f(CW\*(C`Next(\-$N)\*(C'\fR; it moves to the \f(CW$Nth\fR
previous hunk.  On a 'reset' object, \f(CW\*(C`Prev()\*(C'\fR [and \f(CW\*(C`Next(\-1)\*(C'\fR] move
to the last hunk.
.Sp
The position returned by \f(CW\*(C`Prev\*(C'\fR is relative to the \fIend\fR of the
hunks; \-1 for the last hunk, \-2 for the second-to-last, etc.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Reset\*(C'\fR
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    $diff\->Reset();     # Reset the object\*(Aqs position
\&    $diff\->Reset($pos); # Move to the specified hunk
\&    $diff\->Reset(1);    # Move to the first hunk
\&    $diff\->Reset(\-1);   # Move to the last hunk
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Reset\*(C'\fR returns the object, so, for example, you could use
\&\f(CW\*(C`$diff\->Reset()\->Next(\-1)\*(C'\fR to get the number of hunks.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Copy\*(C'\fR
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $copy = $diff\->Copy( $newPos, $newBase );
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Copy\*(C'\fR returns a copy of the object.  The copy and the orignal object
share most of their data, so making copies takes very little memory.
The copy maintains its own position (separate from the original), which
is the main purpose of copies.  It also maintains its own base.
.Sp
By default, the copy's position starts out the same as the original
object's position.  But \f(CW\*(C`Copy\*(C'\fR takes an optional first argument to set the
new position, so the following three snippets are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $copy = $diff\->Copy($pos);
\&
\&    $copy = $diff\->Copy();
\&    $copy\->Reset($pos);
\&
\&    $copy = $diff\->Copy()\->Reset($pos);
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Copy\*(C'\fR takes an optional second argument to set the base for
the copy.  If you wish to change the base of the copy but leave
the position the same as in the original, here are two
equivalent ways:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $copy = $diff\->Copy();
\&    $copy\->Base( 0 );
\&
\&    $copy = $diff\->Copy(undef,0);
.Ve
.Sp
Here are two equivalent way to get a \*(L"reset\*(R" copy:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $copy = $diff\->Copy(0);
\&
\&    $copy = $diff\->Copy()\->Reset();
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Diff\*(C'\fR
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $bits = $obj\->Diff();
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Diff\*(C'\fR returns a true value iff the current hunk contains items that are
different between the two sequences.  It actually returns one of the
follow 4 values:
.IP "3" 4
.IX Item "3"
\&\f(CW\*(C`3==(1|2)\*(C'\fR.  This hunk contains items from \f(CW@seq1\fR and the items
from \f(CW@seq2\fR that should replace them.  Both sequence 1 and 2
contain changed items so both the 1 and 2 bits are set.
.IP "2" 4
.IX Item "2"
This hunk only contains items from \f(CW@seq2\fR that should be inserted (not
items from \f(CW@seq1\fR).  Only sequence 2 contains changed items so only the 2
bit is set.
.IP "1" 4
.IX Item "1"
This hunk only contains items from \f(CW@seq1\fR that should be deleted (not
items from \f(CW@seq2\fR).  Only sequence 1 contains changed items so only the 1
bit is set.
.IP "0" 4
This means that the items in this hunk are the same in both sequences.
Neither sequence 1 nor 2 contain changed items so neither the 1 nor the
2 bits are set.

\&\f(CW\*(C`Range\*(C'\fR is like \f(CW\*(C`Items\*(C'\fR except that it returns a list of \fIindices\fR to
the items rather than the items themselves.  By default, the index of
the first item (in each sequence) is 0 but this can be changed by
calling the \f(CW\*(C`Base\*(C'\fR method.  So, by default, the following two snippets

\&    /^(\-?\ed+)?(min|max)[12]$/i
\&    /^(range[12]|same|diff|base)$/i
.Ve
.Sp
The 1 or 2 after a name says which sequence you want the information
for (and where allowed, it is required).  The optional number before
\&\*(L"min\*(R" or \*(L"max\*(R" is the base to use.  So the following equalities hold:
.Sp

.PP
The 0th, 2nd, 4th, etc. entries are all indices into \f(CW@seq1\fR (@a in the
above example) indicating where a hunk begins.  The 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.
entries are all indices into \f(CW@seq2\fR (@b in the above example) indicating
where the same hunk begins.
.PP
So each pair of indices (except the last pair) describes where a hunk
begins (in each sequence).  Since each hunk must end at the item just
before the item that starts the next hunk, the next pair of indices can
be used to determine where the hunk ends.
.PP
So, the first 4 entries (0..3) describe the first hunk.  Entries 0 and 1
describe where the first hunk begins (and so are always both 0).
Entries 2 and 3 describe where the next hunk begins, so subtracting 1
from each tells us where the first hunk ends.  That is, the first hunk
contains items \f(CW$diff[0]\fR through \f(CW\*(C`$diff[2] \- 1\*(C'\fR of the first sequence
and contains items \f(CW$diff[1]\fR through \f(CW\*(C`$diff[3] \- 1\*(C'\fR of the second
sequence.
.PP
In other words, the first hunk consists of the following two lists of items:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&               #  1st pair     2nd pair
\&               # of indices   of indices
\&    @list1 = @a[ $cdiff[0] .. $cdiff[2]\-1 ];
\&    @list2 = @b[ $cdiff[1] .. $cdiff[3]\-1 ];
\&               # Hunk start   Hunk end
.Ve
.PP
Note that the hunks will always alternate between those that are part of
the \s-1LCS \s0(those that contain unchanged items) and those that contain
changes.  This means that all we need to be told is whether the first
hunk is a 'same' or 'diff' hunk and we can determine which of the other
hunks contain 'same' items or 'diff' items.
.PP
By convention, we always make the first hunk contain unchanged items.
So the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. hunks (all odd-numbered hunks if you start
counting from 1) all contain unchanged items.  And the 2nd, 4th, 6th,
etc. hunks (all even-numbered hunks if you start counting from 1) all
contain changed items.
.PP
Since \f(CW@a\fR and \f(CW@b\fR don't begin with the same value, the first hunk in our
example is empty (otherwise we'd violate the above convention).  Note
that the first 4 index values in our example are all zero.  Plug these
values into our previous code block and we get:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    @hunk1a = @a[ 0 .. 0\-1 ];
\&    @hunk1b = @b[ 0 .. 0\-1 ];
.Ve
.PP
And \f(CW\*(C`0..\-1\*(C'\fR returns the empty list.
.PP
Move down one pair of indices (2..5) and we get the offset ranges for
the second hunk, which contains changed items.
.PP
Since \f(CW@diff[2..5]\fR contains (0,0,1,0) in our example, the second hunk
consists of these two lists of items:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&        @hunk2a = @a[ $cdiff[2] .. $cdiff[4]\-1 ];
\&        @hunk2b = @b[ $cdiff[3] .. $cdiff[5]\-1 ];
\&    # or
\&        @hunk2a = @a[ 0 .. 1\-1 ];
\&        @hunk2b = @b[ 0 .. 0\-1 ];
\&    # or
\&        @hunk2a = @a[ 0 .. 0 ];
\&        @hunk2b = @b[ 0 .. \-1 ];
\&    # or
\&        @hunk2a = ( \*(Aqa\*(Aq );
\&        @hunk2b = ( );
.Ve
.PP
That is, we would delete item 0 ('a') from \f(CW@a\fR.
.PP
Since \f(CW@diff[4..7]\fR contains (1,0,3,2) in our example, the third hunk
consists of these two lists of items:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&        @hunk3a = @a[ $cdiff[4] .. $cdiff[6]\-1 ];
\&        @hunk3a = @b[ $cdiff[5] .. $cdiff[7]\-1 ];
\&    # or
\&        @hunk3a = @a[ 1 .. 3\-1 ];
\&        @hunk3a = @b[ 0 .. 2\-1 ];
\&    # or
\&        @hunk3a = @a[ 1 .. 2 ];
\&        @hunk3a = @b[ 0 .. 1 ];
\&    # or
\&        @hunk3a = qw( b c );
\&        @hunk3a = qw( b c );
.Ve
.PP
Note that this third hunk contains unchanged items as our convention demands.
.PP
You can continue this process until you reach the last two indices,
which will always be the number of items in each sequence.  This is
required so that subtracting one from each will give you the indices to
the last items in each sequence.

sequence A, and arrow B points to an element of the sequence B. 
Initially, the arrows point to the first elements of the respective
sequences.  \f(CW\*(C`traverse_sequences\*(C'\fR will advance the arrows through the

callback function before each advance.  It willadvance the arrows in
such a way that if there are equal elements \f(CW$A[$i]\fR and \f(CW$B[$j]\fR
which are equal and which are part of the \s-1LCS,\s0 there will be some moment

one of them and call the appropriate callback, but it is not specified

By default, comparisons will use \*(L"eq\*(R" and elements will be turned into keys
using the default stringizing operator '""'.
.PP
Where this is important is when you're comparing something other than
strings.  If it is the case that you have multiple different objects
that should be considered to be equal, you should supply a key
generation function. Otherwise, you have to make sure that your arrays
contain unique references.
.PP
For instance, consider this example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package Person;
\&
\&    sub new
\&    {
\&        my $package = shift;
\&        return bless { name => \*(Aq\*(Aq, ssn => \*(Aq\*(Aq, @_ }, $package;
\&    }
\&
\&    sub clone
\&    {
\&        my $old = shift;
\&        my $new = bless { %$old }, ref($old);
\&    }
\&
\&    sub hash
\&    {
\&        return shift()\->{\*(Aqssn\*(Aq};
\&    }
\&
\&    my $person1 = Person\->new( name => \*(AqJoe\*(Aq, ssn => \*(Aq123\-45\-6789\*(Aq );
\&    my $person2 = Person\->new( name => \*(AqMary\*(Aq, ssn => \*(Aq123\-47\-0000\*(Aq );
\&    my $person3 = Person\->new( name => \*(AqPete\*(Aq, ssn => \*(Aq999\-45\-2222\*(Aq );
\&    my $person4 = Person\->new( name => \*(AqPeggy\*(Aq, ssn => \*(Aq123\-45\-9999\*(Aq );
\&    my $person5 = Person\->new( name => \*(AqFrank\*(Aq, ssn => \*(Aq000\-45\-9999\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
If you did this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $array1 = [ $person1, $person2, $person4 ];
\&    my $array2 = [ $person1, $person3, $person4, $person5 ];
\&    Algorithm::Diff::diff( $array1, $array2 );
.Ve
.PP
everything would work out \s-1OK \s0(each of the objects would be converted
into a string like \*(L"Person=HASH(0x82425b0)\*(R" for comparison).
.PP
But if you did this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $array1 = [ $person1, $person2, $person4 ];
\&    my $array2 = [ $person1, $person3, $person4\->clone(), $person5 ];
\&    Algorithm::Diff::diff( $array1, $array2 );
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW$person4\fR and \f(CW$person4\fR\->\fIclone()\fR (which have the same name and \s-1SSN\s0)
would be seen as different objects. If you wanted them to be considered
equivalent, you would have to pass in a key generation function:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $array1 = [ $person1, $person2, $person4 ];
\&    my $array2 = [ $person1, $person3, $person4\->clone(), $person5 ];
\&    Algorithm::Diff::diff( $array1, $array2, \e&Person::hash );
.Ve
.PP
This would use the 'ssn' field in each Person as a comparison key, and
so would consider \f(CW$person4\fR and \f(CW$person4\fR\->\fIclone()\fR as equal.
.PP
You may also pass additional parameters to the key generation function
if you wish.

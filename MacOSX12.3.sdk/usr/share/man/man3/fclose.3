.Dt FCLOSE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fclose ,
.Nm fcloseall
.Nd close a stream
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdio.h
.Ft int
.Fn fclose "FILE *stream"
.Ft void
.Fn fcloseall void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fclose
function
dissociates the named
.Fa stream
from its underlying file or set of functions.
If the stream was being used for output, any buffered data is written
first, using
.Xr fflush 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn fcloseall
function calls
.Fn fclose
on all open streams.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise,
.Dv EOF
is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
In either case no further access to the stream is possible.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn fclose
function
may also fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the routines
.Xr close 2
or
.Xr fflush 3 .
.Sh NOTES
The
.Fn fclose
function
does not handle NULL arguments; they will result in a segmentation
violation.
This is intentional - it makes it easier to make sure programs written
under
.Fx
are bug free.
This behaviour is an implementation detail, and programs should not
rely upon it.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr close 2 ,
.Xr fflush 3 ,
.Xr fopen 3 ,
.Xr setbuf 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fclose
function
conforms to
.St -isoC .
.Pp
The
.Fn fcloseall
function first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .

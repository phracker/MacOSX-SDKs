.SH "NAME"
Test2::Util::Grabber \- Object used to temporarily intercept all events.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Once created this object will intercept and stash all events sent to the shared
Test2::Hub object. Once the object is destroyed, events will once
again be sent to the shared hub.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&    use Test2 qw/Core Grab/;
\&
\&    my $grab = grab();
\&
\&    # Generate some events, they are intercepted.
\&    ok(1, "pass");
\&    ok(0, "fail");
\&
\&    my $events_a = $grab\->flush;
\&
\&    # Generate some more events, they are intercepted.
\&    ok(1, "pass");
\&    ok(0, "fail");
\&
\&    # Same as flush, except it destroys the grab object.
\&    my $events_b = $grab\->finish;
.Ve
.PP
After calling \f(CW\*(C`finish()\*(C'\fR the grab object is destroyed and \f(CW$grab\fR is set to
undef. \f(CW$events_a\fR is an arrayref with the first two events. \f(CW$events_b\fR is an
arrayref with the second two events.
.SH "EXPORTS"
.IX Header "EXPORTS"
.ie n .IP "$grab = \fBgrab()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$grab\fR = \fBgrab()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$grab = grab()"
This lets you intercept all events for a section of code without adding
anything to your call stack. This is useful for things that are sensitive to
changes in the stack depth.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    my $grab = grab();
\&        ok(1, \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq);
\&        ok(0, \*(Aqbar\*(Aq);
\&
\&    # $grab is magically undef after this.
\&    my $events = $grab\->finish;
\&
\&    is(@$events, 2, "grabbed two events.");
.Ve
.Sp
When you call \f(CW\*(C`finish()\*(C'\fR the \f(CW$grab\fR object will automagically undef itself,
but only for the reference used in the method call. If you have other
references to the \f(CW$grab\fR object they will not be set to undef.
.Sp
If the \f(CW$grab\fR object is destroyed without calling \f(CW\*(C`finish()\*(C'\fR, it will
automatically clean up after itself and restore the parent hub.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    {
\&        my $grab = grab();
\&        # Things are grabbed
\&    }
\&    # Things are back to normal
.Ve
.Sp
By default the hub used has \f(CW\*(C`no_ending\*(C'\fR set to true. This will prevent the hub
from enforcing that you issued a plan and ran at least one test. You can turn
enforcement back one like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $grab\->hub\->set_no_ending(0);
.Ve
.Sp
With \f(CW\*(C`no_ending\*(C'\fR turned off, \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR will run the post-test checks to
enforce the plan and that tests were run. In many cases this will result in
additional events in your events array.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.ie n .IP "$grab = $class\->\fBnew()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$grab\fR = \f(CW$class\fR\->\fBnew()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$grab = $class->new()"
Create a new grab object, immediately starts intercepting events.
.ie n .IP "$ar = $grab\->\fBflush()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$ar\fR = \f(CW$grab\fR\->\fBflush()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$ar = $grab->flush()"
Get an arrayref of all the events so far, clearing the grab objects internal
list.
.ie n .IP "$ar = $grab\->\fBevents()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$ar\fR = \f(CW$grab\fR\->\fBevents()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$ar = $grab->events()"
Get an arrayref of all events so far. Does not clear the internal list.
.ie n .IP "$ar = $grab\->\fBfinish()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$ar\fR = \f(CW$grab\fR\->\fBfinish()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$ar = $grab->finish()"
Get an arrayref of all the events, then destroy the grab object.
.ie n .IP "$hub = $grab\->\fBhub()\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$hub\fR = \f(CW$grab\fR\->\fBhub()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$hub = $grab->hub()"
Get the hub that is used by the grab event.
.SH "ENDING BEHAVIOR"
.IX Header "ENDING BEHAVIOR"
By default the hub used has \f(CW\*(C`no_ending\*(C'\fR set to true. This will prevent the hub
from enforcing that you issued a plan and ran at least one test. You can turn
enforcement back one like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $grab\->hub\->set_no_ending(0);
.Ve
.PP
With \f(CW\*(C`no_ending\*(C'\fR turned off, \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR will run the post-test checks to
enforce the plan and that tests were run. In many cases this will result in
additional events in your events array.

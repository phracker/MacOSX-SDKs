.Sh NAME
.Nm protocols
.Nd protocol name data base
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm protocols
file contains information regarding the known protocols used in the
.Tn DARPA
Internet.  For each protocol a single line should be present
with the following information:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
official protocol name
protocol number
aliases
.Ed
.Pp
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or
tab characters.  A ``#'' indicates the beginning of
a comment; characters up to the end of the line are
not interpreted by routines which search the file.
.Pp
Protocol names may contain any printable
character other than a field delimiter, newline,
or comment character.
.Sh INTERACTION WITH DIRECTORY SERVICES
Processes generally find protocol records using one of the
.Xr getprotoent 3
family of functions.
On Mac OS X, these functions interact with the
.Xr DirectoryService 8
daemon,
which reads the /etc/protocols file as well as searching other directory information services
to determine protocol name and number information.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/protocols -compact

.Sh NAME
.Nm nsmb.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Tn SMB
requests
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains information about the computers and shares
or mount points for the
.Tn SMB
network protocol.
.Pp
The configuration hierarchy is made up of several sections,
each section containing a few or several lines of parameters
and their assigned values.
Each of these sections must begin with a section name enclosed within
square brackets, similar to:
.Pp
.D1 Bq Ar section_name
.Pp
The end of each section is marked by either the start of a new section,
or by the abrupt ending of the file, commonly referred to as the
.Tn EOF .
Each section may contain zero or more parameters such as:
.Pp
.D1 Bq Ar section_name
.D1 Ar key Ns = Ns Ar value
.Pp
where
.Ar key
represents a parameter name, and
.Ar value
would be the parameter's assigned value.
.Pp
The
.Tn SMB
library uses the following information for section names:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Ic A)
.Bq Li default
.It Ic B)
.Bq Ar SERVER
.It Ic C)
.Op Ar SERVER : Ns Ar SHARE

The minimum authentication level can be one of:
.Bl -tag -width ".Li kerberos"
.It Li kerberos
Kerberos - NTLMv2, NTLM, LM, and plain-text password authentication are
not attempted.
.It Li ntlmv2
NTLMv2 - Kerberos authentication is attempted if a Kerberos token can be
obtained, otherwise NTLMv2 authentication is attempted; if the server
doesn't support encrypted passwords, the authentication fails.
.It Li ntlm
NTLM - Kerberos authentication is attempted if a Kerberos token can be
obtained, otherwise NTLMv2 authentication is attempted and, if that
fails, NTLMv1 authentication is attempted, with zeroes in the LM hash;
if the server doesn't support encrypted passwords, the authentication
fails.
.It Li lm
LM - Kerberos authentication is attempted if a Kerberos token can be
obtained, otherwise NTLMv2 authentication is attempted and, if that
fails, NTLMv1 authentication is attempted, including the LM hash; if the
server doesn't support encrypted passwords, the authentication fails.
.It Li none
none - The same as
.Li lm
except that, if the server doesn't support encrypted passwords,
plain-text passwords are used. Required for servers that don't support extended security.

(Note: "NetBIOS" as used below means "NetBIOS over TCP/IP.")

unsuccessful, try to connect via NetBIOS.
.It Li netbios_only
Do not attempt to connect via port 445.
.It Li no_netbios
Attempt to connect via port 445. If that is 
unsuccessful, do not try to connect via NetBIOS.

The
.Dq Li default
section specifies that only Kerberos and NTLMv2 authentication should be
attempted; NTLM authentication should not be attempted if NTLMv2
authentication fails, and plain-text authentication should not be
attempted if the server doesn't support encrypted passwords.

The original visible value of \f(CW$/\fR is now preserved
when it is set to an invalid value.  Previously if you set \f(CW$/\fR to a reference
to an array, for example, perl would produce a runtime error and not set PL_rs,

.IP "\(bu" 4
Some patterns starting with \f(CW\*(C`/.*..../\*(C'\fR matched against long strings have been
slow since Perl 5.8, and some of the form \f(CW\*(C`/.*..../i\*(C'\fR have been slow since
Perl 5.18.  They are now all fast again.
[perl #123743] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123743>

Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack.  This prevents
infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes rewinding of the stack.

Code like \f(CW\*(C`/$a[/\*(C'\fR used to read the next line of input and treat it as though
it came immediately after the opening bracket.  Some invalid code consequently
would parse and run, but some code caused crashes, so this is now disallowed.

.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
\&\s-1CPAN.\s0

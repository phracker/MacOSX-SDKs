.TH SNMPGETNEXT 1 "04 Mar 2002" V5.6.2.1 "Net-SNMP"
.SH NAME
snmpgetnext - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GETNEXT requests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpgetnext
[COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] AGENT OID [OID]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpget
is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP GETNEXT request to query for
information on a network entity.  One or more object identifiers
(OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.  Each variable
name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables(5) .
For each one, the variable that is lexicographically "next" in the
remote entity's MIB will be returned.
.PP
For example:
.PP
snmpgetnext -c public zeus interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.1
.PP
will retrieve the variable interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2:
.PP
interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2 = softwareLoopback(24)
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
error message will be shown, helping to pinpoint in what way the
request was malformed.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 8
.B -Cf
If
.B -Cf
is
.I not
specified, some applications
.RB ( snmpdelta ", " snmpget ", " snmpgetnext " and " snmpstatus )
will try to fix errors returned by the agent that you were talking to
and resend the request.  The only time this is really useful is if you
specified a OID that didn't exist in your request and you're using
SNMPv1 which requires "all or nothing" kinds of requests.
.PP
In addition to this option,
.B snmpgetnext
takes the common options described in the
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page.
Note that 
.B snmpgetnext
REQUIRES an argument specifying the agent to query
and at least one OID argument, as described there.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
snmpcmd(1), snmpget(1), variables(5).

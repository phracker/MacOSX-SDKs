.TH bitesize.d 1m  "Jun 15, 2005" "version 1.00" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
bitesize.d \- analyse disk I/O size by process. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bitesize.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This produces a report for the size of disk events caused by
processes. These are the disk events sent by the block I/O driver.

If applications must use the disks, we generally prefer they do so
sequentially with large I/O sizes, or larger "bites".

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Sample until Ctrl\-C is hit then print report,
# 
.B bitesize.d
.PP
.SH FIELDS
.TP
PID
process ID
.TP
CMD
command and argument list
.TP
value
size in bytes
.TP
count
number of I/O operations
.PP
.SH NOTES
The application may be requesting smaller sized operations, which
are being rounded up to the nearest sector size or UFS block size.

To analyse what the application is requesting, DTraceToolkit programs
such as Proc/fddist may help.
.PP
.SH DOCUMENTATION
See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the 
Docs directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked
examples with verbose descriptions explaining the output.
.SH EXIT
bitesize.d will sample until Ctrl\-C is hit.

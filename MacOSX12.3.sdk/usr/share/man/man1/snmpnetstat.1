.TH SNMPNETSTAT 1 "20 Jan 2010" V5.6.2.1 "Net-SNMP"
.SH NAME
snmpnetstat \- display networking status and configuration information from a network entity via SNMP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpnetstat
[COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ca] [-Cn] AGENT
.br
.B snmpnetstat
[COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ci] [-Co] [-Cr] [-Cn] [-Cs] AGENT
.br
.B snmpnetstat
[COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ci] [-Cn] [-CI interface] AGENT [interval]
.br
.B snmpnetstat
[COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ca] [-Cn] [-Cs] [-Cp protocol] AGENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B snmpnetstat 
command symbolically displays the values of various network-related
information retrieved from a remote system using the SNMP protocol.
There are a number of output formats,
depending on the options for the information presented.
The first form of the command displays a list of active sockets.
The second form presents the values of other network-related
information according to the option selected.
Using the third form, with an 
.I interval
specified,
.I snmpnetstat
will continuously display the information regarding packet
traffic on the configured network interfaces.
The fourth form displays statistics about the named protocol.
.PP
.B snmpnetstat
will issue GETBULK requests to query for information
if at least protocol version
.I v2
is used.
.PP
AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is
instrumented to monitor the given objects.
At its simplest, the AGENT specification will
consist of a hostname or an IPv4 address. In this
situation, the command will attempt communication
with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of the
given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of
the possible formats for AGENT.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
The options have the following meaning:
.PP
.B COMMON OPTIONS
 Please see
.I snmpcmd(1)
for a list of possible values for common options
as well as their descriptions.
.PP
.B \-Ca
With the default display,
show the state of all sockets; normally sockets used by
server processes are not shown.
.PP
.B \-Ci
Show the state of all of the network interfaces.
The  interface  display  provides  a  table  of cumulative
statistics regarding packets transferred, errors, and collisions.
The  network addresses of the interface and the maximum transmission 
unit (``mtu'') are also displayed.
.PP
.B \-Co
Show an abbreviated interface status, giving octets in place of packets.
This is useful when enquiring virtual interfaces (such as Frame-Relay circuits)
on a router.
.PP
.BI \-CI " interface"
Show information only about this interface;
used with an
.I interval
as described below.
.PP
.B \-Cn
Show network addresses as numbers (normally 
.I snmpnetstat
interprets addresses and attempts to display them
symbolically).
This option may be used with any of the display formats.
.PP
.BI \-Cp " protocol"
Show statistics about 
.IR protocol,
which is either a well-known name for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some
protocol names and aliases are listed in the file 
.IR /etc/protocols .
A null response typically means that there are no interesting numbers to 
report.
The program will complain if
.I protocol
is unknown or if there is no statistics routine for it.
.PP
.B \-Cs
Show per-protocol statistics.  When used with the
.B \-Cr
option, show routing statistics instead.
.PP
.B \-Cr
Show the routing tables.
When
.B \-Cs
is also present, show per-protocol routing statistics instead of 
the routing tables.
.PP
.BI \-CR " repeaters"
For GETBULK requests,
.I repeaters
specifies the max-repeaters value to use.
.PP
When  snmpnetstat is invoked with an interval argument, it
displays a running count of statistics related to  network
interfaces.
.I interval
is the number of seconds between
reporting of statistics.
.PP
.I The Active Sockets Display (default)
.PP
The default display, for active sockets, shows the local
and remote addresses, protocol, and the internal state  of
the   protocol.    Address   formats   are   of  the  form
``host.port'' or ``network.port'' if  a  socket's  address
specifies  a  network  but no specific host address.  When
known, the host and network addresses are displayed symbolically
according   to  the  data  bases 
.I /etc/hosts  and
.IR /etc/networks,
respectively.  If a symbolic  name  for  an
address  is unknown, or if the
.B \-Cn
option is specified, the
address is printed numerically, according to  the  address
family.  For more information regarding the Internet ``dot
format,'' refer  to
.IR inet(3N).
Unspecified,  or  ``wildcard'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.
.PP
.I The Interface Display
.PP
The  interface  display  provides  a  table  of cumulative
statistics regarding packets transferred, errors, and col-
lisions.   The  network addresses of the interface and the
maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also displayed.
.PP
.I The Routing Table Display
.PP
The routing table display indicates the  available  routes
and  their  status.   Each route consists of a destination
host or network and a gateway to use in  forwarding  pack-
ets.   The flags field shows the state of the route (``U''
if ``up''), whether the route is  to  a  gateway  (``G''),
whether  the  route  was created dynamically by a redirect
(``D''), and whether the route  has  been  modified  by  a
redirect  (``M'').   Direct  routes  are  created for each
interface attached to the local host;  the  gateway  field
for  such entries shows the address of the outgoing inter-
face.  The interface entry indicates the network interface
utilized for the route.
.PP
.I The Interface Display with an Interval
.PP
When
.I snmpnetstat
is invoked with an
.I interval
argument, it
displays a running count of statistics related to  network
interfaces.   This  display  consists  of a column for the
primary interface and a column summarizing information for
all  interfaces.   The  primary  interface may be replaced
with another interface with the
.B \-CI
option.  The first line
of each screen of information contains a summary since the
system was last rebooted.  Subsequent lines of output show
values accumulated over the preceding interval.
.PP
.I The Active Sockets Display for a 
.I Single Protocol
.PP
When a protocol is specified with the
.B \-Cp
option, the
information displayed is similar to that in the
default display for active sockets, except the
display is limited to the given protocol.

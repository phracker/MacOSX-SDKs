.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
manages power management settings such as idle sleep timing, wake on administrative access, automatic restart on power loss, etc.
.Pp
Note that processes may dynamically override these power management settings by using
I/O Kit power assertions.
Whenever processes override any system power settings,
.Nm
will list those processes and their power assertions in
.Fl g
and
.Fl g 
assertions. See 
.Xr caffeinate 8 .
.Sh SETTING
.Nm
can modify the values of any of the power management settings defined below. You may specify one or more setting & value pairs on the command-line invocation of pmset.
The
.Fl a,
.Fl b,
.Fl c,
.Fl u
flags determine whether the settings apply to battery (
.Fl b
),
charger (wall power) (
.Fl c
), UPS (
.Fl u
) or all (
.Fl a
).
.Pp
Use a minutes argument of 0 to set the idle time to never for
.Ar sleep
.Ar disksleep
and
.Ar displaysleep
.
.Pp
.Nm
must be run as root in order to modify any settings.

.Sh SAFE SLEEP ARGUMENTS
.Ar hibernatemode
supports values of 0, 3, or 25. Whether or not a hibernation image gets written is also dependent on the values of
.Ar standby
and
.Ar autopoweroff
.Pp
For example, on desktops that support
.Ar standby
a hibernation image will be written after the specified
.Ar standbydelay
time. To disable hibernation images completely, ensure
.Ar hibernatemode
.Ar standby
and
.Ar autopoweroff
are all set to 0.
.Pp
.Ar hibernatemode 
= 0 by default on desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.
.Pp
.Ar hibernatemode 
= 3 by default on portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from hibernate image.
.Pp
.Ar hibernatemode
= 25 is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want "hibernation" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.
.Pp
Please note that
.Ar hibernatefile
may only point to a file located on the root volume.
.Sh STANDBY ARGUMENTS
.Ar standby
causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power while asleep. This setting defaults to
.Ar ON
for supported hardware. The setting
.Ar standby
will be visible in
.Nm
.Fl g
if the feature is supported on this machine.
.Pp
.Ar standbydelayhigh
and
.Ar standbydelaylow
specify the delay, in seconds, before writing the hibernation image to disk and powering off memory for Standby.
.Ar standbydelayhigh
is used when the remaining battery capacity is above
.Ar highstandbythreshold
, and
.Ar standbydelaylow
is used when the remaining battery capacity is below
.Ar highstandbythreshold.
.Pp
.Ar highstandbythreshold
has a default value of 50 percent.
.Pp
.Ar autopoweroff
is enabled by default on supported platforms as an implementation of Lot 6 to the European Energy-related Products Directive. After sleeping for <autopoweroffdelay> seconds, the system will write a hibernation image and go into a lower power chipset sleep. Wakeups from this state will take longer than wakeups from regular sleep.
.Pp
.Ar autopoweroffdelay
specifies the delay, in seconds, before entering autopoweroff mode.
.Sh UPS SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS
.br
UPS-specific arguments are only valid following the 
.Fl u 
option. UPS settings also have an on/off value. Use a -1 argument instead of percent 
or minutes to turn any of these settings off. If multiple halt conditions are specified,
the system will halt on the first condition that occurs in a low power situation.
.Pp
.Ar haltlevel
- when draining UPS battery, battery level at which to trigger an emergency shutdown (value in %)
.br
.Ar haltafter
- when draining UPS battery, trigger emergency shutdown after this long running on UPS power (value in minutes, or 0 to disable)
.br
.Ar haltremain
- when draining UPS battery, trigger emergency shutdown when this much time remaining on UPS power is estimated (value in minutes, or 0 to disable)
.Pp
Note: None of these settings are observed on a system with support for an internal battery, such as a laptop. UPS emergency shutdown settings are for desktop and server only.
.Sh SCHEDULED EVENT ARGUMENTS
.br
pmset allows you to schedule system sleep, shutdown, wakeup and/or power on. "schedule"
is for setting up one-time power events, and "repeat" is for setting up daily/weekly 
power on and power off events. Note that you may only have one pair of repeating events
scheduled - a "power on" event and a "power off" event. For sleep cycling applications,
pmset can schedule a "relative" wakeup or poweron to occur in seconds from the end of system sleep/shutdown,
but this event cannot be cancelled and is inherently imprecise.
.Pp
.Ar type 
- one of sleep, wake, poweron, shutdown, wakeorpoweron
.br
.Ar date/time
- "MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss" (in 24 hour format; must be in quotes)
.br
.Ar time 
- HH:mm:ss
.br
.Ar weekdays
- a subset of MTWRFSU ("M" and "MTWRF" are valid strings)
.br
.Ar owner 
- a string describing the person or program who is scheduling this one-time power event (optional)
.Sh POWER SOURCE ARGUMENTS
.Fl g 
with a 'batt' or 'ps' argument will show the state of all attached power sources.
.Pp
.Fl g 
with a 'pslog' or 'rawlog' argument is normally used for debugging, such as isolating
a problem with an aging battery.
.Sh OTHER ARGUMENTS
.Ar boot 
- tell the kernel that system boot is complete (normally LoginWindow does this). May be useful to Darwin users.
.br
.Ar touch
- PM re-reads existing settings from disk.
.br
.Ar noidle
- pmset prevents idle sleep by creating a PM assertion to prevent idle sleep(while running; hit ctrl-c to cancel). This argument is deprecated in favor of 
.Xr caffeinate 8 . Please use 
.Xr caffeinate 8 instead.
.br
.Ar sleepnow
- causes an immediate system sleep.
.br
.Ar restoredefaults
- Restores Energy Saver settings to their default values. (Like clicking "Restore Defaults" in Energy Saver GUI).
.br
.Ar displaysleepnow
- causes display to go to sleep immediately.
.br
.Ar resetdisplayambientparams
- resets the ambient light parameters for certain Apple displays.
.br
.Ar dim 
- deprecated in 10.4 in favor of 'displaysleep'. 'dim' will continue to work.
.br
.Ar spindown 
- deprecated in 10.4 in favor of 'disksleep'. 'spindown' will continue to work.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This command sets displaysleep to a 5 minute timer on battery power, leaving
other settings on battery power and other power sources unperturbed.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl b
displaysleep 5
.Pp
Sets displaysleep to 10, disksleep to 10, system sleep to 30, and
turns on WakeOnMagicPacket for ALL power sources (AC, Battery, and UPS) as appropriate
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl a
displaysleep 10 disksleep 10 sleep 30 womp 1
.Pp
Restores the system's energy settings to their default values.
.Pp
For a system with an attached and supported UPS, this instructs the system to
perform an emergency shutdown when UPS battery drains to below 40%.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl u
haltlevel 40
.Pp
For a system with an attached and supported UPS, this instructs the system to
perform an emergency shutdown when UPS battery drains to below 25%, or when the
UPS estimates it has less than 30 minutes remaining runtime. The system shuts down
as soon as either of these conditions is met.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl u
haltlevel 25 haltremain 30
.Pp
For a system with an attached and supported UPS, this instructs the system to
perform an emergency shutdown after 2 minutes of running on UPS battery power.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl u
haltafter 2
.Pp
Schedules the system to automatically wake from sleep on July 4, 2016, at 8PM.

batt
.Pp
If your system suddenly sleeps on battery power with 20-50% of capacity remaining, leave this command running in a Terminal window. When you see the problem and later power and wake the
computer, you'll be able to detect sudden discontinuities (like a jump from 30% to 0%) indicative of an aging battery.

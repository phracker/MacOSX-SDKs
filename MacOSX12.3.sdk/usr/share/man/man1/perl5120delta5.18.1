.SH "NAME"
perl5120delta \- what is new for perl v5.12.0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.10.0 release and the
5.12.0 release.
.PP
Many of the bug fixes in 5.12.0 are already included in the 5.10.1
maintenance release.
.PP
You can see the list of those changes in the 5.10.1 release notes
(perl5101delta).
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.ie n .SS "New ""package NAME VERSION"" syntax"
.el .SS "New \f(CWpackage NAME VERSION\fP syntax"
.IX Subsection "New package NAME VERSION syntax"
This new syntax allows a module author to set the \f(CW$VERSION\fR of a namespace
when the namespace is declared with 'package'. It eliminates the need
for \f(CW\*(C`our $VERSION = ...\*(C'\fR and similar constructs. E.g.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&      package Foo::Bar 1.23;
\&      # $Foo::Bar::VERSION == 1.23
.Ve
.PP
There are several advantages to this:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$VERSION\fR is parsed in exactly the same way as \f(CW\*(C`use NAME VERSION\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$VERSION\fR is set at compile time
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$VERSION\fR is a version object that provides proper overloading of
comparison operators so comparing \f(CW$VERSION\fR to decimal (1.23) or
dotted-decimal (v1.2.3) version numbers works correctly.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Eliminates \f(CW\*(C`$VERSION = ...\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eval $VERSION\*(C'\fR clutter
.IP "\(bu" 4
As it requires \s-1VERSION\s0 to be a numeric literal or v\-string
literal, it can be statically parsed by toolchain modules
without \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR the way \s-1MM\-\s0>parse_version does for \f(CW\*(C`$VERSION = ...\*(C'\fR
.PP
It does not break old code with only \f(CW\*(C`package NAME\*(C'\fR, but code that uses
\&\f(CW\*(C`package NAME VERSION\*(C'\fR will need to be restricted to perl 5.12.0 or newer
This is analogous to the change to \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR from two-args to three-args.
Users requiring the latest Perl will benefit, and perhaps after several
years, it will become a standard practice.
.PP
However, \f(CW\*(C`package NAME VERSION\*(C'\fR requires a new, 'strict' version
number format. See \*(L"Version number formats\*(R" for details.
.ie n .SS "The ""..."" operator"
.el .SS "The \f(CW...\fP operator"
.IX Subsection "The ... operator"
A new operator, \f(CW\*(C`...\*(C'\fR, nicknamed the Yada Yada operator, has been added.
It is intended to mark placeholder code that is not yet implemented.
See \*(L"Yada Yada Operator\*(R" in perlop.
.SS "Implicit strictures"
.IX Subsection "Implicit strictures"
Using the \f(CW\*(C`use VERSION\*(C'\fR syntax with a version number greater or equal
to 5.11.0 will lexically enable strictures just like \f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR
would do (in addition to enabling features.) The following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use 5.12.0;
.Ve
.PP
means:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use strict;
\&    use feature \*(Aq:5.12\*(Aq;

.SS "Unicode improvements"
.IX Subsection "Unicode improvements"
Perl 5.12 comes with Unicode 5.2, the latest version available to
us at the time of release.  This version of Unicode was released in
October 2009. See <http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0> for
further details about what's changed in this version of the standard.
See perlunicode for instructions on installing and using other versions
of Unicode.
.PP
Additionally, Perl's developers have significantly improved Perl's Unicode
implementation. For full details, see \*(L"Unicode overhaul\*(R" below.
.SS "Y2038 compliance"
.IX Subsection "Y2038 compliance"
Perl's core time-related functions are now Y2038 compliant. (It may not mean much to you, but your kids will love it!)
.SS "qr overloading"
.IX Subsection "qr overloading"
It is now possible to overload the \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR operator, that is,
conversion to regexp, like it was already possible to overload
conversion to boolean, string or number of objects. It is invoked when
an object appears on the right hand side of the \f(CW\*(C`=~\*(C'\fR operator or when
it is interpolated into a regexp. See overload.
.SS "Pluggable keywords"
.IX Subsection "Pluggable keywords"
Extension modules can now cleanly hook into the Perl parser to define
new kinds of keyword-headed expression and compound statement. The
syntax following the keyword is defined entirely by the extension. This
allows a completely non-Perl sublanguage to be parsed inline, with the
correct ops cleanly generated.
.PP
See \*(L"PL_keyword_plugin\*(R" in perlapi for the mechanism. The Perl core
source distribution also includes a new module
XS::APItest::KeywordRPN, which implements reverse Polish notation
arithmetic via pluggable keywords. This module is mainly used for test
purposes, and is not normally installed, but also serves as an example
of how to use the new mechanism.
.PP
Perl's developers consider this feature to be experimental. We may remove
it or change it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.
.SS "APIs for more internals"
.IX Subsection "APIs for more internals"
The lowest layers of the lexer and parts of the pad system now have C
APIs available to \s-1XS\s0 extensions. These are necessary to support proper
use of pluggable keywords, but have other uses too. The new APIs are
experimental, and only cover a small proportion of what would be
necessary to take full advantage of the core's facilities in these
areas. It is intended that the Perl 5.13 development cycle will see the
addition of a full range of clean, supported interfaces.
.PP
Perl's developers consider this feature to be experimental. We may remove
it or change it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.
.SS "Overridable function lookup"
.IX Subsection "Overridable function lookup"
Where an extension module hooks the creation of rv2cv ops to modify the
subroutine lookup process, this now works correctly for bareword
subroutine calls. This means that prototypes on subroutines referenced
this way will be processed correctly. (Previously bareword subroutine
names were initially looked up, for parsing purposes, by an unhookable
mechanism, so extensions could only properly influence subroutine names
that appeared with an \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR sigil.)
.SS "A proper interface for pluggable Method Resolution Orders"
.IX Subsection "A proper interface for pluggable Method Resolution Orders"
As of Perl 5.12.0 there is a new interface for plugging and using method
resolution orders other than the default linear depth first search.
The C3 method resolution order added in 5.10.0 has been re-implemented as
a plugin, without changing its Perl-space interface. See perlmroapi for
more information.
.ie n .SS """\eN"" experimental regex escape"
.el .SS "\f(CW\eN\fP experimental regex escape"
.IX Subsection "N experimental regex escape"
Perl now supports \f(CW\*(C`\eN\*(C'\fR, a new regex escape which you can think of as
the inverse of \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR. It will match any character that is not a newline,
independently from the presence or absence of the single line match
modifier \f(CW\*(C`/s\*(C'\fR. It is not usable within a character class.  \f(CW\*(C`\eN{3}\*(C'\fR
means to match 3 non-newlines; \f(CW\*(C`\eN{5,}\*(C'\fR means to match at least 5.
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{NAME}\*(C'\fR still means the character or sequence named \f(CW\*(C`NAME\*(C'\fR, but
\&\f(CW\*(C`NAME\*(C'\fR no longer can be things like \f(CW3\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`5,\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This will break a custom charnames translator which allows numbers for character names, as \f(CW\*(C`\eN{3}\*(C'\fR will
now mean to match 3 non-newline characters, and not the character whose
name is \f(CW3\fR. (No name defined by the Unicode standard is a number,
so only custom translators might be affected.)
.PP
Perl's developers are somewhat concerned about possible user confusion
with the existing \f(CW\*(C`\eN{...}\*(C'\fR construct which matches characters by their
Unicode name. Consequently, this feature is experimental. We may remove
it or change it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.
.SS "DTrace support"
.IX Subsection "DTrace support"
Perl now has some support for DTrace. See \*(L"DTrace support\*(R" in \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR.
.ie n .SS "Support for ""configure_requires"" in \s-1CPAN\s0 module metadata"
.el .SS "Support for \f(CWconfigure_requires\fP in \s-1CPAN\s0 module metadata"
.IX Subsection "Support for configure_requires in CPAN module metadata"
Both \f(CW\*(C`CPAN\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`CPANPLUS\*(C'\fR now support the \f(CW\*(C`configure_requires\*(C'\fR
keyword in the \fI\s-1META\s0.yml\fR metadata file included in most recent \s-1CPAN\s0
distributions.  This allows distribution authors to specify configuration
prerequisites that must be installed before running \fIMakefile.PL\fR
or \fIBuild.PL\fR.
.PP
See the documentation for \f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::MakeMaker\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Module::Build\*(C'\fR for
more on how to specify \f(CW\*(C`configure_requires\*(C'\fR when creating a distribution
for \s-1CPAN.\s0
.ie n .SS """each"", ""keys"", ""values"" are now more flexible"

.IX Subsection "Enabling warnings from your shell environment"
You can now set \f(CW\*(C`\-W\*(C'\fR from the \f(CW\*(C`PERL5OPT\*(C'\fR environment variable
.ie n .SS """delete local"""
.el .SS "\f(CWdelete local\fP"
.IX Subsection "delete local"
\&\f(CW\*(C`delete local\*(C'\fR now allows you to locally delete a hash entry.
.SS "New support for Abstract namespace sockets"
.IX Subsection "New support for Abstract namespace sockets"
Abstract namespace sockets are Linux-specific socket type that live in
\&\s-1AF_UNIX\s0 family, slightly abusing it to be able to use arbitrary
character arrays as addresses: They start with nul byte and are not
terminated by nul byte, but with the length passed to the \fIsocket()\fR
system call.
.SS "32\-bit limit on substr arguments removed"
.IX Subsection "32-bit limit on substr arguments removed"
The 32\-bit limit on \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR arguments has now been removed. The full
range of the system's signed and unsigned integers is now available for
the \f(CW\*(C`pos\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`len\*(C'\fR arguments.
.SH "Potentially Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Potentially Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Deprecations warn by default"
.IX Subsection "Deprecations warn by default"
Over the years, Perl's developers have deprecated a number of language
features for a variety of reasons.  Perl now defaults to issuing a
warning if a deprecated language feature is used. Many of the deprecations
Perl now warns you about have been deprecated for many years.  You can
find a list of what was deprecated in a given release of Perl in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl5xxdelta.pod\*(C'\fR file for that release.
.PP
To disable this feature in a given lexical scope, you should use \f(CW\*(C`no
warnings \*(Aqdeprecated\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR For information about which language features
are deprecated and explanations of various deprecation warnings, please
see perldiag. See \*(L"Deprecations\*(R" below for the list of features
and modules Perl's developers have deprecated as part of this release.
.SS "Version number formats"
.IX Subsection "Version number formats"
Acceptable version number formats have been formalized into \*(L"strict\*(R" and
\&\*(L"lax\*(R" rules. \f(CW\*(C`package NAME VERSION\*(C'\fR takes a strict version number.
\&\f(CW\*(C`UNIVERSAL::VERSION\*(C'\fR and the version object constructors take lax
version numbers. Providing an invalid version will result in a fatal
error. The version argument in \f(CW\*(C`use NAME VERSION\*(C'\fR is first parsed as a
numeric literal or v\-string and then passed to \f(CW\*(C`UNIVERSAL::VERSION\*(C'\fR
(and must then pass the \*(L"lax\*(R" format test).
.PP
These formats are documented fully in the version module. To a first
approximation, a \*(L"strict\*(R" version number is a positive decimal number
(integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a
dotted-decimal v\-string with a leading 'v' character and at least three
components. A \*(L"lax\*(R" version number allows v\-strings with fewer than
three components or without a leading 'v'. Under \*(L"lax\*(R" rules, both
decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing \*(L"alpha\*(R"
component separated by an underscore character after a fractional or
dotted-decimal component.
.PP
The version module adds \f(CW\*(C`version::is_strict\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`version::is_lax\*(C'\fR
functions to check a scalar against these rules.
.ie n .SS "@INC reorganization"
.el .SS "\f(CW@INC\fP reorganization"
.IX Subsection "@INC reorganization"
In \f(CW@INC\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ARCHLIB\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PRIVLIB\*(C'\fR now occur after after the current
version's \f(CW\*(C`site_perl\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vendor_perl\*(C'\fR.  Modules installed into
\&\f(CW\*(C`site_perl\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vendor_perl\*(C'\fR will now be loaded in preference to
those installed in \f(CW\*(C`ARCHLIB\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PRIVLIB\*(C'\fR.
.SS "REGEXPs are now first class"
.IX Subsection "REGEXPs are now first class"
Internally, Perl now treats compiled regular expressions (such as
those created with \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR) as first class entities. Perl modules which
serialize, deserialize or otherwise have deep interaction with Perl's
internal data structures need to be updated for this change.  Most
affected \s-1CPAN\s0 modules have already been updated as of this writing.
.SS "Switch statement changes"
.IX Subsection "Switch statement changes"
The \f(CW\*(C`given\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`when\*(C'\fR switch statement handles complex statements better
than Perl 5.10.0 did (These enhancements are also available in
5.10.1 and subsequent 5.10 releases.) There are two new cases where
\&\f(CW\*(C`when\*(C'\fR now interprets its argument as a boolean, instead of an
expression to be used in a smart match:
.IP "flip-flop operators" 4
.IX Item "flip-flop operators"
The \f(CW\*(C`..\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`...\*(C'\fR flip-flop operators are now evaluated in boolean
context, following their usual semantics; see \*(L"Range Operators\*(R" in perlop.
.Sp
Note that, as in perl 5.10.0, \f(CW\*(C`when (1..10)\*(C'\fR will not work to test
whether a given value is an integer between 1 and 10; you should use
\&\f(CW\*(C`when ([1..10])\*(C'\fR instead (note the array reference).
.Sp
However, contrary to 5.10.0, evaluating the flip-flop operators in
boolean context ensures it can now be useful in a \f(CW\*(C`when()\*(C'\fR, notably
for implementing bistable conditions, like in:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) {
\&      # do something
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "defined-or operator" 4
.IX Item "defined-or operator"
A compound expression involving the defined-or operator, as in
\&\f(CW\*(C`when (expr1 // expr2)\*(C'\fR, will be treated as boolean if the first
expression is boolean. (This just extends the existing rule that applies
to the regular or operator, as in \f(CW\*(C`when (expr1 || expr2)\*(C'\fR.)
.SS "Smart match changes"
.IX Subsection "Smart match changes"
Since Perl 5.10.0, Perl's developers have made a number of changes to
the smart match operator. These, of course, also alter the behaviour
of the switch statements where smart matching is implicitly used.
These changes were also made for the 5.10.1 release, and will remain in
subsequent 5.10 releases.
.PP
\fIChanges to type-based dispatch\fR
.IX Subsection "Changes to type-based dispatch"
.PP
The smart match operator \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR is no longer commutative. The behaviour of
a smart match now depends primarily on the type of its right hand
argument. Moreover, its semantics have been adjusted for greater
consistency or usefulness in several cases. While the general backwards
compatibility is maintained, several changes must be noted:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Code references with an empty prototype are no longer treated specially.
They are passed an argument like the other code references (even if they
choose to ignore it).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`%hash ~~ sub {}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`@array ~~ sub {}\*(C'\fR now test that the subroutine
returns a true value for each key of the hash (or element of the
array), instead of passing the whole hash or array as a reference to
the subroutine.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Due to the commutativity breakage, code references are no longer
treated specially when appearing on the left of the \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR operator,
but like any vulgar scalar.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef ~~ %hash\*(C'\fR is always false (since \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR can't be a key in a
hash). No implicit conversion to \f(CW""\fR is done (as was the case in perl
5.10.0).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`$scalar ~~ @array\*(C'\fR now always distributes the smart match across the
elements of the array. It's true if one element in \f(CW@array\fR verifies
\&\f(CW\*(C`$scalar ~~ $element\*(C'\fR. This is a generalization of the old behaviour
that tested whether the array contained the scalar.
.PP
The full dispatch table for the smart match operator is given in
\&\*(L"Smart matching in detail\*(R" in perlsyn.
.PP
\fISmart match and overloading\fR
.IX Subsection "Smart match and overloading"
.PP
According to the rule of dispatch based on the rightmost argument type,
when an object overloading \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR appears on the right side of the
operator, the overload routine will always be called (with a 3rd argument
set to a true value, see overload.) However, when the object will
appear on the left, the overload routine will be called only when the
rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way, distributivity of smart
match across arrays is not broken, as well as the other behaviours with
complex types (coderefs, hashes, regexes). Thus, writers of overloading
routines for smart match mostly need to worry only with comparing
against a scalar, and possibly with stringification overloading; the
other common cases will be automatically handled consistently.
.PP

.SH "Deprecations"
.IX Header "Deprecations"
From time to time, Perl's developers find it necessary to deprecate
features or modules we've previously shipped as part of the core
distribution. We are well aware of the pain and frustration that a
backwards-incompatible change to Perl can cause for developers building
or maintaining software in Perl. You can be sure that when we deprecate
a functionality or syntax, it isn't a choice we make lightly. Sometimes,
we choose to deprecate functionality or syntax because it was found to
be poorly designed or implemented. Sometimes, this is because they're
holding back other features or causing performance problems. Sometimes,
the reasons are more complex. Wherever possible, we try to keep deprecated
functionality available to developers in its previous form for at least
one major release. So long as a deprecated feature isn't actively
disrupting our ability to maintain and extend Perl, we'll try to leave
it in place as long as possible.
.PP
The following items are now deprecated:
.IP "suidperl" 4
.IX Item "suidperl"
\&\f(CW\*(C`suidperl\*(C'\fR is no longer part of Perl. It used to provide a mechanism to
emulate setuid permission bits on systems that don't support it properly.
.ie n .IP "Use of "":="" to mean an empty attribute list" 4
.el .IP "Use of \f(CW:=\fR to mean an empty attribute list" 4
.IX Item "Use of := to mean an empty attribute list"
An accident of Perl's parser meant that these constructions were all
equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    my $pi := 4;
\&    my $pi : = 4;
\&    my $pi :  = 4;
.Ve
.Sp
with the \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR being treated as the start of an attribute list, which
ends before the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR. As whitespace is not significant here, all are
parsed as an empty attribute list, hence all the above are equivalent
to, and better written as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $pi = 4;
.Ve
.Sp
because no attribute processing is done for an empty list.
.Sp
As is, this meant that \f(CW\*(C`:=\*(C'\fR cannot be used as a new token, without
silently changing the meaning of existing code. Hence that particular
form is now deprecated, and will become a syntax error. If it is
absolutely necessary to have empty attribute lists (for example,
because of a code generator) then avoid the warning by adding a space
before the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP """UNIVERSAL\->import()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWUNIVERSAL\->import()\fR" 4
.IX Item "UNIVERSAL->import()"
The method \f(CW\*(C`UNIVERSAL\->import()\*(C'\fR is now deprecated. Attempting to
pass import arguments to a \f(CW\*(C`use UNIVERSAL\*(C'\fR statement will result in a
deprecation warning.
.ie n .IP "Use of ""goto"" to jump into a construct" 4
.el .IP "Use of ``goto'' to jump into a construct" 4
.IX Item "Use of goto to jump into a construct"
Using \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR to jump from an outer scope into an inner scope is now
deprecated. This rare use case was causing problems in the
implementation of scopes.
.IP "Custom character names in \eN{name} that don't look like names" 4
.IX Item "Custom character names in N{name} that don't look like names"
In \f(CW\*(C`\eN{\f(CIname\f(CW}\*(C'\fR, \fIname\fR can be just about anything. The standard
Unicode names have a very limited domain, but a custom name translator
could create names that are, for example, made up entirely of punctuation
symbols. It is now deprecated to make names that don't begin with an
alphabetic character, and aren't alphanumeric or contain other than
a very few other characters, namely spaces, dashes, parentheses
and colons. Because of the added meaning of \f(CW\*(C`\eN\*(C'\fR (See "\f(CW\*(C`\eN\*(C'\fR
experimental regex escape"), names that look like curly brace \-enclosed
quantifiers won't work. For example, \f(CW\*(C`\eN{3,4}\*(C'\fR now means to match 3 to
4 non-newlines; before a custom name \f(CW\*(C`3,4\*(C'\fR could have been created.
.IP "Deprecated Modules" 4
.IX Item "Deprecated Modules"
The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and should be installed from \s-1CPAN\s0 instead. Distributions
on \s-1CPAN\s0 which require these should add them to their prerequisites. The
core versions of these modules warnings will issue a deprecation warning.
.Sp
If you ship a packaged version of Perl, either alone or as part of a
larger system, then you should carefully consider the repercussions of
core module deprecations. You may want to consider shipping your default
build of Perl with packages for some or all deprecated modules which
install into \f(CW\*(C`vendor\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`site\*(C'\fR perl library directories. This will
inhibit the deprecation warnings.
.Sp
Alternatively, you may want to consider patching \fIlib/deprecate.pm\fR
to provide deprecation warnings specific to your packaging system
or distribution of Perl, consistent with how your packaging system
or distribution manages a staged transition from a release where the
installation of a single package provides the given functionality, to
a later release where the system administrator needs to know to install
multiple packages to get that same functionality.
.Sp
You can silence these deprecation warnings by installing the modules
in question from \s-1CPAN. \s0 To install the latest version of all of them,
just install \f(CW\*(C`Task::Deprecations::5_12\*(C'\fR.

intended to remove these libraries from Perl's core for the 5.14.0 release.
.Sp
During final testing before the release of 5.12.0, several developers
discovered current production code using these ancient libraries, some
inside the Perl core itself.  Accordingly, the pumpking granted them
a stay of execution. They will begin to warn about their deprecation
in the 5.14.0 release and will be removed in the 5.16.0 release.
.SH "Unicode overhaul"
.IX Header "Unicode overhaul"
Perl's developers have made a concerted effort to update Perl to be in
sync with the latest Unicode standard. Changes for this include:
.PP
Perl can now handle every Unicode character property. New documentation,
perluniprops, lists all available non-Unihan character properties. By
default, perl does not expose Unihan, deprecated or Unicode-internal
properties.  See below for more details on these; there is also a section
in the pod listing them, and explaining why they are not exposed.
.PP
Perl now fully supports the Unicode compound-style of using \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR in writing regular expressions: \f(CW\*(C`\ep{property=value}\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{property:value}\*(C'\fR (both of which mean the same thing).
.PP
Perl now fully supports the Unicode loose matching rules for text between
the braces in \f(CW\*(C`\ep{...}\*(C'\fR constructs. In addition, Perl allows underscores
between digits of numbers.
.PP
Perl now accepts all the Unicode-defined synonyms for properties and
property values.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`qr/\eX/\*(C'\fR, which matches a Unicode logical character, has
been expanded to work better with various Asian languages. It
now is defined as an \fIextended grapheme cluster\fR. (See
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/>).  Anything matched previously
and that made sense will continue to be accepted.   Additionally:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eX\*(C'\fR will not break apart a \f(CW\*(C`CR\ LF\*(C'\fR sequence.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eX\*(C'\fR will now match a sequence which includes the \f(CW\*(C`ZWJ\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ZWNJ\*(C'\fR
characters.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eX\*(C'\fR will now always match at least one character, including an initial
mark.  Marks generally come after a base character, but it is possible in
Unicode to have them in isolation, and \f(CW\*(C`\eX\*(C'\fR will now handle that case,
for example at the beginning of a line, or after a \f(CW\*(C`ZWSP\*(C'\fR. And this is
the part where \f(CW\*(C`\eX\*(C'\fR doesn't match the things that it used to that don't
make sense. Formerly, for example, you could have the nonsensical case
of an accented \s-1LF.\s0
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eX\*(C'\fR will now match a (Korean) Hangul syllable sequence, and the Thai
and Lao exception cases.
.PP
Otherwise, this change should be transparent for the non-affected
languages.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{...}\*(C'\fR matches using the Canonical_Combining_Class property were
completely broken in previous releases of Perl.  They should now work
correctly.
.PP
Before Perl 5.12, the Unicode \f(CW\*(C`Decomposition_Type=Compat\*(C'\fR property
and a Perl extension had the same name, which led to neither matching
all the correct values (with more than 100 mistakes in one, and several
thousand in the other). The Perl extension has now been renamed to be
\&\f(CW\*(C`Decomposition_Type=Noncanonical\*(C'\fR (short: \f(CW\*(C`dt=noncanon\*(C'\fR). It has the
same meaning as was previously intended, namely the union of all the
non-canonical Decomposition types, with Unicode \f(CW\*(C`Compat\*(C'\fR being just
one of those.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{Decomposition_Type=Canonical}\*(C'\fR now includes the Hangul syllables.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{Uppercase}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Lowercase}\*(C'\fR now work as the Unicode standard
says they should.  This means they each match a few more characters than
they used to.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{Cntrl}\*(C'\fR now matches the same characters as \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Control}\*(C'\fR. This
means it no longer will match Private Use (gc=co), Surrogates (gc=cs),
nor Format (gc=cf) code points. The Format code points represent the
biggest possible problem. All but 36 of them are either officially
deprecated or strongly discouraged from being used. Of those 36, likely
the most widely used are the soft hyphen (U+00AD), and \s-1BOM, ZWSP, ZWNJ,
WJ,\s0 and similar characters, plus bidirectional controls.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{Alpha}\*(C'\fR now matches the same characters as \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Alphabetic}\*(C'\fR. Before
5.12, Perl's definition definition included a number of things that aren't
really alpha (all marks) while omitting many that were. The definitions
of \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Alnum}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Word}\*(C'\fR depend on Alpha's definition and have
changed accordingly.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{Word}\*(C'\fR no longer incorrectly matches non-word characters such
as fractions.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{Print}\*(C'\fR no longer matches the line control characters: Tab, \s-1LF,
CR, FF, VT,\s0 and \s-1NEL.\s0 This brings it in line with standards and the
documentation.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{XDigit}\*(C'\fR now matches the same characters as \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Hex_Digit}\*(C'\fR. This
means that in addition to the characters it currently matches,
\&\f(CW\*(C`[A\-Fa\-f0\-9]\*(C'\fR, it will also match the 22 fullwidth equivalents, for
example U+FF10: \s-1FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO.\s0
.PP
The Numeric type property has been extended to include the Unihan
characters.
.PP
There is a new Perl extension, the 'Present_In', or simply 'In',
property. This is an extension of the Unicode Age property, but
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{In=5.0}\*(C'\fR matches any code point whose usage has been determined
\&\fIas of\fR Unicode version 5.0. The \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Age=5.0}\*(C'\fR only matches code points
added in \fIprecisely\fR version 5.0.
.PP
A number of properties now have the correct values for unassigned
code points. The affected properties are Bidi_Class, East_Asian_Width,
Joining_Type, Decomposition_Type, Hangul_Syllable_Type, Numeric_Type,
and Line_Break.
.PP
The Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, ID_Continue, and ID_Start properties
are now up to date with current Unicode definitions.
.PP
Earlier versions of Perl erroneously exposed certain properties that
are supposed to be Unicode internal-only.  Use of these in regular
expressions will now generate, if enabled, a deprecation warning message.
The properties are: Other_Alphabetic, Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point,
Other_Grapheme_Extend, Other_ID_Continue, Other_ID_Start, Other_Lowercase,
Other_Math, and Other_Uppercase.
.PP
It is now possible to change which Unicode properties Perl understands
on a per-installation basis. As mentioned above, certain properties
are turned off by default.  These include all the Unihan properties
(which should be accessible via the \s-1CPAN\s0 module Unicode::Unihan) and any
deprecated or Unicode internal-only property that Perl has never exposed.
.PP
The generated files in the \f(CW\*(C`lib/unicore/To\*(C'\fR directory are now more
clearly marked as being stable, directly usable by applications.  New hash
entries in them give the format of the normal entries, which allows for
easier machine parsing. Perl can generate files in this directory for
any property, though most are suppressed.  You can find instructions
for changing which are written in perluniprops.

The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on
Unix-like platforms. Instead of running \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR, set \f(CW\*(C`TEST_JOBS\*(C'\fR in
your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run

.Sp

An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make itself, because
TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting test
scripts itself, and there is no standard interface to \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR utilities to
interact with their job schedulers.

Perl 5.12 supports Windows 2000 and later. The supporting code for
legacy versions of Windows is still included, but will be removed
during the next development cycle.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Initial support for building Perl with MinGW\-w64 is now available.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIperl.exe\fR now includes a manifest resource to specify the \f(CW\*(C`trustInfo\*(C'\fR
settings for Windows Vista and later. Without this setting Windows
would treat \fIperl.exe\fR as a legacy application and apply various
heuristics like redirecting access to protected file system areas
(like the \*(L"Program Files\*(R" folder) to the users \*(L"VirtualStore\*(R"
instead of generating a proper \*(L"permission denied\*(R" error.
.Sp
The manifest resource also requests the Microsoft Common-Controls
version 6.0 (themed controls introduced in Windows \s-1XP\s0).  Check out the
Win32::VisualStyles module on \s-1CPAN\s0 to switch back to old style
unthemed controls for legacy applications.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR filetest operator now only returns true if the filehandle
is connected to a console window.  In previous versions of Perl it
would return true for all character mode devices, including \fI\s-1NUL\s0\fR
and \fI\s-1LPT1\s0\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR filetest operator now works correctly, and the
Fcntl::S_IFIFO constant is defined when Perl is compiled with
Microsoft Visual C.  In previous Perl versions \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR always
returned a false value, and the Fcntl::S_IFIFO constant
was not defined.
.Sp
This bug is specific to Microsoft Visual C and never affected
Perl binaries built with MinGW.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The socket error codes are now more widely supported:  The \s-1POSIX\s0
module will define the symbolic names, like \s-1POSIX::EWOULDBLOCK,\s0
and stringification of socket error codes in $! works as well
now;
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  C:\e>perl \-MPOSIX \-E "$!=POSIX::EWOULDBLOCK; say $!"
\&  A non\-blocking socket operation could not be completed immediately.
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIflock()\fR will now set sensible error codes in $!.  Previous Perl versions
copied the value of $^E into $!, which caused much confusion.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIselect()\fR now supports all empty \f(CW\*(C`fd_set\*(C'\fRs more correctly.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(Aq.\efoo\*(Aq\fR and \f(CW\*(Aq..\efoo\*(Aq\fR  were treated differently than

Improved message window handling means that \f(CW\*(C`alarm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`kill\*(C'\fR messages

This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions
from either 5.10.x or 5.8.x.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Some \s-1CPANPLUS\s0 tests may fail if there is a functioning file
\&\fI../../cpanp\-run\-perl\fR outside your build directory. The failure
shouldn't imply there's a problem with the actual functional
software. The bug is already fixed in [\s-1RT\s0 #74188] and is scheduled for
inclusion in perl\-v5.12.1.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`List::Util::first\*(C'\fR misbehaves in the presence of a lexical \f(CW$_\fR
(typically introduced by \f(CW\*(C`my $_\*(C'\fR or implicitly by \f(CW\*(C`given\*(C'\fR). The variable
which gets set for each iteration is the package variable \f(CW$_\fR, not the
lexical \f(CW$_\fR [\s-1RT\s0 #67694].

take a block as their first argument, like

This one is actually a change introduced in 5.10.0, but it was missed

A bugfix related to the handling of the \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR modifier and \f(CW\*(C`qr\*(C'\fR resulted

This is woefully incomplete as it's automatically generated from version
control history.  In particular, it doesn't include the names of the
(very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues in previous
versions of Perl that helped make Perl 5.12.0 better. For a more complete
list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the \f(CW\*(C`AUTHORS\*(C'\fR
file in the Perl 5.12.0 distribution.
.PP
Our \*(L"retired\*(R" pumpkings Nicholas Clark and Rafael Garcia-Suarez
deserve special thanks for their brilliant and substantive ongoing
contributions. Nicholas personally authored over 30% of the patches
since 5.10.0. Rafael comes in second in patch authorship with 11%,
but is first by a long shot in committing patches authored by others,
pushing 44% of the commits since 5.10.0 in this category, often after
providing considerable coaching to the patch authors. These statistics
in no way comprise all of their contributions, but express in shorthand
that we couldn't have done it without them.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the \fBperlbug\fR
program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analyzed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently

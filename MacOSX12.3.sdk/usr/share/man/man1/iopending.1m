.TH iopending 1m  "Nov 01, 2005" "version 0.60" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
iopending \- plot number of pending disk events. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iopending
[\-c] [\-d device] [\-f filename] [\-m mount_point] [interval [count]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This samples the number of disk events that are pending and plots a
distribution graph. By doing this the
"serialness" or "parallelness" of disk behaviour can be distinguished.
A high occurance of a pending value of more than 1 is an indication of
saturation.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

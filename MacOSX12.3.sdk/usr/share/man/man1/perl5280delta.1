.SS "Mixed Unicode scripts are now detectable"
.IX Subsection "Mixed Unicode scripts are now detectable"
A mixture of scripts, such as Cyrillic and Latin, in a string is often
the sign of a spoofing attack.  A new regular expression construct
now allows for easy detection of these.  For example, you can say
.PP
.Vb 1
\& qr/(*script_run: \ed+ \eb )/x
.Ve
.PP
And the digits matched will all be from the same set of 10.  You won't
get a look-alike digit from a different script that has a different
value than what it appears to be.
.PP
Or:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& qr/(*sr: \eb \ew+ \eb )/x
.Ve
.PP
makes sure that all the characters come from the same script.
.PP
You can also combine script runs with \f(CW\*(C`(?>...)\*(C'\fR (or
\&\f(CW\*(C`*atomic:...)\*(C'\fR).
.PP
Instead of writing:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    (*sr:(?<...))
.Ve
.PP
you can now run:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    (*asr:...)
\&    # or
\&    (*atomic_script_run:...)
.Ve
.PP
This is considered experimental, so using it will raise (unless turned
off) a warning in the \f(CW\*(C`experimental::script_run\*(C'\fR category.
.PP
See \*(L"Script Runs\*(R" in perlre.
.ie n .SS "In-place editing with ""perl \-i"" is now safer"
.el .SS "In-place editing with \f(CWperl \-i\fP is now safer"
.IX Subsection "In-place editing with perl -i is now safer"
Previously in-place editing (\f(CW\*(C`perl \-i\*(C'\fR) would delete or rename the
input file as soon as you started working on a new file.
.PP
Without backups this would result in loss of data if there was an
error, such as a full disk, when writing to the output file.
.PP
This has changed so that the input file isn't replaced until the
output file has been completely written and successfully closed.
.PP
This works by creating a work file in the same directory, which is
renamed over the input file once the output file is complete.
.PP
Incompatibilities:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Since this renaming needs to only happen once, if you create a thread
or child process, that renaming will only happen in the original
thread or process.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you change directories while processing a file, and your operating
system doesn't provide the \f(CW\*(C`unlinkat()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`renameat()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`fchmodat()\*(C'\fR
functions, the final rename step may fail.

.SS "Initialisation of aggregate state variables"
.IX Subsection "Initialisation of aggregate state variables"
A persistent lexical array or hash variable can now be initialized,
by an expression such as \f(CW\*(C`state @a = qw(x y z)\*(C'\fR.  Initialization of a
list of persistent lexical variables is still not possible.
.SS "Full-size inode numbers"
.IX Subsection "Full-size inode numbers"
On platforms where inode numbers are of a type larger than perl's native
integer numerical types, stat will preserve the full
content of large inode numbers by returning them in the form of strings of
decimal digits.  Exact comparison of inode numbers can thus be achieved by
comparing with \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR rather than \f(CW\*(C`==\*(C'\fR.  Comparison with \f(CW\*(C`==\*(C'\fR, and other
numerical operations (which are usually meaningless on inode numbers),
work as well as they did before, which is to say they fall back to
floating point, and ultimately operate on a fairly useless rounded inode
number if the real inode number is too big for the floating point format.
.ie n .SS "The ""sprintf"" %j format size modifier is now available with pre\-C99 compilers"
.el .SS "The \f(CWsprintf\fP \f(CW%j\fP format size modifier is now available with pre\-C99 compilers"
.IX Subsection "The sprintf %j format size modifier is now available with pre-C99 compilers"
The actual size used depends on the platform, so remains unportable.
.SS "Close-on-exec flag set atomically"
.IX Subsection "Close-on-exec flag set atomically"
When opening a file descriptor, perl now generally opens it with its
close-on-exec flag already set, on platforms that support doing so.
This improves thread safety, because it means that an \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR initiated
by one thread can no longer cause a file descriptor in the process
of being opened by another thread to be accidentally passed to the
executed program.
.PP
Additionally, perl now sets the close-on-exec flag more reliably, whether
it does so atomically or not.  Most file descriptors were getting the
flag set, but some were being missed.
.SS "String\- and number-specific bitwise ops are no longer experimental"
.IX Subsection "String- and number-specific bitwise ops are no longer experimental"
The new string-specific (\f(CW\*(C`&. |. ^. ~.\*(C'\fR) and number-specific (\f(CW\*(C`& | ^ ~\*(C'\fR)
bitwise operators introduced in Perl 5.22 that are available within the
scope of \f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqbitwise\*(Aq\*(C'\fR are no longer experimental.
Because the number-specific ops are spelled the same way as the existing
operators that choose their behaviour based on their operands, these
operators must still be enabled via the \*(L"bitwise\*(R" feature, in either of
these two ways:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use feature "bitwise";
\&
\&    use v5.28; # "bitwise" now included
.Ve
.PP
They are also now enabled by the \fB\-E\fR command-line switch.
.PP
The \*(L"bitwise\*(R" feature no longer emits a warning.  Existing code that
disables the \*(L"experimental::bitwise\*(R" warning category that the feature
previously used will continue to work.
.PP
One caveat that module authors ought to be aware of is that the numeric
operators now pass a fifth \s-1TRUE\s0 argument to overload methods.  Any methods
that check the number of operands may croak if they do not expect so many.
\&\s-1XS\s0 authors in particular should be aware that this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    SV *
\&    bitop_handler (lobj, robj, swap)
.Ve
.PP
may need to be changed to this:
.PP
.Vb 2

\&    bitop_handler (lobj, robj, swap, ...)
.Ve
.SS "Locales are now thread-safe on systems that support them"
.IX Subsection "Locales are now thread-safe on systems that support them"
These systems include Windows starting with Visual Studio 2005, and in
\&\s-1POSIX 2008\s0 systems.
.PP
The implication is that you are now free to use locales and change them
in a threaded environment.  Your changes affect only your thread.
See \*(L"Multi-threaded operation\*(R" in perllocale
.ie n .SS "New read-only predefined variable ""${^SAFE_LOCALES}"""
.el .SS "New read-only predefined variable \f(CW${^SAFE_LOCALES}\fP"
.IX Subsection "New read-only predefined variable ${^SAFE_LOCALES}"
This variable is 1 if the Perl interpreter is operating in an
environment where it is safe to use and change locales (see
perllocale.)  This variable is true when the perl is
unthreaded, or compiled in a platform that supports thread-safe locale
operation (see previous item).

.SS "Default Hash Function Change"
.IX Subsection "Default Hash Function Change"
Perl 5.28.0 retires various older hash functions which are not viewed as
sufficiently secure for use in Perl. We now support four general purpose
hash functions, Siphash (2\-4 and 1\-3 variants), and  Zaphod32, and StadtX
hash. In addition we support \s-1SBOX32\s0 (a form of tabular hashing) for hashing
short strings, in conjunction with any of the other hash functions provided.
.PP
By default Perl is configured to support \s-1SBOX\s0 hashing of strings up to 24
characters, in conjunction with StadtX hashing on 64 bit builds, and
Zaphod32 hashing for 32 bit builds.
.PP
You may control these settings with the following options to Configure:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    \-DPERL_HASH_FUNC_SIPHASH
\&    \-DPERL_HASH_FUNC_SIPHASH13
\&    \-DPERL_HASH_FUNC_STADTX
\&    \-DPERL_HASH_FUNC_ZAPHOD32
.Ve
.PP
To disable \s-1SBOX\s0 hashing you can use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \-DPERL_HASH_USE_SBOX32_ALSO=0
.Ve
.PP
And to set the maximum length to use \s-1SBOX32\s0 hashing on with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \-DSBOX32_MAX_LEN=16
.Ve
.PP
The maximum length allowed is 256. There probably isn't much point
in setting it higher than the default.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"

.SS "Subroutine attribute and signature order"
.IX Subsection "Subroutine attribute and signature order"
The experimental subroutine signatures feature has been changed so that
subroutine attributes must now come before the signature rather than
after. This is because attributes like \f(CW\*(C`:lvalue\*(C'\fR can affect the
compilation of code within the signature, for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    sub f :lvalue ($a = do { $x = "abc"; return substr($x,0,1)}) { ...}
.Ve
.PP
Note that this the second time they have been flipped:

.SS "Yada-yada is now strictly a statement"
.IX Subsection "Yada-yada is now strictly a statement"
By the time of its initial stable release in Perl 5.12, the \f(CW\*(C`...\*(C'\fR
(yada-yada) operator was explicitly intended to serve as a statement,
not an expression.  However, the original implementation was confused
on this point, leading to inconsistent parsing.  The operator was
accidentally accepted in a few situations where it did not serve as a
complete statement, such as
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    ... . "foo";
\&    ... if $a < $b;
.Ve

The parsing has now been made consistent, permitting yada-yada only as
a statement.  Affected code can use \f(CW\*(C`do{...}\*(C'\fR to put a yada-yada into
an arbitrary expression context.

perl should use to implement the sort builtin.
This was always considered a dubious feature that might not last,
hence the underscore spellings, and they were documented as not being
portable beyond Perl 5.8.  These subpragmata have now been deleted,
and any attempt to use them is an error.  The sort pragma otherwise
remains, and the algorithm-neutral \f(CW\*(C`stable\*(C'\fR subpragma can be used to

accommodate datasets of more than two billion items.

.IX Subsection "Use of vec on strings with code points above 0xFF is deprecated"
Such strings are represented internally in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 and \f(CW\*(C`vec\*(C'\fR is a
bit-oriented operation that will likely give unexpected results on those
strings.

.IX Subsection "Some uses of unescaped ""{"" in regexes are no longer fatal"
Perl 5.26.0 fatalized some uses of an unescaped left brace, but an
exception was made at the last minute, specifically crafted to be a
minimal change to allow \s-1GNU\s0 Autoconf to work.  That tool is heavily
depended upon, and continues to use the deprecated usage.  Its use of an
unescaped left brace is one where we have no intention of repurposing
\&\f(CW"{"\fR to be something other than itself.
.PP
That exception is now generalized to include various other such cases
where the \f(CW"{"\fR will not be repurposed.
.PP
Note that these uses continue to raise a deprecation message.
.ie n .SS "Use of unescaped ""{"" immediately after a ""("" in regular expression patterns is deprecated"
.el .SS "Use of unescaped \f(CW``{''\fP immediately after a \f(CW``(''\fP in regular expression patterns is deprecated"
.IX Subsection "Use of unescaped ""{"" immediately after a ""("" in regular expression patterns is deprecated"
Using unescaped left braces is officially deprecated everywhere, but it
is not enforced in contexts where their use does not interfere with
expected extensions to the language.  A deprecation is added in this
release when the brace appears immediately after an opening parenthesis.
Before this, even if the brace was part of a legal quantifier, it was
not interpreted as such, but as the literal characters, unlike other
quantifiers that follow a \f(CW"("\fR which are considered errors.  Now,
their use will raise a deprecation message, unless turned off.

Assigning a non-zero value to \f(CW$[\fR has been deprecated

now been scheduled for Perl 5.30.

Passing arguments to \f(CW\*(C`Sys::Hostname::hostname()\*(C'\fR was already deprecated,
but didn't have a removal date.  This has now been scheduled for Perl
5.32.  [perl #124349] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124349>
.SS "Module removals"
.IX Subsection "Module removals"
The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from \s-1CPAN.\s0
Distributions on \s-1CPAN\s0 which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.
.PP
The core versions of these modules will now issue \f(CW"deprecated"\fR\-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from \s-1CPAN.\s0
.PP
Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

.IP "\(bu" 4
The start up overhead for creating regular expression patterns with
Unicode properties (\f(CW\*(C`\ep{...}\*(C'\fR) has been greatly reduced in most cases.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Many string concatenation expressions are now considerably faster, due
to the introduction internally of a \f(CW\*(C`multiconcat\*(C'\fR opcode which combines
multiple concatenations, and optionally a \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`.=\*(C'\fR, into a single
action. For example, apart from retrieving \f(CW$s\fR, \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR, this
whole expression is now handled as a single op:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $s .= "a=$a b=$b\en"
.Ve
.Sp
As a special case, if the \s-1LHS\s0 of an assignment is a lexical variable or
\&\f(CW\*(C`my $s\*(C'\fR, the op itself handles retrieving the lexical variable, which
is faster.
.Sp
In general, the more the expression includes a mix of constant strings and
variable expressions, the longer the expression, and the more it mixes
together non\-utf8 and utf8 strings, the more marked the performance
improvement. For example on a \f(CW\*(C`x86_64\*(C'\fR system, this code has been
benchmarked running four times faster:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    my $s;
\&    my $a = "ab\ex{100}cde";
\&    my $b = "fghij";
\&    my $c = "\ex{101}klmn";
\&
\&    for my $i (1..10_000_000) {
\&        $s = "\ex{100}wxyz";
\&        $s .= "foo=$a bar=$b baz=$c";
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
In addition, \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR expressions which have a constant format
containing only \f(CW%s\fR and \f(CW\*(C`%%\*(C'\fR format elements, and which have a fixed
number of arguments, are now also optimised into a \f(CW\*(C`multiconcat\*(C'\fR op.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`ref()\*(C'\fR builtin is now much faster in boolean context, since it no
longer bothers to construct a temporary string like \f(CW\*(C`Foo=ARRAY(0x134af48)\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`keys()\*(C'\fR in void and scalar contexts is now more efficient.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The common idiom of comparing the result of \fBindex()\fR with \-1 is now
specifically optimised,  e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if (index(...) != \-1) { ... }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`for()\*(C'\fR loops and similar constructs are now more efficient in most cases.

.IP "\(bu" 4
The performance of pattern matching \f(CW\*(C`[[:ascii:]]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`[[:^ascii:]]\*(C'\fR
has been improved significantly except on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Various optimizations have been applied to matching regular expression
patterns, so under the right circumstances, significant performance
gains may be noticed.  But in an application with many varied patterns,
little overall improvement likely will be seen.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Other optimizations have been applied to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 handling, but these are
not typically a major factor in most applications.
.SH "Modules and Pragmata"
.IX Header "Modules and Pragmata"
Key highlights in this release across several modules:
.SS "Removal of use vars"
.IX Subsection "Removal of use vars"
The usage of \f(CW\*(C`use vars\*(C'\fR has been discouraged since the introduction of
\&\f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR in Perl 5.6.0. Where possible the usage of this pragma has now been
removed from the Perl source code.
.PP
This had a slight effect (for the better) on the output of \s-1WARNING_BITS\s0 in
B::Deparse.
.SS "Use of DynaLoader changed to XSLoader in many modules"
.IX Subsection "Use of DynaLoader changed to XSLoader in many modules"
XSLoader is more modern, and most modules already require perl 5.6 or
greater, so no functionality is lost by switching. In some cases, we have
also made changes to the local implementation that may not be reflected in
the version on \s-1CPAN\s0 due to a desire to maintain more backwards
compatibility.

Carp, when generating stack traces, now attempts to work around
longstanding bugs resulting from Perl's non-reference-counted stack.
[perl #52610] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=52610>
.Sp
Carp has been modified to avoid assuming that objects cannot be
overloaded without the overload module loaded (this can happen with
objects created by \s-1XS\s0 modules).  Previously, infinite recursion would
result if an XS-defined overload method itself called Carp.
[perl #132828] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132828>
.Sp
Carp now avoids using \f(CW\*(C`overload::StrVal\*(C'\fR, partly because older versions
of overload (included with perl 5.14 and earlier) load Scalar::Util
at run time, which will fail if Carp has been invoked after a syntax error.

.PP
\fIperldiag\fR
.IX Subsection "perldiag"
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\*(L"Variable length lookbehind not implemented in regex m/%s/\*(R" in perldiag
.Sp
This now gives more ideas as to workarounds to the issue that was
introduced in Perl 5.18 (but not documented explicitly in its perldelta)
for the fact that some Unicode \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR rules cause a few sequences such as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& (?<!st)
.Ve
.Sp
to be considered variable length, and hence disallowed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\*(L"Use of state \f(CW$_\fR is experimental\*(R" in perldiag
.Sp
This entry has been removed, as the experimental support of this construct was
removed in perl 5.24.0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The diagnostic \f(CW\*(C`Initialization of state variables in list context
currently forbidden\*(C'\fR has changed to \f(CW\*(C`Initialization of state variables

single aggregate state variables is now permitted.

\fIperlembed\fR
.IX Subsection "perlembed"
.IP "\(bu" 4
The examples in perlembed have been made more portable in the way
they exit, and the example that gets an exit code from the embedded Perl
interpreter now gets it from the right place.  The examples that pass
a constructed argv to Perl now show the mandatory null \f(CW\*(C`argv[argc]\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
An example in perlembed used the string value of \f(CW\*(C`ERRSV\*(C'\fR as a
format string when calling \fBcroak()\fR.  If that string contains format
codes such as \f(CW%s\fR this could crash the program.
.Sp
This has been changed to a call to \fBcroak_sv()\fR.
.Sp
An alternative could have been to supply a trivial format string:
.Sp
.Vb 1

A new flag, \f(CW\*(C`SORTf_UNSTABLE\*(C'\fR, has been added. This will allow a

near the beginning of an \f(CW\*(C`XS\*(C'\fR file, it will be compiled so that
whatever reentrant functions perl knows about on that system will
automatically and invisibly be used instead of the plain, non-reentrant
versions.  For example, if you write \f(CW\*(C`getpwnam()\*(C'\fR in your code, on a
system that has \f(CW\*(C`getpwnam_r()\*(C'\fR all calls to the former will be translated
invisibly into the latter.  This does not happen except on threaded
perls, as they aren't needed otherwise.  Be aware that which functions

A new kind of magic scalar, called a \*(L"nonelem\*(R" scalar, has been introduced.
It is stored in an array to denote a non-existent element, whenever such an
element is accessed in a potential lvalue context.  It replaces the
existing \*(L"defelem\*(R" (deferred element) magic wherever this is possible,
being significantly more efficient.  This means that
\&\f(CW\*(C`some_sub($sparse_array[$nonelem])\*(C'\fR no longer has to create a new magic
defelem scalar each time, as long as the element is within the array.

It partially fixes the rare bug of deferred elements getting out of synch
with their arrays when the array is shifted or unshifted.

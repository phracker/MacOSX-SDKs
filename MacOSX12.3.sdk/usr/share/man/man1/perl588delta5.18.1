Previously when running with warnings enabled globally via \f(CW\*(C`\-w\*(C'\fR, selective
disabling of specific warning categories would actually turn off all warnings.
This is now fixed; now \f(CW\*(C`no warnings \*(Aqio\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR will only turn off warnings in the

.PP
This bug fix may cause some programs to start correctly issuing warnings.
.SS "Remove over-optimisation"
.IX Subsection "Remove over-optimisation"
Perl 5.8.4 introduced a change so that assignments of \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR to a
scalar, or of an empty list to an array or a hash, were optimised away. As
this could cause problems when \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR jumps were involved, this change
has been backed out.

Using the \fIsprintf()\fR function with some formats could lead to a buffer

Operations that require perl to read a process's list of groups, such as reads

this error message makes it easier to diagnose syntax errors.
.SH "Changed Internals"
.IX Header "Changed Internals"
There has been a fair amount of refactoring of the \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR source code, partly to
make it tidier and more maintainable. The resulting object code and the
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR binary may well be smaller than 5.8.7, in particular due to a change
contributed by Dave Mitchell which reworked the warnings code to be
significantly smaller. Apart from being smaller and possibly faster, there
should be no user-detectable changes.
.PP
Andy Lester supplied many improvements to determine which function
parameters and local variables could actually be declared \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR to the C
compiler. Steve Peters provided new \f(CW*_set\fR macros and reworked the core to
use these rather than assigning to macros in \s-1LVALUE\s0 context.
.PP
Dave Mitchell improved the lexer debugging output under \f(CW\*(C`\-DT\*(C'\fR
.PP
Nicholas Clark changed the string buffer allocation so that it is now rounded
up to the next multiple of 4 (or 8 on platforms with 64 bit pointers). This
should reduce the number of calls to \f(CW\*(C`realloc\*(C'\fR without actually using any
extra memory.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`HV\*(C'\fR's array of \f(CW\*(C`HE*\*(C'\fRs is now allocated at the correct (minimal) size,
thanks to another change by Nicholas Clark. Compile with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_USE_LARGE_HV_ALLOC\*(C'\fR to use the old, sloppier, default.
.PP
For \s-1XS\s0 or embedding debugging purposes, if perl is compiled with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS_FORK_DUMP\*(C'\fR in addition to
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS\*(C'\fR then a child process is \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fRed just before
global destruction, which is used to display the values of any scalars
found to have leaked at the end of global destruction. Without this, the
scalars have already been freed sufficiently at the point of detection that
it is impossible to produce any meaningful dump of their contents.  This
feature was implemented by the indefatigable Nicholas Clark, based on an idea
by Mike Giroux.

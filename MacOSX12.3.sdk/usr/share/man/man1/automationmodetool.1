.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm enable-automationmode-without-authentication
.Nm
.Cm disable-automationmode-without-authentication
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to configure a device such that Automation Mode for
UI testing can be enabled without user authentication.
This is useful for configuring machines in continuous integration (CI)
environments as well as those in labs where the active users do
not have administrator privileges. Running the tool for this purpose
requires an administrator to authenticate in the shell.
If no argument is passed, the tool prints the current status of
Automation Mode (enabled or disabled), the authentication configuration
(required or not), and then exits.

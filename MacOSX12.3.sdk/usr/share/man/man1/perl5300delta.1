.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.28.0 release and the 5.30.0
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.0, first read
perl5280delta, which describes differences between 5.26.0 and 5.28.0.

.SH "Core Enhancements"

.SS "Limited variable length lookbehind in regular expression pattern matching is now experimentally supported"
.IX Subsection "Limited variable length lookbehind in regular expression pattern matching is now experimentally supported"
Using a lookbehind assertion (like \f(CW\*(C`(?<=foo?)\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`(?<!ba{1,9}r)\*(C'\fR previously
would generate an error and refuse to compile.  Now it compiles (if the
maximum lookbehind is at most 255 characters), but raises a warning in
the new \f(CW\*(C`experimental::vlb\*(C'\fR warnings category.  This is to caution you
that the precise behavior is subject to change based on feedback from
use in the field.
.PP
See \*(L"(?<=pattern)\*(R" in perlre and \*(L"(?<!pattern)\*(R" in perlre.
.ie n .SS "The upper limit ""n"" specifiable in a regular expression quantifier of the form ""{m,n}"" has been doubled to 65534"
.el .SS "The upper limit \f(CW``n''\fP specifiable in a regular expression quantifier of the form \f(CW``{m,n}''\fP has been doubled to 65534"
.IX Subsection "The upper limit ""n"" specifiable in a regular expression quantifier of the form ""{m,n}"" has been doubled to 65534"
The meaning of an unbounded upper quantifier \f(CW"{m,}"\fR remains unchanged.
It matches 2**31 \- 1 times on most platforms, and more on ones where a C
language short variable is more than 4 bytes long.
.SS "Unicode 12.1 is supported"
.IX Subsection "Unicode 12.1 is supported"
Because of a change in Unicode release cycles, Perl jumps from Unicode
10.0 in Perl 5.28 to Unicode 12.1 in Perl 5.30.
.PP
For details on the Unicode changes, see
<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/> for 11.0;
<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.0.0/> for 12.0;
and
<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/> for 12.1.
(Unicode 12.1 differs from 12.0 only in the addition of a single
character, that for the new Japanese era name.)
.PP
The Word_Break property, as in past Perl releases, remains tailored to
behave more in line with expectations of Perl users.  This means that
sequential runs of horizontal white space characters are not broken
apart, but kept as a single run.  Unicode 11 changed from past versions
to be more in line with Perl, but it left several white space characters
as causing breaks: \s-1TAB, NO BREAK SPACE,\s0 and \s-1FIGURE SPACE\s0 (U+2007).  We
have decided to continue to use the previous Perl tailoring with regards
to these.
.SS "Wildcards in Unicode property value specifications are now partially supported"
.IX Subsection "Wildcards in Unicode property value specifications are now partially supported"
You can now do something like this in a regular expression pattern
.PP
.Vb 1
\& qr! \ep{nv= /(?x) \eA [0\-5] \ez / }!
.Ve
.PP
which matches all Unicode code points whose numeric value is
between 0 and 5 inclusive.  So, it could match the Thai or Bengali
digits whose numeric values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
.PP
This marks another step in implementing the regular expression features
the Unicode Consortium suggests.
.PP
Most properties are supported, with the remainder planned for 5.32.
Details are in \*(L"Wildcards in Property Values\*(R" in perlunicode.
.SS "qr'\eN{name}' is now supported"
.IX Subsection "qr'N{name}' is now supported"
Previously it was an error to evaluate a named character \f(CW\*(C`\eN{...}\*(C'\fR
within a single quoted regular expression pattern (whose evaluation is
deferred from the normal place).  This restriction is now removed.
.SS "Turkic \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales are now seamlessly supported"
.IX Subsection "Turkic UTF-8 locales are now seamlessly supported"
Turkic languages have different casing rules than other languages for
the characters \f(CW"i"\fR and \f(CW"I"\fR.  The uppercase of \f(CW"i"\fR is \s-1LATIN
CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE\s0 (U+0130); and the lowercase of \f(CW"I"\fR is \s-1LATIN
SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I\s0 (U+0131).  Unicode furnishes alternate casing
rules for use with Turkic languages.  Previously, Perl ignored these,
but now, it uses them when it detects that it is operating under a
Turkic \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locale.
.SS "It is now possible to compile perl to always use thread-safe locale operations."
.IX Subsection "It is now possible to compile perl to always use thread-safe locale operations."
Previously, these calls were only used when the perl was compiled to be
multi-threaded.  To always enable them, add
.PP
.Vb 1
\& \-Accflags=\*(Aq\-DUSE_THREAD_SAFE_LOCALE\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
to your \fIConfigure\fR flags.
.SS "Eliminate opASSIGN macro usage from core"
.IX Subsection "Eliminate opASSIGN macro usage from core"
This macro is still defined but no longer used in core
.ie n .SS """\-Drv"" now means something on ""\-DDEBUGGING"" builds"
.el .SS "\f(CW\-Drv\fP now means something on \f(CW\-DDEBUGGING\fP builds"
.IX Subsection "-Drv now means something on -DDEBUGGING builds"
Now, adding the verbose flag (\f(CW\*(C`\-Dv\*(C'\fR) to the \f(CW\*(C`\-Dr\*(C'\fR flag turns on all
possible regular expression debugging.

But to avoid breaking code unnecessarily, most instances that issued a
deprecation warning, remain legal and now have a non-deprecation warning
raised.  See \*(L"Unescaped left braces in regular expressions\*(R" in perldeprecation.
.SS "Previously deprecated \fBsysread()\fP/\fBsyswrite()\fP on :utf8 handles is now fatal"
.IX Subsection "Previously deprecated sysread()/syswrite() on :utf8 handles is now fatal"
Calling \fBsysread()\fR, \fBsyswrite()\fR, \fBsend()\fR or \fBrecv()\fR on a \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR handle,
whether applied explicitly or implicitly, is now fatal.  This was
deprecated in perl 5.24.
.PP
There were two problems with calling these functions on \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR
handles:
.IP "\(bu" 4
All four functions only paid attention to the \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR flag.  Other
layers were completely ignored, so a handle with
\&\f(CW\*(C`:encoding(UTF\-16LE)\*(C'\fR layer would be treated as \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  Other layers,
such as compression are completely ignored with or without the
\&\f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR flag.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBsysread()\fR and \fBrecv()\fR would read from the handle, skipping any
validation by the layers, and do no validation of their own.  This
could lead to invalidly encoded perl scalars.

The \f(CW\*(C`File::Glob::glob()\*(C'\fR function, long deprecated, has been removed and now

It croaks if it would otherwise return a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 string that contains
malformed \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  This protects against potential security threats.  This
is considered a bug fix as well.

.SS "Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another script"
.IX Subsection "Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another script"
There are several sets of digits in the Common script.  \f(CW\*(C`[0\-9]\*(C'\fR is the
most familiar.  But there are also \f(CW\*(C`[\ex{FF10}\-\ex{FF19}]\*(C'\fR (\s-1FULLWIDTH
DIGIT ZERO\s0 \- \s-1FULLWIDTH DIGIT NINE\s0), and several sets for use in
mathematical notation, such as the \s-1MATHEMATICAL\s0 DOUBLE-STRUCK DIGITs.
Any of these sets should be able to appear in script runs of, say,
Greek.  But the design of 5.30 overlooked all but the \s-1ASCII\s0 digits
\&\f(CW\*(C`[0\-9]\*(C'\fR, so the design was flawed.  This has been fixed, so is both a
bug fix and an incompatibility.
[perl #133547] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133547>.
.PP
All digits in a run still have to come from the same set of ten digits.
.SS "\s-1JSON::PP\s0 enables allow_nonref by default"

Translating from \s-1UTF\-8\s0 into the code point it represents now is done via a

can get this speed up, but which ones is complicated and depends on the
underlying bit patterns of those characters, so differs between \s-1ASCII\s0

implicitly by the interpreter.  This modification is permitted by the
C standard, but has only been observed on FreeBSD 13.0\-CURRENT.

Perl now exposes \s-1POSIX\s0 \f(CW\*(C`getcwd\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`Internals::getcwd()\*(C'\fR if
available.  This is intended for use by \f(CW\*(C`Cwd.pm\*(C'\fR during bootstrapping
and may be removed or changed without notice.  This fixes some
bootstrapping issues while building perl in a directory where some
ancestor directory isn't readable.

\&\f(CW\*(C`pack()\*(C'\fR no longer can return malformed \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  It croaks if it would

Regular expression matching no longer leaves stale \s-1UTF\-8\s0 length magic

.IP "\(bu" 4
The handling of user-defined \f(CW\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fR properties (see
\&\*(L"User-Defined Character Properties\*(R" in perlunicode) has been rewritten to
be in C (instead of Perl).  This speeds things up, but in the process
several inconsistencies and bug fixes are made.
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
A few error messages have minor wording changes.  This is essentially
because the new way is integrated into the regex error handling
mechanism that marks the position in the input at which the error
occurred.  That was not possible previously.  The messages now also
contain additional back-trace-like information in case the error occurs
deep in nested calls.
.IP "2." 4
A user-defined property is implemented as a perl subroutine with certain
highly constrained naming conventions.  It was documented previously
that the sub would be in the current package if the package was
unspecified.  This turned out not to be true in all cases, but now it
is.
.IP "3." 4
All recursive calls are treated as infinite recursion.  Previously they
would cause the interpreter to panic.  Now, they cause the regex pattern
to fail to compile.
.IP "4." 4
Similarly, any other error likely would lead to a panic; now to just the
pattern failing to compile.
.IP "5." 4
The old mechanism did not detect illegal ranges in the definition of the
property.  Now, the range max must not be smaller than the range min.
Otherwise, the pattern fails to compile.
.IP "6." 4
The intention was to have each sub called only once during the lifetime
of the program, so that a property's definition is immutable.  This was
relaxed so that it could be called once for all /i compilations, and
potentially a second time for non\-/i (the sub is passed a parameter
indicating which).  However, in practice there were instances when this
was broken, and multiple calls were possible.  Those have been fixed.
Now (besides the /i,non\-/i cases) the only way a sub can be called
multiple times is if some component of it has not been defined yet.  For
example, suppose we have sub \fBIsA()\fR whose definition is known at compile
time, and it in turn calls \fBisB()\fR whose definition is not yet known.
\&\fBisA()\fR will be called each time a pattern it appears in is compiled.  If
\&\fBisA()\fR also calls \fBisC()\fR and that definition is known, \fBisC()\fR will be
called just once.
.IP "7." 4
There were some races and very long hangs should one thread be compiling
the same property as another simultaneously.  These have now been fixed.
.RE
.RS 4

.IP "\(bu" 4
Fixed a failure to match properly.
.Sp
An EXACTFish regnode has a finite length it can hold for the string
being matched.  If that length is exceeded, a second node is used for
the next segment of the string, for as many regnodes as are needed.
Care has to be taken where to break the string, in order to deal
multi-character folds in Unicode correctly. If we want to break a
string at a place which could potentially be in the middle of a
multi-character fold, we back off one (or more) characters, leaving
a shorter EXACTFish regnode. This backing off mechanism contained
an off-by-one error.

A bare \f(CW\*(C`eof\*(C'\fR call with no previous file handle now returns true.
[perl #133721] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133721>
.IP "\(bu" 4
Failing to compile a format now aborts compilation.  Like other errors
in sub-parses this could leave the parser in a strange state, possibly
crashing perl if compilation continued.
[perl #132158] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132158>
.IP "\(bu" 4
If an in-place edit is still in progress during global destruction and
the process exit code (as stored in \f(CW$?\fR) is zero, perl will now
treat the in-place edit as successful, replacing the input file with
any output produced.
.Sp
This allows code like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  perl \-i \-ne \*(Aqprint "Foo"; last\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
to replace the input file, while code like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  perl \-i \-ne \*(Aqprint "Foo"; die\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
will not.  Partly resolves
[perl #133659] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133659>.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A regression in 5.28 caused the following code to fail
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& close(STDIN); open(CHILD, "|wc \-l")\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
because the child's stdin would be closed on exec. This has now been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fixed an issue where compiling a regexp containing both compile-time
and run-time code blocks could lead to trying to compile something
which is invalid syntax.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fixed build failures with \f(CW\*(C`\-DNO_LOCALE_NUMERIC\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-DNO_LOCALE_COLLATE\*(C'\fR.

\&\f(CW\*(C`/di\*(C'\fR nodes ending or beginning in \fIs\fR are now \f(CW\*(C`EXACTF\*(C'\fR. We do not
want two \f(CW\*(C`EXACTFU\*(C'\fR to be joined together during optimization,
and to form a \f(CW\*(C`ss\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sS\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Ss\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`SS\*(C'\fR sequence;
they are the only multi-character sequences which may match differently
under \f(CW\*(C`/ui\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`/di\*(C'\fR.

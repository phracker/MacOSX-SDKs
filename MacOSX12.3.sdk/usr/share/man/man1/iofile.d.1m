.SH NAME
iofile.d \- I/O wait time by file and process. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iofile.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This prints the total I/O wait times for each filename by process.
This can help determine why an application is performing poorly by
identifying which file they are waiting on, and the total times.
Both disk and NFS I/O are measured.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

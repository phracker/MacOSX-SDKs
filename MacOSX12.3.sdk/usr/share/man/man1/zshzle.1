.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the \fBZLE\fP option is set (which it is by default in interactive shells)
and the shell input is attached to the terminal, the user
is able to edit command lines\&.
.PP
There are two display modes\&.  The first, multiline mode, is the
default\&.  It only works if the \fBTERM\fP parameter is set to a valid
terminal type that can move the cursor up\&.  The second, single line
mode, is used if \fBTERM\fP is invalid or incapable of moving the
cursor up, or if the \fBSINGLE_LINE_ZLE\fP option is set\&.
This mode
is similar to \fBksh\fP, and uses no termcap sequences\&.  If \fBTERM\fP is
"emacs", the \fBZLE\fP option will be unset by default\&.
.PP
The parameters \fBBAUD\fP, \fBCOLUMNS\fP, and \fBLINES\fP are also used by the
line editor\&. See
\fIParameters Used By The Shell\fP in \fIzshparam\fP(1)\&.
.PP
The parameter \fBzle_highlight\fP is also used by the line editor; see
\fICharacter Highlighting\fP below\&.  Highlighting
of special characters and the region between the cursor and the
mark (as set with \fBset\-mark\-command\fP in Emacs mode, or by \fBvisual\-mode\fP
in Vi mode) is enabled
by default; consult this reference for more information\&.  Irascible
conservatives will wish to know that all highlighting may be disabled by
the following setting:

.PP
In many places, references are made to the \fBnumeric argument\fP\&.  This can
by default be entered in emacs mode by holding the alt key and typing
a number, or pressing escape before each digit, and in vi command mode
by typing the number before entering a command\&.  Generally the numeric
argument causes the next command entered to be repeated the specified
number of times, unless otherwise noted below; this is implemented
by the \fBdigit\-argument\fP widget\&. See also
the \fIArguments\fP subsection of the \fIWidgets\fP section for some other ways the numeric argument can be modified\&.

.SH "KEYMAPS"
A keymap in ZLE contains a set of bindings between key sequences
and ZLE commands\&.  The empty key sequence cannot be bound\&.
.PP
There can be any number of keymaps at any time, and each keymap has one
or more names\&.  If all of a keymap\&'s names are deleted, it disappears\&.
\fBbindkey\fP can be used to manipulate keymap names\&.
.PP
Initially, there are eight keymaps:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
\fBemacs\fP
EMACS emulation
.TP
\fBviins\fP
vi emulation \- insert mode
.TP
\fBvicmd\fP
vi emulation \- command mode
.TP
\fBviopp\fP
vi emulation \- operator pending
.TP
\fBvisual\fP
vi emulation \- selection active
.TP
\fBisearch\fP
incremental search mode
.TP
\fBcommand\fP
read a command name
.TP
\fB\&.safe\fP
fallback keymap
.PD
.PP
The `\fB\&.safe\fP\&' keymap is special\&.  It can never be altered, and the name
can never be removed\&.  However, it can be linked to other names, which can
be removed\&.  In the future other special keymaps may be added; users should
avoid using names beginning with `\fB\&.\fP\&' for their own keymaps\&.
.PP
In addition to these names, either `\fBemacs\fP\&' or `\fBviins\fP' is
also linked to the name `\fBmain\fP\&'\&.  If one of the \fBVISUAL\fP or
\fBEDITOR\fP environment variables contain the string `\fBvi\fP\&' when the shell
starts up then it will be `\fBviins\fP\&', otherwise it will be `\fBemacs\fP'\&.
\fBbindkey\fP\&'s \fB\-e\fP and \fB\-v\fP
options provide a convenient way to override this default choice\&.
.PP
When the editor starts up, it will select the `\fBmain\fP\&' keymap\&.
If that keymap doesn\&'t exist, it will use `\fB\&.safe\fP' instead\&.
.PP
In the `\fB\&.safe\fP\&' keymap, each single key is bound to \fBself\-insert\fP,
except for ^J (line feed) and ^M (return) which are bound to \fBaccept\-line\fP\&.
This is deliberately not pleasant to use; if you are using it, it
means you deleted the main keymap, and you should put it back\&.
.SS "Reading Commands"
When ZLE is reading a command from the terminal, it may read a sequence
that is bound to some command and is also a prefix of a longer bound string\&.
In this case ZLE will wait a certain time to see if more characters
are typed, and if not (or they don\&'t match any longer string) it will
execute the binding\&.  This timeout is defined by the \fBKEYTIMEOUT\fP parameter;
its default is 0\&.4 sec\&.  There is no timeout if the prefix string is not
itself bound to a command\&.
.PP
The key timeout is also applied when ZLE is reading the bytes from a
multibyte character string when it is in the appropriate mode\&.  (This
requires that the shell was compiled with multibyte mode enabled; typically
also the locale has characters with the UTF\-8 encoding, although any
multibyte encoding known to the operating system is supported\&.)  If the
second or a subsequent byte is not read within the timeout period, the
shell acts as if \fB?\fP were typed and resets the input state\&.
.PP
As well as ZLE commands, key sequences can be bound to other strings, by using
`\fBbindkey \-s\fP\&'\&.
When such a sequence is read, the replacement string is pushed back as input,
and the command reading process starts again using these fake keystrokes\&.
This input can itself invoke further replacement strings, but in order to
detect loops the process will be stopped if there are twenty such replacements
without a real command being read\&.
.PP
A key sequence typed by the user can be turned into a command name for use
in user\-defined widgets with the \fBread\-command\fP widget, described in
the subsection `Miscellaneous\&' of the section `Standard Widgets' below\&.
.SS "Local Keymaps"
While for normal editing a single keymap is used exclusively, in many
modes a local keymap allows for some keys to be customised\&. For example,
in an incremental search mode, a binding in the \fBisearch\fP keymap will
override a binding in the \fBmain\fP keymap but all keys that are not
overridden can still be used\&.
.PP
If a key sequence is defined in a local keymap, it will hide a key
sequence in the global keymap that is a prefix of that sequence\&. An
example of this occurs with the binding of \fBiw\fP in \fBviopp\fP as this
hides the binding of \fBi\fP in \fBvicmd\fP\&. However, a longer sequence in
the global keymap that shares the same prefix can still apply so for
example the binding of \fB^Xa\fP in the global keymap will be unaffected
by the binding of \fB^Xb\fP in the local keymap\&.
.PP
.SH "ZLE BUILTINS"
The ZLE module contains three related builtin commands\&. The \fBbindkey\fP
command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the \fBvared\fP command invokes
ZLE on the value of a shell parameter; and the \fBzle\fP command manipulates
editing widgets and allows command line access to ZLE commands from within
shell functions\&.

\fBbindkey\fP\&'s options can be divided into three categories: keymap
selection for the current command, operation selection, and others\&.  The
keymap selection options are:
.RS
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-e\fP
Selects keymap `\fBemacs\fP\&' for any operations by the current command,
and also links `\fBemacs\fP\&' to `\fBmain\fP' so that it is selected by
default the next time the editor starts\&.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
Selects keymap `\fBviins\fP\&' for any operations by the current command,
and also links `\fBviins\fP\&' to `\fBmain\fP' so that it is selected by default
the next time the editor starts\&.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP
Selects keymap `\fBvicmd\fP\&' for any operations by the current command\&.
.TP
\fB\-M\fP \fIkeymap\fP
The \fIkeymap\fP specifies a keymap name that is selected for any
operations by the current command\&.
.PP
If a keymap selection is required and none of the options above are used, the
`\fBmain\fP\&' keymap is used\&.  Some operations do not permit a keymap to be
selected, namely:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-l\fP
List all existing keymap names; if any arguments are given, list just
those keymaps\&.
.RS
.PP
If the \fB\-L\fP option is also used, list in the form of \fBbindkey\fP
commands to create or link the keymaps\&.  `\fBbindkey \-lL
main\fP\&' shows which keymap is linked to `\fBmain\fP', if any, and hence if
the standard emacs or vi emulation is in effect\&.  This option does
not show the \fB\&.safe\fP keymap because it cannot be created in that
fashion; however, neither is `\fBbindkey \-lL \&.safe\fP\&' reported as an
error, it simply outputs nothing\&.
.RE

.TP
\fB\-D\fP \fIkeymap\fP \&.\&.\&.

.TP
\fB\-A\fP \fIold\-keymap new\-keymap\fP
Make the \fInew\-keymap\fP name an alias for \fIold\-keymap\fP, so that
both names refer to the same keymap\&.  The names have equal standing;
if either is deleted, the other remains\&.  If there is already a keymap
with the \fInew\-keymap\fP name, it is deleted\&.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP \fInew\-keymap\fP [ \fIold\-keymap\fP ]
Create a new keymap, named \fInew\-keymap\fP\&.  If a keymap already has that
name, it is deleted\&.  If an \fIold\-keymap\fP name is given, the new keymap
is initialized to be a duplicate of it, otherwise the new keymap will
be empty\&.
.PP
To use a newly created keymap, it should be linked to \fBmain\fP\&.  Hence
the sequence of commands to create and use a new keymap `\fBmymap\fP\&'
initialized from the \fBemacs\fP keymap (which remains unchanged) is:
.PP

\fInewmap\fP is \fBemacs\fP or \fBviins\fP, it will not work for \fBvicmd\fP, as
switching from vi insert to command mode becomes impossible\&.

Only available if your system supports one of the `poll\&' or `select' system
calls; most modern systems do\&.
.RS
.PP
Installs \fIhandler\fP (the name of a shell function) to handle input from
file descriptor \fIfd\fP\&.  Installing a handler for an \fIfd\fP which is
already handled causes the existing handler to be replaced\&.  Any number of
handlers for any number of readable file descriptors may be installed\&.
Note that zle makes no attempt to check whether this \fIfd\fP is actually
readable when installing the handler\&.  The user must make their own
arrangements for handling the file descriptor when zle is not active\&.
.PP
When zle is attempting to read data, it will examine both the terminal and
the list of handled \fIfd\fP\&'s\&.  If data becomes available on a handled
\fIfd\fP, zle calls \fIhandler\fP with the fd which is ready for reading
as the first argument\&.  Under normal circumstances this is the only
argument, but if an error was detected, a second argument provides
details: `\fBhup\fP\&' for a disconnect, `\fBnval\fP' for a closed or otherwise
invalid descriptor, or `\fBerr\fP\&' for any other condition\&.  Systems that
support only the `select\&' system call always use `\fBerr\fP'\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-w\fP is also given, the \fIhandler\fP is instead a line
editor widget, typically a shell function made into a widget using
`\fBzle \-N\fP\&'\&.  In that case \fIhandler\fP can use all the facilities of zle
to update the current editing line\&.  Note, however, that as handling \fIfd\fP
takes place at a low level changes to the display will not automatically
appear; the widget should call `\fBzle \-R\fP\&' to force redisplay\&.  As of this
writing, widget handlers only support a single argument and thus are never
passed a string for error state, so widgets must be prepared to test the
descriptor themselves\&.
.PP
If either type of handler produces output to the terminal, it should call
`\fBzle \-I\fP\&' before doing so (see below)\&.  Handlers should not attempt to
read from the terminal\&.
.PP
If no \fIhandler\fP is given, but an \fIfd\fP is present, any handler for
that \fIfd\fP is removed\&.  If there is none, an error message is printed
and status 1 is returned\&.
.PP
If no arguments are given, or the \fB\-L\fP option is supplied, a list of
handlers is printed in a form which can be stored for later execution\&.
.PP
An \fIfd\fP (but not a \fIhandler\fP) may optionally be given with the \fB\-L\fP
option; in this case, the function will list the handler if any, else
silently return status 1\&.
.PP
Note that this feature should be used with care\&.  Activity on one of the
\fIfd\fP\&'s which is not properly handled can cause the terminal to become
unusable\&.  Removing an \fIfd\fP handler from within a signal trap may cause
unpredictable behavior\&.
.PP
Here is a simple example of using this feature\&.  A connection to a remote
TCP port is created using the ztcp command; see 
the description of the \fBzsh/net/tcp\fP module in \fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  Then a handler is installed
which simply prints out any data which arrives on this connection\&.  Note
that `select\&' will indicate that the file descriptor needs handling
if the remote side has closed the connection; we handle that by testing
for a failed read\&.

Unusually, this option is most useful outside ordinary widget functions,
though it may be used within if normal output to the terminal is required\&.
It invalidates the current zle display in preparation for output; typically
this will be from a trap function\&.  It has no effect if zle is not
active\&.  When a trap exits, the shell checks to see if the display needs
restoring, hence the following will print output in such a way as not to
disturb the line being edited:
.RS

.nf
\fBTRAPUSR1() {
  # Invalidate zle display
  [[ \-o zle ]] && zle \-I
  # Show output
  print Hello
}\fP
.fi

.PP
In general, the trap function may need to test whether zle is active before
using this method (as shown in the example), since the \fBzsh/zle\fP module
may not even be loaded; if it is not, the command can be skipped\&.
.PP
It is possible to call `\fBzle \-I\fP\&' several times before control is
returned to the editor; the display will only be invalidated the first time
to minimise disruption\&.
.PP
Note that there are normally better ways of manipulating the display from
within zle widgets; see, for example, `\fBzle \-R\fP\&' above\&.
.PP
The returned status is zero if zle was invalidated, even though
this may have been by a previous call to `\fBzle \-I\fP\&' or by a system
notification\&.  To test if a zle widget may be called at this point, execute
\fBzle\fP with no arguments and examine the return status\&.

output as its first argument; if the operation required a numeric
argument, that is passed as a second argument\&.  The function should set
the shell variable \fBREPLY\fP to the transformed termcap code\&.  Typically
this is used to produce some simply formatted version of the code and
optional argument for debugging or testing\&.  Note that this

Any further arguments will be passed to the widget; note that as
standard argument handling is performed, any general argument list
should be preceded by \fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&.  If it is a shell
function, these are passed down as positional parameters; for builtin
widgets it is up to the widget in question what it does with them\&.
Currently arguments are only handled by the incremental\-search commands,
the \fBhistory\-search\-forward\fP and \fB\-backward\fP and the corresponding

The return status reflects the success or failure of the operation carried

A non\-zero return status causes the shell to beep when the widget exits,

.PP
The standard widgets built into ZLE are listed in Standard Widgets below\&.
Other built\-in widgets can be defined by other modules (see

same name preceded by a `\fB\&.\fP\&'\&.  The `\fB\&.\fP' name is special: it can't be
rebound to a different widget\&.  This makes the widget available even when
its usual name has been redefined\&.

User\-defined widgets are defined using `\fBzle \-N\fP\&', and implemented
as shell functions\&.  When the widget is executed, the corresponding
shell function is executed, and can perform editing (or other) actions\&.
It is recommended that user\-defined widgets should not have names

.SH "USER\-DEFINED WIDGETS"
User\-defined widgets, being implemented as shell functions,
can execute any normal shell command\&.  They can also run other widgets
(whether built\-in or user\-defined) using the \fBzle\fP builtin command\&. The
standard input of the function is redirected from /dev/null to prevent
external commands from unintentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the
terminal, but \fBread \-k\fP or \fBread \-q\fP can be used to read characters\&.
Finally, they can examine and edit the ZLE buffer being edited by reading
and setting the special parameters described below\&.
.PP
These special parameters are always available in widget functions, but
are not in any way special outside ZLE\&.  If they have some normal value
outside ZLE, that value is temporarily inaccessible, but will return
when the widget function exits\&.  These special parameters in fact have
local scope, like parameters created in a function using \fBlocal\fP\&.

Inside completion widgets and traps called while ZLE is active, these
parameters are available read\-only\&.

Note that cursor keys are bound to movement keys in all three keymaps;
the shell assumes that the cursor keys send the key sequences reported
by the terminal\-handling library (termcap or terminfo)\&.  The key sequences
shown in the list are those based on the VT100, common on many modern
terminals, but in fact these are not necessarily bound\&.  In the case of the
\fBviins\fP keymap, the initial escape character of the sequences serves also
to return to the \fBvicmd\fP keymap: whether this happens is determined by
the \fBKEYTIMEOUT\fP parameter, see \fIzshparam\fP(1)\&.

reexamined\&.  Note that negative numbers should be preceded by a

If two arguments are given, the second specifies the word on the command

Toggle vim\-style visual selection mode\&. If line\-wise visual mode is
currently enabled then it is changed to being character\-wise\&. If used
following an operator, it forces the subsequent movement command to be
treated as a character\-wise movement\&.
.TP
\fBvisual\-line\-mode\fP (unbound) (\fBV\fP) (unbound)
Toggle vim\-style line\-wise visual selection mode\&. If character\-wise
visual mode is currently enabled then it is changed to being line\-wise\&. If used
following an operator, it forces the subsequent movement command to be
treated as a line\-wise movement\&.
.TP
\fBwhat\-cursor\-position\fP (\fB^X=\fP) (\fBga\fP) (unbound)
Print the character under the cursor, its code as an octal, decimal and
hexadecimal number, the current cursor position within the buffer and the
column of the cursor in the current line\&.
.TP
\fBwhere\-is\fP
Read the name of an editor command and print the listing of key
sequences that invoke the specified command\&.
A restricted set of editing functions is available in the
mini\-buffer\&.  Keys are looked up in the special
\fBcommand\fP keymap, and if not found there in the main keymap\&.
.TP
\fBwhich\-command\fP (\fBESC\-?\fP) (unbound) (unbound)
Push the buffer onto the buffer stack, and execute the
command `\fBwhich\-command\fP \fIcmd\fP\&'\&. where \fIcmd\fP is the current
command\&.  \fBwhich\-command\fP is normally aliased to \fBwhence\fP\&.
.TP
\fBvi\-digit\-or\-beginning\-of\-line\fP (unbound) (\fB0\fP) (unbound)
If the last command executed was a digit as part of an argument,
continue the argument\&.  Otherwise, execute vi\-beginning\-of\-line\&.
.SS "Text Objects"
Text objects are commands that can be used to select a block of text
according to some criteria\&. They are a feature of the vim text editor
and so are primarily intended for use with vi operators or from visual
selection mode\&. However, they can also be used from vi\-insert or emacs
mode\&. Key bindings listed below apply to the \fBviopp\fP and \fBvisual\fP
keymaps\&.

\fBselect\-a\-blank\-word\fP (\fBaW\fP)
Select a word including adjacent blanks, where a word is defined as a
series of non\-blank characters\&. With a numeric argument, multiple words
will be selected\&.
.TP
\fBselect\-a\-shell\-word\fP (\fBaa\fP)
Select the current command argument applying the normal rules for
quoting\&.
.TP
\fBselect\-a\-word\fP (\fBaw\fP)
Select a word including adjacent blanks, using the normal vi\-style word
definition\&. With a numeric argument, multiple words will be selected\&.

\fBselect\-in\-shell\-word\fP (\fBia\fP)
Select the current command argument applying the normal rules for
quoting\&. If the argument begins and ends with matching quote characters,
these are not included in the selection\&.

\fBselect\-in\-word\fP (\fBiw\fP)
Select a word, using the normal vi\-style word definition\&. With a numeric
argument, multiple words will be selected\&.

.SH "CHARACTER HIGHLIGHTING"
.PP
The line editor has the ability to highlight characters or regions
of the line that have a particular significance\&.  This is controlled
by the array parameter \fBzle_highlight\fP, if it has been set by the user\&.
.PP
If the parameter contains the single entry \fBnone\fP all highlighting
is turned off\&.  Note the parameter is still expected to be an array\&.
.PP
Otherwise each entry of the array should consist of a word indicating a
context for highlighting, then a colon, then a comma\-separated list of
the types of highlighting to apply in that context\&.
.PP
The contexts available for highlighting are the following:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBdefault\fP
Any text within the command line not affected by any other highlighting\&.
Text outside the editable area of the command line is not affected\&.
.TP
\fBisearch\fP
When one of the incremental history search widgets is active, the
area of the command line matched by the search string or pattern\&.
.TP
\fBregion\fP
The currently selected text\&. In emacs terminology, this is referred to as
the region and is bounded by the cursor (point) and the mark\&. The region
is only highlighted if it is active, which is the case after the mark
is modified with \fBset\-mark\-command\fP or \fBexchange\-point\-and\-mark\fP\&.
Note that whether or not the region is active has no effect on its
use within emacs style widgets, it simply determines whether it is
highlighted\&. In vi mode, the region corresponds to selected text in
visual mode\&.
.TP
\fBspecial\fP
Individual characters that have no direct printable
representation but are shown in a special manner by the line editor\&.
These characters are described below\&.
.TP
\fBsuffix\fP
This context is used in completion for characters that are
marked as suffixes that will be removed if the completion ends
at that point, the most obvious example being a slash (\fB/\fP) after
a directory name\&.  Note that suffix removal is configurable; the
circumstances under which the suffix will be removed may differ
for different completions\&.
.TP
\fBpaste\fP
Following a command to paste text, the characters that were inserted\&.
.PP
When \fBregion_highlight\fP is set, the contexts that describe a region \-\-
\fBisearch\fP, \fBregion\fP, \fBsuffix\fP, and \fBpaste\fP \-\-
are applied first, then \fBregion_highlight\fP is applied, then the remaining
\fBzle_highlight\fP contexts are applied\&.  If a particular character is
affected by multiple specifications, the last specification wins\&.
.PP
\fBzle_highlight\fP may contain additional fields for controlling how
terminal sequences to change colours are output\&.  Each of the following is
followed by a colon and a string in the same form as for key bindings\&.
This will not be necessary for the vast majority of terminals as the
defaults shown in parentheses are widely used\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBfg_start_code\fP (\fB\ee[3\fP)
The start of the escape sequence for the foreground colour\&.
This is followed by one to three ASCII digits representing the colour\&.
Only used for palette colors, i\&.e\&. not 24\-bit colors specified via a
color triplet\&.
.TP
\fBfg_default_code\fP (\fB9\fP)
The number to use instead of the colour to reset the default foreground
colour\&.
.TP
\fBfg_end_code\fP (\fBm\fP)
The end of the escape sequence for the foreground colour\&.
.TP
\fBbg_start_code\fP (\fB\ee[4\fP)
The start of the escape sequence for the background colour\&.
See \fBfg_start_code\fP above\&.
.TP
\fBbg_default_code\fP (\fB9\fP)
The number to use instead of the colour to reset the default
background colour\&.
.TP
\fBbg_end_code\fP (\fBm\fP)
The end of the escape sequence for the background colour\&.
.PP
The available types of highlighting are the following\&.  Note that
not all types of highlighting are available on all terminals:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBnone\fP
No highlighting is applied to the given context\&.  It is not useful for
this to appear with other types of highlighting; it is used to override
a default\&.
.TP
\fBfg=\fP\fIcolour\fP
The foreground colour should be set to \fIcolour\fP, a decimal integer,
the name of one of the eight most widely\-supported colours or as a
`\fB#\fP\&' followed by an RGB triplet in hexadecimal format\&.
.RS
.PP
Not all terminals support this and, of those that do, not all provide
facilities to test the support, hence the user should decide based on the
terminal type\&.  Most terminals support the colours \fBblack\fP, \fBred\fP,
\fBgreen\fP, \fByellow\fP, \fBblue\fP, \fBmagenta\fP, \fBcyan\fP and \fBwhite\fP,
which can be set by name\&.  In addition\&. \fBdefault\fP may be used to
set the terminal\&'s default foreground colour\&.  Abbreviations are allowed;
\fBb\fP or \fBbl\fP selects black\&.  Some terminals may generate additional
colours if the \fBbold\fP attribute is also present\&.
.PP
On recent terminals and on systems with an up\-to\-date terminal database the
number of colours supported may be tested by the command `\fBechotc
Co\fP\&'; if this succeeds, it indicates a limit on the number of colours which
will be enforced by the line editor\&.  The number of colours is in any case
limited to 256 (i\&.e\&. the range 0 to 255)\&.
.PP
Some modern terminal emulators have support for 24\-bit true colour (16
million colours)\&. In this case, the hex triplet format can be used\&. This
consists of a `\fB#\fP\&' followed by either a three or six digit hexadecimal
number describing the red, green and blue components of the colour\&. Hex
triplets can also be used with 88 and 256 colour terminals via the
\fBzsh/nearcolor\fP module (see \fIzshmodules\fP(1))\&.
.PP
Colour is also known as color\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBbg=\fP\fIcolour\fP
The background colour should be set to \fIcolour\fP\&.
This works similarly to the foreground colour, except the background is
not usually affected by the bold attribute\&.
.TP
\fBbold\fP
The characters in the given context are shown in a bold font\&.
Not all terminals distinguish bold fonts\&.
.TP
\fBstandout\fP
The characters in the given context are shown in the terminal\&'s standout
mode\&.  The actual effect is specific to the terminal; on many terminals it
is inverse video\&.  On some such terminals, where the cursor does not blink
it appears with standout mode negated, making it less than clear where
the cursor actually is\&.  On such terminals one of the other effects
may be preferable for highlighting the region and matched search string\&.
.TP
\fBunderline\fP
The characters in the given context are shown underlined\&.  Some
terminals show the foreground in a different colour instead; in this
case whitespace will not be highlighted\&.
.PP
The characters described above as `special\&' are as follows\&.  The
formatting described here is used irrespective of whether the characters
are highlighted:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
ASCII control characters
Control characters in the ASCII range are shown as
`\fB^\fP\&' followed by the base character\&.
.TP
Unprintable multibyte characters
This item applies to control characters not in the ASCII range,
plus other characters as follows\&.  If the \fBMULTIBYTE\fP option is in
effect, multibyte characters not in the ASCII character set that are
reported as having zero width are treated as combining characters when the
option \fBCOMBINING_CHARS\fP is on\&.  If the option is off, or if a character
appears where a combining character is not valid, the character
is treated as unprintable\&.
.RS
.PP
Unprintable multibyte characters are shown as a hexadecimal number between
angle brackets\&.  The number is the code point of the character in the wide
character set; this may or may not be Unicode, depending on the operating
system\&.
.RE
.TP
Invalid multibyte characters
If the \fBMULTIBYTE\fP option is in effect, any sequence of one or more
bytes that does not form a valid character in the current character
set is treated as a series of bytes each shown as a special character\&.
This case can be distinguished from other unprintable characters
as the bytes are represented as two hexadecimal digits between angle
brackets, as distinct from the four or eight digits that are used for
unprintable characters that are nonetheless valid in the current
character set\&.
.RS
.PP
Not all systems support this: for it to work, the system\&'s representation of
wide characters must be code values from the Universal Character Set,
as defined by IS0 10646 (also known as Unicode)\&.
.RE
.TP
Wrapped double\-width characters
When a double\-width character appears in the final column of a line, it
is instead shown on the next line\&. The empty space left in the original
position is highlighted as a special character\&.

.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Op Fl w

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm vmmap
displays the virtual memory regions allocated in a specified process,
helping a programmer understand how memory is being used, and what the
purposes of memory at a given address may be.
.Pp
.Nm vmmap
requires one argument -- either the process ID or the full or partial executable name
of the process to examine, or the pathname of a memory graph file generated by
.Nm leaks
or the Xcode Memory Graph Debugger.
.Pp
If the optional
.Ar address
is given, information is only shown for the VM region containing that
address (if any) and the regions around it.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-allSplitLibs"
.It Fl w, Fl wide
Print wide output, to show full paths of mapped files.
.It Fl v, Fl verbose
Equivalent to
.Fl w
.Fl submap
.Fl allSplitLibs
.Fl noCoalesce
.It Fl pages
Print region sizes in page counts rather than kilobytes.
.It Fl interleaved
Print all regions in ascending order of starting address, rather than
printing all non-writable regions followed by all writable regions.
.It Fl submap
Print information about VM submaps.
.It Fl allSplitLibs
Print information about all shared system split libraries, even those not
loaded by this process.
.It Fl noCoalesce
Do not coalesce adjacent identical regions.  Default is to coalesce for more concise output.
.It Fl summary
Print only the summary of VM usage, not the individual region detail.

.Sh EXPLANATION OF OUTPUT
For each region,
.Nm vmmap
describes the starting address, ending address, size of the region (in kilobytes or pages),
read/write permissions for the page, sharing mode for the page, and the
purpose of the pages.
.Pp
The size of the virtual memory region represents the virtual memory pages
reserved, but not necessarily allocated.  For example, using the vm_allocate
Mach system call reserves the pages, but physical memory won't be allocated
for the page until the memory is actually touched.  A memory-mapped file may
have a virtual memory page reserved, but the pages are not instantiated until
a read or write happens.
Thus, this size may not correctly describe the application's true memory
usage.
.Pp
By default, the sizes are shown in kilobytes or megabytes.  If the
.Fl pages
flag is given, then the sizes are in number of VM pages.
.Pp
The protection mode describes if the memory is readable, writable, or
executable.  Each virtual memory region has a current permission, and
a maximum permission.  In the line for a virtual memory region, the
current permission is displayed first, the maximum permission second.
For example, the first page of an application (starting at address
0x00000000) permits neither reads, writes, or execution ("---"),
ensuring that any reads or writes to address 0, or dereferences of a
NULL pointer immediately cause a bus error.  Pages representing an
executable always have the execute and read bits set ("r-x").  The
current permissions usually do not permit writing to the region.
However, the maximum permissions allow writing so that the debugger
can request write access to a page to insert breakpoints.
Permissions for executables appear as "r-x/rwx" to indicate these
permissions.
.Pp
The share mode describes whether pages are shared between processes,and
what happens when pages are modified.  Private pages (PRV) are pages only
visible to this process.  They are allocated as they are written to, and can
be paged out to disk. Copy-on-write (COW) pages are shared by multiple processes
(or shared by a single process in multiple locations).  When the page
is modified, the writing process then receives its own private copy of the page.
Empty (NUL) sharing implies that the page does not really exist in physical
memory.  Aliased (ALI) and shared (SHM) memory is shared between processes.
.Pp
The share mode typically describes the general mode controlling the region.
For example, as copy-on-write pages are modified, they become private to the
application.  Even with the private pages, the region is still COW until all
pages become private.  Once all pages are private, then the share mode would
change to private.  
.Pp
The far left column names the purpose of the memory: 
malloc regions, stack, text or data segment, etc.  For regions
loaded from binaries, the far right shows the library loaded into the
memory.
.Pp
If the
.Fl submaps
flag is given, then vmmap's output includes descriptions of submaps.
A submap is a shared set of virtual memory page descriptions that the
operating system can reuse between multiple processes.  Submaps
minimize the operating system's memory usage by representing the virtual memory
regions only once.  Submaps can either be shared by all processes 
(machine-wide) or local to the process (process-only).  (Understanding
where submaps are located is irrelevant for most developers, but may be
interesting for anyone working with low levels of the virtual memory system.)
.Pp
For example, one submap contains the read-only portions of the most common dynamic libraries.
These libraries are needed by most programs on the system, and because they are read-only,
they will never be changed.
As a result, the operating system shares these pages between all the processes,
and only needs to create a single data structure to describe how this memory
is laid out in every process.
.Pp
That section of memory is referred to as the "split library region", and
it is shared system-wide.  So, technically, all of the dynamic libraries that
have been loaded into that region are in the VM map of every process, even though
some processes may not be using some of those libraries.  By default, vmmap shows
only those shared system split libraries that have been loaded into the specified
target process.  If the
.Fl allSplitLibs
flag is given, information about all
shared system split libraries will be printed, regardless of whether they've been
loaded into the specified target process or not.
.Pp
If the contents of
a machine-wide submap are changed -- for example, the debugger makes a section
of memory for a dylib writable so it can insert debugging traps -- then
the submap becomes local, and the kernel will allocate memory to store the
extra copy.
.Pp
% FRAG, fragmentation, in the MALLOC ZONE summary is computed by the following method:
.Pp
    % FRAG = 100 - (100 * Allocated / (Dirty + Swapped))
.Pp
Dirty and swapped are memory which has been written to by the process.  Allocated is the number
of bytes currently allocated from malloc.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr heap 1 ,
.Xr leaks 1 ,
.Xr malloc_history 1 ,
.Xr stringdups 1 ,
.Xr lsof 8
.Pp
The heap, leaks, and malloc_history commands can be used to look at various
aspects of a process's memory usage.
.Pp
The lsof command can be used to get a list of open and mapped files in one
or more processes, which can help determine why a volume can't be unmounted
or ejected, for example.
.Pp
The Xcode developer tools also include Instruments, a graphical application that can give information similar to that provided by
.Nm vmmap.
The Allocations instrument graphically displays dynamic, real-time
information about the object and memory use in an application (including VM allocations), as well as backtraces
of where the allocations occured.  The VM Tracker instrument in the Allocations template graphically displays
information about the virtual memory regions in a process.

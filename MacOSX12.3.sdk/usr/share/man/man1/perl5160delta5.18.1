.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.14.0 release and
the 5.16.0 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and
5.14.0.
.PP
Some bug fixes in this release have been backported to later
releases of 5.14.x.  Those are indicated with the 5.14.x version in
parentheses.
.SH "Notice"
.IX Header "Notice"
With the release of Perl 5.16.0, the 5.12.x series of releases is now out of
its support period.  There may be future 5.12.x releases, but only in the
event of a critical security issue.  Users of Perl 5.12 or earlier should
consider upgrading to a more recent release of Perl.

.IX Subsection "use VERSION"
As of this release, version declarations like \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR now disable
all features before enabling the new feature bundle.  This means that
the following holds true:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    use 5.016;
\&    # only 5.16 features enabled here
\&    use 5.014;
\&    # only 5.14 features enabled here (not 5.16)
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`use v5.12\*(C'\fR and higher continue to enable strict, but explicit \f(CW\*(C`use
strict\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`no strict\*(C'\fR now override the version declaration, even
when they come first:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    no strict;
\&    use 5.012;
\&    # no strict here
.Ve
.PP
There is a new \*(L":default\*(R" feature bundle that represents the set of
features enabled before any version declaration or \f(CW\*(C`use feature\*(C'\fR has
been seen.  Version declarations below 5.10 now enable the \*(L":default\*(R"
feature set.  This does not actually change the behavior of \f(CW\*(C`use
v5.8\*(C'\fR, because features added to the \*(L":default\*(R" set are those that were
traditionally enabled by default, before they could be turned off.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`no feature\*(C'\fR now resets to the default feature set.  To disable all
features (which is likely to be a pretty special-purpose request, since
it presumably won't match any named set of semantics) you can now  
write \f(CW\*(C`no feature \*(Aq:all\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW$[\fR is now disabled under \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR.  It is part of the default
feature set and can be turned on or off explicitly with \f(CW\*(C`use feature
\&\*(Aqarray_base\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.

(see feature) or \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR, returns a reference to the current
subroutine, making it easier to write recursive closures.
.SS "New and Improved Built-ins"
.IX Subsection "New and Improved Built-ins"
\fIMore consistent \f(CI\*(C`eval\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "More consistent eval"
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR operator sometimes treats a string argument as a sequence of
characters and sometimes as a sequence of bytes, depending on the
internal encoding.  The internal encoding is not supposed to make any
difference, but there is code that relies on this inconsistency.
.PP
The new \f(CW\*(C`unicode_eval\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`evalbytes\*(C'\fR features (enabled under \f(CW\*(C`use
5.16.0\*(C'\fR) resolve this.  The \f(CW\*(C`unicode_eval\*(C'\fR feature causes \f(CW\*(C`eval
$string\*(C'\fR to treat the string always as Unicode.  The \f(CW\*(C`evalbytes\*(C'\fR
features provides a function, itself called \f(CW\*(C`evalbytes\*(C'\fR, which
evaluates its argument always as a string of bytes.
.PP
These features also fix oddities with source filters leaking to outer
dynamic scopes.
.PP
See feature for more detail.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`substr\*(C'\fI lvalue revamp\fR
.IX Subsection "substr lvalue revamp"
.PP
When \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR is called in lvalue or potential lvalue context with two
or three arguments, a special lvalue scalar is returned that modifies
the original string (the first argument) when assigned to.
.PP
Previously, the offsets (the second and third arguments) passed to
\&\f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR would be converted immediately to match the string, negative
offsets being translated to positive and offsets beyond the end of the
string being truncated.
.PP
Now, the offsets are recorded without modification in the special
lvalue scalar that is returned, and the original string is not even
looked at by \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR itself, but only when the returned lvalue is
read or modified.
.PP
These changes result in an incompatible change:
.PP
If the original string changes length after the call to \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR but
before assignment to its return value, negative offsets will remember
their position from the end of the string, affecting code like this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    my $string = "string";
\&    my $lvalue = \esubstr $string, \-4, 2;
\&    print $$lvalue, "\en"; # prints "ri"
\&    $string = "bailing twine";
\&    print $$lvalue, "\en"; # prints "wi"; used to print "il"
.Ve
.PP
The same thing happens with an omitted third argument.  The returned
lvalue will always extend to the end of the string, even if the string
becomes longer.
.PP
Since this change also allowed many bugs to be fixed (see
"The \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR operator"), and since the behavior
of negative offsets has never been specified, the
change was deemed acceptable.
.PP
\fIReturn value of \f(CI\*(C`tied\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Return value of tied"
.PP
The value returned by \f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR on a tied variable is now the actual
scalar that holds the object to which the variable is tied.  This
lets ties be weakened with \f(CW\*(C`Scalar::Util::weaken(tied
$tied_variable)\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Unicode Support"
.IX Subsection "Unicode Support"
\fISupports (\fIalmost\fI) Unicode 6.1\fR
.IX Subsection "Supports (almost) Unicode 6.1"
.PP
Besides the addition of whole new scripts, and new characters in
existing scripts, this new version of Unicode, as always, makes some
changes to existing characters.  One change that may trip up some
applications is that the General Category of two characters in the
Latin\-1 range, \s-1PILCROW SIGN\s0 and \s-1SECTION SIGN,\s0 has been changed from
Other_Symbol to Other_Punctuation.  The same change has been made for
a character in each of Tibetan, Ethiopic, and Aegean.
The code points U+3248..U+324F (\s-1CIRCLED NUMBER TEN ON BLACK SQUARE\s0
through \s-1CIRCLED NUMBER EIGHTY ON BLACK SQUARE\s0) have had their General
Category changed from Other_Symbol to Other_Numeric.  The Line Break
property has changes for Hebrew and Japanese; and because of
other changes in 6.1, the Perl regular expression construct \f(CW\*(C`\eX\*(C'\fR now
works differently for some characters in Thai and Lao.
.PP
New aliases (synonyms) have been defined for many property values;
these, along with the previously existing ones, are all cross-indexed in
perluniprops.
.PP
The return value of \f(CW\*(C`charnames::viacode()\*(C'\fR is affected by other
changes:
.PP
.Vb 10
\& Code point      Old Name             New Name
\&   U+000A    LINE FEED (LF)        LINE FEED
\&   U+000C    FORM FEED (FF)        FORM FEED
\&   U+000D    CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)  CARRIAGE RETURN
\&   U+0085    NEXT LINE (NEL)       NEXT LINE
\&   U+008E    SINGLE\-SHIFT 2        SINGLE\-SHIFT\-2
\&   U+008F    SINGLE\-SHIFT 3        SINGLE\-SHIFT\-3
\&   U+0091    PRIVATE USE 1         PRIVATE USE\-1
\&   U+0092    PRIVATE USE 2         PRIVATE USE\-2
\&   U+2118    SCRIPT CAPITAL P      WEIERSTRASS ELLIPTIC FUNCTION
.Ve
.PP
Perl will accept any of these names as input, but
\&\f(CW\*(C`charnames::viacode()\*(C'\fR now returns the new name of each pair.  The
change for U+2118 is considered by Unicode to be a correction, that is
the original name was a mistake (but again, it will remain forever valid
to use it to refer to U+2118).  But most of these changes are the
fallout of the mistake Unicode 6.0 made in naming a character used in
Japanese cell phones to be \*(L"\s-1BELL\*(R",\s0 which conflicts with the longstanding
industry use of (and Unicode's recommendation to use) that name
to mean the \s-1ASCII\s0 control character at U+0007.  Therefore, that name
has been deprecated in Perl since v5.14, and any use of it will raise a
warning message (unless turned off).  The name \*(L"\s-1ALERT\*(R"\s0 is now the
preferred name for this code point, with \*(L"\s-1BEL\*(R"\s0 an acceptable short
form.  The name for the new cell phone character, at code point U+1F514,
remains undefined in this version of Perl (hence we don't 
implement quite all of Unicode 6.1), but starting in v5.18, \s-1BELL\s0 will mean
this character, and not U+0007.
.PP
Unicode has taken steps to make sure that this sort of mistake does not
happen again.  The Standard now includes all generally accepted
names and abbreviations for control characters, whereas previously it
didn't (though there were recommended names for most of them, which Perl
used).  This means that most of those recommended names are now
officially in the Standard.  Unicode did not recommend names for the
four code points listed above between U+008E and U+008F, and in
standardizing them Unicode subtly changed the names that Perl had
previously given them, by replacing the final blank in each name by a
hyphen.  Unicode also officially accepts names that Perl had deprecated,
such as \s-1FILE SEPARATOR. \s0 Now the only deprecated name is \s-1BELL.\s0
Finally, Perl now uses the new official names instead of the old
(now considered obsolete) names for the first four code points in the
list above (the ones which have the parentheses in them).
.PP
Now that the names have been placed in the Unicode standard, these kinds
of changes should not happen again, though corrections, such as to
U+2118, are still possible.
.PP
Unicode also added some name abbreviations, which Perl now accepts:
\&\s-1SP\s0 for \s-1SPACE\s0;
\&\s-1TAB\s0 for \s-1CHARACTER TABULATION\s0;
\&\s-1NEW LINE, END OF LINE, NL,\s0 and \s-1EOL\s0 for \s-1LINE FEED\s0;
LOCKING-SHIFT \s-1ONE\s0 for \s-1SHIFT OUT\s0;
LOCKING-SHIFT \s-1ZERO\s0 for \s-1SHIFT IN\s0;
and \s-1ZWNBSP\s0 for \s-1ZERO WIDTH\s0 NO-BREAK \s-1SPACE.\s0
.PP
More details on this version of Unicode are provided in
<http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/>.

\fI\f(CI\*(C`use charnames\*(C'\fI is no longer needed for \f(CI\*(C`\eN{\f(CIname\f(CI}\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "use charnames is no longer needed for N{name}"
.PP
When \f(CW\*(C`\eN{\f(CIname\f(CW}\*(C'\fR is encountered, the \f(CW\*(C`charnames\*(C'\fR module is now
automatically loaded when needed as if the \f(CW\*(C`:full\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`:short\*(C'\fR
options had been specified.  See charnames for more information.
.PP

\&\*(L"Updated Modules and Pragmata\*(R" below.
.PP
\fIUnicode Symbol Names\fR
.IX Subsection "Unicode Symbol Names"
.PP
Perl now has proper support for Unicode in symbol names.  It used to be
that \f(CW\*(C`*{$foo}\*(C'\fR would ignore the internal \s-1UTF8\s0 flag and use the bytes of
the underlying representation to look up the symbol.  That meant that
\&\f(CW\*(C`*{"\ex{100}"}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`*{"\exc4\ex80"}\*(C'\fR would return the same thing.  All
these parts of Perl have been fixed to account for Unicode:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Method names (including those passed to \f(CW\*(C`use overload\*(C'\fR)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Typeglob names (including names of variables, subroutines, and filehandles)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Package names
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4

.IP "\(bu" 4
Subroutine prototypes
.IP "\(bu" 4
Attributes
.IP "\(bu" 4
Various warnings and error messages that mention variable names or values,
methods, etc.
.PP
In addition, a parsing bug has been fixed that prevented \f(CW\*(C`*{e\*'}\*(C'\fR from
implicitly quoting the name, but instead interpreted it as \f(CW\*(C`*{+e\*'}\*(C'\fR, which
would cause a strict violation.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`*{"*a::b"}\*(C'\fR automatically strips off the * if it is followed by an \s-1ASCII\s0
letter.  That has been extended to all Unicode identifier characters.
.PP
One-character non-ASCII non-punctuation variables (like \f(CW\*(C`$e\*'\*(C'\fR) are now
subject to \*(L"Used only once\*(R" warnings.  They used to be exempt, as they
were treated as punctuation variables.
.PP
Also, single-character Unicode punctuation variables (like \f(CW$X\fR) are now
supported [perl #69032].
.PP
\fIImproved ability to mix locales and Unicode, including \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales\fR
.IX Subsection "Improved ability to mix locales and Unicode, including UTF-8 locales"
.PP
An optional parameter has been added to \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR
.PP
.Vb 1
\& use locale \*(Aq:not_characters\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
which tells Perl to use all but the \f(CW\*(C`LC_CTYPE\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`LC_COLLATE\*(C'\fR
portions of the current locale.  Instead, the character set is assumed
to be Unicode.  This lets locales and Unicode be seamlessly mixed,
including the increasingly frequent \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales.  When using this
hybrid form of locales, the \f(CW\*(C`:locale\*(C'\fR layer to the open pragma can
be used to interface with the file system, and there are \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
available for \s-1ARGV\s0 and environment variable conversions.

.IX Subsection "New function fc and corresponding escape sequence F for Unicode foldcase"
.PP
Unicode foldcase is an extension to lowercase that gives better results
when comparing two strings case-insensitively.  It has long been used
internally in regular expression \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR matching.  Now it is available
explicitly through the new \f(CW\*(C`fc\*(C'\fR function call (enabled by
\&\f(CW"use\ feature\ \*(Aqfc\*(Aq"\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR, or explicitly callable via

Most other XS-callable functions that take \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded input

the latter meaning was valid only with the \*(L"switch\*(R" feature enabled, and

.IX Subsection "Tying scalars that hold typeglobs"
Attempting to tie a scalar after a typeglob was assigned to it would
instead tie the handle in the typeglob's \s-1IO\s0 slot.  This meant that it was
impossible to tie the scalar itself.  Similar problems affected \f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`untie\*(C'\fR: \f(CW\*(C`tied $scalar\*(C'\fR would return false on a tied scalar if the last

We fixed this problem before Perl 5.14.0, but it caused problems with some

Now the deprecation has been removed and this bug has been fixed.  So
\&\f(CW\*(C`tie $scalar\*(C'\fR will always tie the scalar, not the handle it holds.  To tie
the handle, use \f(CW\*(C`tie *$scalar\*(C'\fR (with an explicit asterisk).  The same

The fix for those breakages is to use \f(CW\*(C`PerlProc_gete?[ug]id()\*(C'\fR to

Improved performance for Unicode properties in regular expressions
.Sp
Matching a code point against a Unicode property is now done via a
binary search instead of linear.  This means for example that the worst
case for a 1000 item property is 10 probes instead of 1000.  This
inefficiency has been compensated for in the past by permanently storing
in a hash the results of a given probe plus the results for the adjacent
64 code points, under the theory that near-by code points are likely to
be searched for.  A separate hash was used for each mention of a Unicode
property in each regular expression.  Thus, \f(CW\*(C`qr/\ep{foo}abc\ep{foo}/\*(C'\fR
would generate two hashes.  Any probes in one instance would be unknown
to the other, and the hashes could expand separately to be quite large
if the regular expression were used on many different widely-separated
code points.
Now, however, there is just one hash shared by all instances of a given
property.  This means that if \f(CW\*(C`\ep{foo}\*(C'\fR is matched against \*(L"A\*(R" in one
regular expression in a thread, the result will be known immediately to
all regular expressions, and the relentless march of using up memory is
slowed considerably.

Version declarations with the \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR keyword (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`use 5.012\*(C'\fR) are now
faster, as they enable features without loading \fIfeature.pm\fR.

\&\f(CW\*(C`local $_\*(C'\fR is faster now, as it no longer iterates through magic that it

Perl 5.12.0 sped up the destruction of objects whose classes define
empty \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR methods (to prevent autoloading), by simply not
calling such empty methods.  This release takes this optimization a
step further, by not calling any \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR method that begins with a
\&\f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement.  This can be useful for destructors that are only
used for debugging:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use constant DEBUG => 1;
\&    sub DESTROY { return unless DEBUG; ... }
.Ve
.Sp
Constant-folding will reduce the first statement to \f(CW\*(C`return;\*(C'\fR if \s-1DEBUG\s0
is set to 0, triggering this optimization.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning to a variable that holds a typeglob or copy-on-write scalar
is now much faster.  Previously the typeglob would be stringified or
the copy-on-write scalar would be copied before being clobbered.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assignment to \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR in void context is now more than twice its
previous speed.  Instead of creating and returning a special lvalue
scalar that is then assigned to, \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR modifies the original string
itself.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR no longer calculates a value to return when called in void
context.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Due to changes in File::Glob, Perl's \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR function and its \f(CW\*(C`<...>\*(C'\fR equivalent are now much faster.  The splitting of the pattern
into words has been rewritten in C, resulting in speed-ups of 20% for
some cases.
.Sp
This does not affect \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR on \s-1VMS,\s0 as it does not use File::Glob.

Things that may break your code:
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`url()\*(C'\fR was fixed to return \f(CW\*(C`PATH_INFO\*(C'\fR when it is explicitly requested
with either the \f(CW\*(C`path=>1\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`path_info=>1\*(C'\fR flag.
.Sp
If your code is running under mod_rewrite (or compatible) and you are
calling \f(CW\*(C`self_url()\*(C'\fR or you are calling \f(CW\*(C`url()\*(C'\fR and passing
\&\f(CW\*(C`path_info=>1\*(C'\fR, these methods will actually be returning
\&\f(CW\*(C`PATH_INFO\*(C'\fR now, as you have explicitly requested or \f(CW\*(C`self_url()\*(C'\fR
has requested on your behalf.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`PATH_INFO\*(C'\fR has been omitted in such URLs since the issue was
introduced in the 3.12 release in December, 2005.
.Sp
This bug is so old your application may have come to depend on it or
workaround it. Check for application before upgrading to this release.
.Sp
Examples of affected method calls:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  $q\->url(\-absolute => 1, \-query => 1, \-path_info => 1);
\&  $q\->url(\-path=>1);
\&  $q\->url(\-full=>1,\-path=>1);

\&  $q\->self_url();

.Sp
We no longer read from \s-1STDIN\s0 when the Content-Length is not set,
preventing requests with no Content-Length from sometimes freezing.
This is consistent with the \s-1CGI RFC 3875,\s0 and is also consistent with
CGI::Simple.  However, the old behavior may have been expected by some
command-line uses of \s-1CGI\s0.pm.
.Sp
In addition, the \s-1DELETE HTTP\s0 verb is now supported.

.Sp
It has a new \f(CW\*(C`:bsd_glob\*(C'\fR export tag, intended to replace \f(CW\*(C`:glob\*(C'\fR.  Like
\&\f(CW\*(C`:glob\*(C'\fR it overrides \f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR with a function that does not split the glob
pattern into words, but, unlike \f(CW\*(C`:glob\*(C'\fR, it iterates properly in scalar
context, instead of returning the last file.

Together, these upgrades fix a problem with IO::Handle's \f(CW\*(C`getline\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`getlines\*(C'\fR methods.  When these methods are called on the special \s-1ARGV\s0
handle, the next file is automatically opened, as happens with the built-in
\&\f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`readline\*(C'\fR functions.  But, unlike the built-ins, these
methods were not respecting the caller's use of the open pragma and
applying the appropriate I/O layers to the newly-opened file
[rt.cpan.org #66474].

Locale::Currency, Locale::Country, Locale::Script) will continue to work, but
all new sets of codes will be added in the Locale::Codes namespace.
.Sp
The code2XXX, XXX2code, all_XXX_codes, and all_XXX_names functions now
support retired codes.  All codesets may be specified by a constant or
by their name now.  Previously, they were specified only by a constant.

The alias_code function exists for backward compatibility.  It has been
replaced by rename_country_code.  The alias_code function will be
removed some time after September, 2013.

another means to determine whether the object has overloading.  It was
never correct for it to call \f(CW\*(C`can\*(C'\fR, as overloading does not respect

Printing to an in-memory handle now works if the \f(CW$scalar\fR holds a reference,
stringifying the reference before modifying it.  References used to be
treated as empty strings.
.Sp
Printing to an in-memory handle no longer crashes if the \f(CW$scalar\fR happens to

The module's Perl code has been considerably simplified, roughly halving
the number of lines, with no change in functionality.  The \s-1XS\s0 code has
been refactored to reduce the size of the shared object by about 12%,
with no change in functionality.  More \s-1POSIX\s0 functions now have tests.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`sigsuspend\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`pause\*(C'\fR now run signal handlers before returning, as the
whole point of these two functions is to wait until a signal has
arrived, and then return \fIafter\fR it has been triggered.  Delayed, or
\&\*(L"safe\*(R", signals were preventing that from happening, possibly resulting in
race conditions [perl #107216].
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`POSIX::sleep\*(C'\fR is now a direct call into the underlying \s-1OS \s0\f(CW\*(C`sleep\*(C'\fR

Warnings that mention the names of lexical (\f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR) variables with
Unicode characters in them now respect the presence or absence of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR layer on the output handle, instead of outputting \s-1UTF8\s0

The compiled representation of formats is now stored via the \f(CW\*(C`mg_ptr\*(C'\fR of
their \f(CW\*(C`PERL_MAGIC_fm\*(C'\fR.  Previously it was stored in the string buffer,
beyond \f(CW\*(C`SvLEN()\*(C'\fR, the regular end of the string.  \f(CW\*(C`SvCOMPILED()\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`SvCOMPILED_{on,off}()\*(C'\fR now exist solely for compatibility for \s-1XS\s0 code.
The first is always 0, the other two now no-ops. (5.14.1)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Some global variables have been marked \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR, members in the interpreter
structure have been re-ordered, and the opcodes have been re-ordered.  The
op \f(CW\*(C`OP_AELEMFAST\*(C'\fR has been split into \f(CW\*(C`OP_AELEMFAST\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`OP_AELEMFAST_LEX\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When empting a hash of its elements (e.g., via undef(%h), or \f(CW%h\fR=()), HvARRAY
field is no longer temporarily zeroed.  Any destructors called on the freed
elements see the remaining elements.  Thus, \f(CW%h\fR=() becomes more like
\&\f(CW\*(C`delete $h{$_} for keys %h\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Boyer-Moore compiled scalars are now PVMGs, and the Boyer-Moore tables are now
stored via the mg_ptr of their \f(CW\*(C`PERL_MAGIC_bm\*(C'\fR.
Previously they were PVGVs, with the tables stored in
the string buffer, beyond \f(CW\*(C`SvLEN()\*(C'\fR.  This eliminates
the last place where the core stores data beyond \f(CW\*(C`SvLEN()\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Simplified logic in \f(CW\*(C`Perl_sv_magic()\*(C'\fR introduces a small change of
behavior for error cases involving unknown magic types.  Previously, if
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_sv_magic()\*(C'\fR was passed a magic type unknown to it, it would
.RS 4

Now it will always croak \*(L"Don't know how to handle magic of type \e\e%o\*(R", even
on read-only values, or SVs which already have the unknown magic type.

.IP "\(bu" 4
The experimental \f(CW\*(C`fetch_cop_label\*(C'\fR function has been renamed to
\&\f(CW\*(C`cop_fetch_label\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`cop_store_label\*(C'\fR function has been added to the \s-1API,\s0 but is
experimental.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIembedvar.h\fR has been simplified, and one level of macro indirection for
PL_* variables has been removed for the default (non-multiplicity)
configuration.  PERLVAR*() macros now directly expand their arguments to
tokens such as \f(CW\*(C`PL_defgv\*(C'\fR, instead of expanding to \f(CW\*(C`PL_Idefgv\*(C'\fR, with
\&\fIembedvar.h\fR defining a macro to map \f(CW\*(C`PL_Idefgv\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`PL_defgv\*(C'\fR.  \s-1XS\s0 code
which has unwarranted chumminess with the implementation may need updating.
.IP "\(bu" 4
An \s-1API\s0 has been added to explicitly choose whether to export \s-1XSUB\s0
symbols.  More detail can be found in the comments for commit e64345f8.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`is_gv_magical_sv\*(C'\fR function has been eliminated and merged with
\&\f(CW\*(C`gv_fetchpvn_flags\*(C'\fR.  It used to be called to determine whether a \s-1GV\s0
should be autovivified in rvalue context.  Now it has been replaced with a
new \f(CW\*(C`GV_ADDMG\*(C'\fR flag (not part of the \s-1API\s0).
.IP "\(bu" 4
The returned code point from the function \f(CW\*(C`utf8n_to_uvuni()\*(C'\fR
when the input is malformed \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 malformations are allowed, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR warnings are off is now the Unicode \s-1REPLACEMENT CHARACTER\s0
whenever the malformation is such that no well-defined code point can be
computed.  Previously the returned value was essentially garbage.  The
only malformations that have well-defined values are a zero-length
string (0 is the return), and overlong \s-1UTF\-8\s0 sequences.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Padlists are now marked \f(CW\*(C`AvREAL\*(C'\fR; i.e., reference-counted.  They have
always been reference-counted, but were not marked real, because \fIpad.c\fR
did its own clean-up, instead of using the usual clean-up code in \fIsv.c\fR.
That caused problems in thread cloning, so now the \f(CW\*(C`AvREAL\*(C'\fR flag is on,
but is turned off in \fIpad.c\fR right before the padlist is freed (after
\&\fIpad.c\fR has done its custom freeing of the pads).

All C files that make up the Perl core have been converted to \s-1UTF\-8.\s0

\&\f(CW\*(C`sv_catpvn_flags\*(C'\fR takes a couple of new internal-only flags,
\&\f(CW\*(C`SV_CATBYTES\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SV_CATUTF8\*(C'\fR, which tell it whether the char array to
be concatenated is \s-1UTF8. \s0 This allows for more efficient concatenation than
creating temporary SVs to pass to \f(CW\*(C`sv_catsv\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For \s-1XS AUTOLOAD\s0 subs, \f(CW$AUTOLOAD\fR is set once more, as it was in 5.6.0.  This
is in addition to setting \f(CW\*(C`SvPVX(cv)\*(C'\fR, for compatibility with 5.8 to 5.14.
See \*(L"Autoloading with XSUBs\*(R" in perlguts.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl now checks whether the array (the linearized isa) returned by a \s-1MRO\s0
plugin begins with the name of the class itself, for which the array was
created, instead of assuming that it does.  This prevents the first element
from being skipped during method lookup.  It also means that
\&\f(CW\*(C`mro::get_linear_isa\*(C'\fR may return an array with one more element than the
\&\s-1MRO\s0 plugin provided [perl #94306].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_curstash\*(C'\fR is now reference-counted.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There are now feature bundle hints in \f(CW\*(C`PL_hints\*(C'\fR (\f(CW$^H\fR) that version
declarations use, to avoid having to load \fIfeature.pm\fR.  One setting of
the hint bits indicates a \*(L"custom\*(R" feature bundle, which means that the
entries in \f(CW\*(C`%^H\*(C'\fR still apply.  \fIfeature.pm\fR uses that.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`HINT_FEATURE_MASK\*(C'\fR macro is defined in \fIperl.h\fR along with other
hints.  Other macros for setting and testing features and bundles are in
the new \fIfeature.h\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`FEATURE_IS_ENABLED\*(C'\fR (which has moved to
\&\fIfeature.h\fR) is no longer used throughout the codebase, but more specific
macros, e.g., \f(CW\*(C`FEATURE_SAY_IS_ENABLED\*(C'\fR, that are defined in \fIfeature.h\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIlib/feature.pm\fR is now a generated file, created by the new
\&\fIregen/feature.pl\fR script, which also generates \fIfeature.h\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Tied arrays are now always \f(CW\*(C`AvREAL\*(C'\fR.  If \f(CW@_\fR or \f(CW\*(C`DB::args\*(C'\fR is tied, it
is reified first, to make sure this is always the case.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Two new functions \f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uvchr_buf()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uvuni_buf()\*(C'\fR have
been added.  These are the same as \f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uvchr\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uvuni\*(C'\fR (which are now deprecated), but take an extra parameter
that is used to guard against reading beyond the end of the input
string.
See \*(L"utf8_to_uvchr_buf\*(R" in perlapi and \*(L"utf8_to_uvuni_buf\*(R" in perlapi.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The regular expression engine now does \s-1TRIE\s0 case insensitive matches
under Unicode. This may change the output of \f(CW\*(C`use re \*(Aqdebug\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR,
and will speed up various things.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There is a new \f(CW\*(C`wrap_op_checker()\*(C'\fR function, which provides a thread-safe
alternative to writing to \f(CW\*(C`PL_check\*(C'\fR directly.

A bug has been fixed that would cause a \*(L"Use of freed value in iteration\*(R"
error if the next two hash elements that would be iterated over are
deleted [perl #85026]. (5.14.1)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Deleting the current hash iterator (the hash element that would be returned
by the next call to \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR) in void context used not to free it
[perl #85026].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Deletion of methods via \f(CW\*(C`delete $Class::{method}\*(C'\fR syntax used to update
method caches if called in void context, but not scalar or list context.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When hash elements are deleted in void context, the internal hash entry is
now freed before the value is freed, to prevent destructors called by that
latter freeing from seeing the hash in an inconsistent state.  It was
possible to cause double-frees if the destructor freed the hash itself
[perl #100340].
.IP "\(bu" 4
A \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR optimization in Perl 5.12.0 to make it faster on empty hashes
caused \f(CW\*(C`each\*(C'\fR not to reset the iterator if called after the last element
was deleted.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Freeing deeply nested hashes no longer crashes [perl #44225].
.IP "\(bu" 4
It is possible from \s-1XS\s0 code to create hashes with elements that have no
values.  The hash element and slice operators used to crash
when handling these in lvalue context.  They now
produce a \*(L"Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted\*(R" error
message.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If list assignment to a hash or array triggered destructors that freed the
hash or array itself, a crash would ensue.  This is no longer the case
[perl #107440].
.IP "\(bu" 4
It used to be possible to free the typeglob of a localized array or hash
(e.g., \f(CW\*(C`local @{"x"}; delete $::{x}\*(C'\fR), resulting in a crash on scope exit.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Some core bugs affecting Hash::Util have been fixed: locking a hash
element that is a glob copy no longer causes the next assignment to it to
corrupt the glob (5.14.2), and unlocking a hash element that holds a
copy-on-write scalar no longer causes modifications to that scalar to
modify other scalars that were sharing the same string buffer.

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval $string\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR used not to
localize \f(CW\*(C`%^H\*(C'\fR during compilation if it

This makes \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN { $^H{foo}=7 }\*(C'\fR equivalent to

Creating a \s-1BEGIN\s0 block from \s-1XS\s0 code (via \f(CW\*(C`newXS\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`newATTRSUB\*(C'\fR) would,

.SS "Copy-on-write scalars"
.IX Subsection "Copy-on-write scalars"
Copy-on-write or shared hash key scalars
were introduced in 5.8.0, but most Perl code
did not encounter them (they were used mostly internally).  Perl
5.10.0 extended them, such that assigning \f(CW\*(C`_\|_PACKAGE_\|_\*(C'\fR or a
hash key to a scalar would make it copy-on-write.  Several parts
of Perl were not updated to account for them, but have now been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::decode\*(C'\fR had a nasty bug that would modify copy-on-write scalars'
string buffers in place (i.e., skipping the copy).  This could result in
hashes having two elements with the same key [perl #91834]. (5.14.2)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Lvalue subroutines were not allowing \s-1COW\s0 scalars to be returned.  This was
fixed for lvalue scalar context in Perl 5.12.3 and 5.14.0, but list context
was not fixed until this release.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Elements of restricted hashes (see the fields pragma) containing
copy-on-write values couldn't be deleted, nor could such hashes be cleared
(\f(CW\*(C`%hash = ()\*(C'\fR). (5.14.2)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Localizing a tied variable used to make it read-only if it contained a
copy-on-write string. (5.14.2)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning a copy-on-write string to a stash
element no longer causes a double free.  Regardless of this change, the
results of such assignments are still undefined.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning a copy-on-write string to a tied variable no longer stops that
variable from being tied if it happens to be a \s-1PVMG\s0 or \s-1PVLV\s0 internally.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Doing a substitution on a tied variable returning a copy-on-write
scalar used to cause an assertion failure or an \*(L"Attempt to free

This one is a regression from 5.12: In 5.14.0, the bitwise assignment
operators \f(CW\*(C`|=\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`^=\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`&=\*(C'\fR started leaving the left-hand side
undefined if it happened to be a copy-on-write string [perl #108480].

.SS "The debugger"
.IX Subsection "The debugger"
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIdumpvar.pl\fR, and therefore the \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR command in the debugger, have been
fixed to handle objects blessed into classes whose names contain \*(L"=\*(R".  The
contents of such objects used not to be dumped [perl #101814].
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \*(L"R\*(R" command for restarting a debugger session has been fixed to work on
Windows, or any other system lacking a \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::_SC_OPEN_MAX\*(C'\fR constant
[perl #87740].
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`#line 42 foo\*(C'\fR directive used not to update the arrays of lines used
by the debugger if it occurred in a string eval.  This was partially fixed
in 5.14, but it worked only for a single \f(CW\*(C`#line 42 foo\*(C'\fR in each eval.  Now
it works for multiple.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When subroutine calls are intercepted by the debugger, the name of the
subroutine or a reference to it is stored in \f(CW$DB::sub\fR, for the debugger
to access.  Sometimes (such as \f(CW\*(C`$foo = *bar; undef *bar; &$foo\*(C'\fR)
\&\f(CW$DB::sub\fR would be set to a name that could not be used to find the
subroutine, and so the debugger's attempt to call it would fail.  Now the
check to see whether a reference is needed is more robust, so those
problems should not happen anymore [rt.cpan.org #69862].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Every subroutine has a filename associated with it that the debugger uses.
The one associated with constant subroutines used to be misallocated when
cloned under threads.  Consequently, debugging threaded applications could
result in memory corruption [perl #96126].

\&\f(CW\*(C`defined(${"..."})\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`defined(*{"..."})\*(C'\fR, etc., used to

they had not been used yet.  This bug affected \f(CW\*(C`${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`${^UTF8CACHE}\*(C'\fR, among others.  It also used to return false if the
package name was given as well (\f(CW\*(C`${"::!"}\*(C'\fR) [perl #97978, #97492].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl 5.10.0 introduced a similar bug: \f(CW\*(C`defined(*{"foo"})\*(C'\fR where \*(L"foo\*(R"
represents the name of a built-in global variable used to return false if
the variable had never been used before, but only on the \fIfirst\fR call.
This, too, has been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Since 5.6.0, \f(CW\*(C`*{ ... }\*(C'\fR has been inconsistent in how it treats undefined
values.  It would die in strict mode or lvalue context for most undefined
values, but would be treated as the empty string (with a warning) for the
specific scalar return by \f(CW\*(C`undef()\*(C'\fR (\f(CW&PL_sv_undef\fR internally).  This
has been corrected.  \f(CW\*(C`undef()\*(C'\fR is now treated like other undefined
scalars, as in Perl 5.005.
.SS "Filehandle, last-accessed"
.IX Subsection "Filehandle, last-accessed"
Perl has an internal variable that stores the last filehandle to be
accessed.  It is used by \f(CW$.\fR and by \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eof\*(C'\fR without
arguments.
.IP "\(bu" 4
It used to be possible to set this internal variable to a glob copy and
then modify that glob copy to be something other than a glob, and still
have the last-accessed filehandle associated with the variable after
assigning a glob to it again:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    my $foo = *STDOUT;  # $foo is a glob copy
\&    <$foo>;             # $foo is now the last\-accessed handle
\&    $foo = 3;           # no longer a glob
\&    $foo = *STDERR;     # still the last\-accessed handle
.Ve
.Sp
Now the \f(CW\*(C`$foo = 3\*(C'\fR assignment unsets that internal variable, so there
is no last-accessed filehandle, just as if \f(CW\*(C`<$foo>\*(C'\fR had never
happened.
.Sp
This also prevents some unrelated handle from becoming the last-accessed
handle if \f(CW$foo\fR falls out of scope and the same internal \s-1SV\s0 gets used for
another handle [perl #97988].
.IP "\(bu" 4
A regression in 5.14 caused these statements not to set that internal
variable:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    my $fh = *STDOUT;
\&    tell $fh;
\&    eof  $fh;
\&    seek $fh, 0,0;
\&    tell     *$fh;
\&    eof      *$fh;
\&    seek     *$fh, 0,0;
\&    readline *$fh;
.Ve
.Sp
This is now fixed, but \f(CW\*(C`tell *{ *$fh }\*(C'\fR still has the problem, and it
is not clear how to fix it [perl #106536].

Redefinition warnings for constant subroutines are on by default (what

\&\f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR now work on copies of globs, instead of dying.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`splice()\*(C'\fR doesn't warn when truncating
.Sp
You can now limit the size of an array using \f(CW\*(C`splice(@a,MAX_LEN)\*(C'\fR without
worrying about warnings.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$$\fR is no longer tainted.  Since this value comes directly from
\&\f(CW\*(C`getpid()\*(C'\fR, it is always safe.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The parser no longer leaks a filehandle if \s-1STDIN\s0 was closed before parsing
started [perl #37033].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`die;\*(C'\fR with a non-reference, non-string, or magical (e.g., tainted)
value in $@ now properly propagates that value [perl #111654].

On Solaris, we have two kinds of failure.
.Sp
If \fImake\fR is Sun's \fImake\fR, we get an error about a badly formed macro
assignment in the \fIMakefile\fR.  That happens when \fI./Configure\fR tries to
make depends.  \fIConfigure\fR then exits 0, but further \fImake\fR\-ing fails.
.Sp
If \fImake\fR is \fIgmake\fR, \fIConfigure\fR completes, then we get errors related
to \fI/usr/include/stdbool.h\fR

On Win32, a number of tests hang unless \s-1STDERR\s0 is redirected.  The cause of
this is still under investigation.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When building as root with a umask that prevents files from being
other-readable, \fIt/op/filetest.t\fR will fail.  This is a test bug, not a
bug in perl's behavior.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Configuring with a recent gcc and link-time-optimization, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`Configure \-Doptimize=\*(Aq\-O2 \-flto\*(Aq\*(C'\fR fails
because the optimizer optimizes away some of Configure's tests.  A
workaround is to omit the \f(CW\*(C`\-flto\*(C'\fR flag when running Configure, but add
it back in while actually building, something like
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    sh Configure \-Doptimize=\-O2                                             
\&    make OPTIMIZE=\*(Aq\-O2 \-flto\*(Aq

The following \s-1CPAN\s0 modules have test failures with perl 5.16.  Patches have
been submitted for all of these, so hopefully there will be new releases
soon:

.IP "\(bu" 4
Date::Pcalc version 6.1
.IP "\(bu" 4
Module::CPANTS::Analyse version 0.85
.Sp
This fails due to problems in Module::Find 0.10 and File::MMagic
1.27.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0
modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0
community for helping Perl to flourish.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at <http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/>.  There may also be
information at <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
send it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all core
committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure
out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is
supported.  Please use this address only for security issues in the Perl
core, not for modules independently distributed on \s-1CPAN.\s0

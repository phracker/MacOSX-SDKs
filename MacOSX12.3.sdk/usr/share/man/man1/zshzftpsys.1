.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This describes the set of shell functions supplied with the source
distribution as an interface to the \fBzftp\fP builtin command, allowing you
to perform FTP operations from the shell command line or within functions
or scripts\&.  The interface is similar to a traditional FTP client (e\&.g\&. the
\fBftp\fP command itself, see \fIftp\fP(1)), but as it is entirely done
within the shell all the familiar completion, editing and globbing features,
and so on, are present, and macros are particularly simple to write as they
are just ordinary shell functions\&.
.PP
The prerequisite is that the \fBzftp\fP command, as described in
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)
, must be available in the
version of \fBzsh\fP installed at your site\&.  If the shell is configured to
load new commands at run time, it probably is: typing `\fBzmodload zsh/zftp\fP\&'
will make sure (if that runs silently, it has worked)\&.  If this is not the
case, it is possible \fBzftp\fP was linked into the shell anyway: to test
this, type `\fBwhich zftp\fP\&' and if \fBzftp\fP is available you will get the
message `\fBzftp: shell built\-in command\fP\&'\&.
.PP
Commands given directly with \fBzftp\fP builtin may be interspersed between
the functions in this suite; in a few cases, using \fBzftp\fP directly may
cause some of the status information stored in shell parameters to become
invalid\&.  Note in particular the description of the variables
\fB$ZFTP_TMOUT\fP, \fB$ZFTP_PREFS\fP and \fB$ZFTP_VERBOSE\fP for \fBzftp\fP\&.

.SH "INSTALLATION"
.PP
You should make sure all the functions from the \fBFunctions/Zftp\fP
directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with the
two letters `\fBzf\fP\&'\&.  They may already have been installed on your system;
otherwise, you will need to find them and copy them\&.  The directory should
appear as one of the elements of the \fB$fpath\fP array (this should already
be the case if they were installed), and at least the function \fBzfinit\fP
should be autoloaded; it will autoload the rest\&.  Finally, to initialize
the use of the system you need to call the \fBzfinit\fP function\&.  The
following code in your \fB\&.zshrc\fP will arrange for this; assume the
functions are stored in the directory \fB~/myfns\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfpath=(~/myfns $fpath)
autoload \-U zfinit
zfinit\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that \fBzfinit\fP assumes you are using the \fBzmodload\fP method to
load the \fBzftp\fP command\&.  If it is already built into the shell, change
\fBzfinit\fP to \fBzfinit \-n\fP\&.  It is helpful (though not essential) if the
call to \fBzfinit\fP appears after any code to initialize the new completion
system, else unnecessary \fBcompctl\fP commands will be given\&.
.PP
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.PP
The sequence of operations in performing a file transfer is essentially the
same as that in a standard FTP client\&.  Note that, due to a quirk of the
shell\&'s \fBgetopts\fP builtin, for those functions that handle options you
must use `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' rather than `\fB\-\fP' to ensure the remaining arguments
are treated literally (a single `\fB\-\fP\&' is treated as an argument)\&.

\fBzfparams\fP [ \fIhost\fP [ \fIuser\fP [ \fIpassword\fP \&.\&.\&. ] ] ]
Set or show the parameters for a future \fBzfopen\fP with no arguments\&.  If
no arguments are given, the current parameters are displayed (the password
will be shown as a line of asterisks)\&.  If a \fIhost\fP is given, and either the
\fIuser\fP or \fIpassword\fP is not, they will be prompted for; also, any
parameter given as `\fB?\fP\&' will be prompted for, and if the `\fB?\fP' is
followed by a string, that will be used as the prompt\&.  As \fBzfopen\fP calls
\fBzfparams\fP to store the parameters, this usually need not be called
directly\&.
.RS
.PP
A single argument `\fB\-\fP\&' will delete the stored parameters\&.  This will
also cause the memory of the last directory (and so on) on the other host
to be deleted\&.
.RE

\fBzfopen\fP [ \fB\-1\fP ] [ \fIhost\fP [ \fIuser\fP [ \fIpassword\fP [ \fIaccount\fP ] ] ] ]
If \fIhost\fP is present, open a connection to that host under username
\fIuser\fP with password \fIpassword\fP (and, on the rare occasions when it
is necessary, account \fIaccount\fP)\&.  If a necessary parameter is missing or
given as `\fB?\fP\&' it will be prompted for\&.  If \fIhost\fP is not present, use
a previously stored set of parameters\&.
.RS
.PP
If the command was successful, and the terminal is compatible with
\fBxterm\fP or is \fBsun\-cmd\fP, a summary will appear in the title bar,
giving the local \fBhost:directory\fP and the remote \fBhost:directory\fP;
this is handled by the function \fBzftp_chpwd\fP, described below\&.
.PP
Normally, the \fIhost\fP, \fIuser\fP and \fIpassword\fP are internally
recorded for later re\-opening, either by a \fBzfopen\fP with no arguments, or
automatically (see below)\&.  With the option `\fB\-1\fP\&', no information is
stored\&.  Also, if an open command with arguments failed, the parameters
will not be retained (and any previous parameters will also be deleted)\&.
A \fBzfopen\fP on its own, or a \fBzfopen \-1\fP, never alters the stored
parameters\&.
.PP
Both \fBzfopen\fP and \fBzfanon\fP (but not \fBzfparams\fP) understand URLs of
the form \fBftp://\fP\fIhost\fP/\fIpath\&.\&.\&.\fP as meaning to connect to the
\fIhost\fP, then change directory to \fIpath\fP (which must be a directory,
not a file)\&.  The `\fBftp://\fP\&' can be omitted; the trailing `\fB/\fP' is enough
to trigger recognition of the \fIpath\fP\&.  Note prefixes other than
`\fBftp:\fP\&' are not recognized, and that all characters after the first
slash beyond \fIhost\fP are significant in \fIpath\fP\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBzfanon\fP [ \fB\-1\fP ] \fIhost\fP
Open a connection \fIhost\fP for anonymous FTP\&.  The username used is
`\fBanonymous\fP\&'\&.  The password (which will be reported the first time) is
generated as \fIuser\fP\fB@\fP\fIhost\fP; this is then stored in the shell
parameter \fB$EMAIL_ADDR\fP which can alternatively be set manually to a
suitable string\&.

Change the current directory on the remote server:  this is implemented to

.RS
.PP
In the first form with \fIdir\fP present, change to the directory \fIdir\fP\&.
The command `\fBzfcd \&.\&.\fP\&' is treated specially, so is guaranteed to work on
non\-UNIX servers (note this is handled internally by \fBzftp\fP)\&.  If \fIdir\fP
is omitted, has the effect of `\fBzfcd ~\fP\&'\&.
.PP
The second form changes to the directory previously current\&.
.PP
The third form attempts to change the current directory by replacing the
first occurrence of the string \fIold\fP with the string \fInew\fP in the
current directory\&.
.PP
Note that in this command, and indeed anywhere a remote filename is
expected, the string which on the local host corresponds to `\fB~\fP\&' is
converted back to a `\fB~\fP\&' before being passed to the remote machine\&.
This is convenient because of the way expansion is performed on the command
line before \fBzfcd\fP receives a string\&.  For example, suppose the command
is `\fBzfcd ~/foo\fP\&'\&.  The shell will expand this to a full path such as
`\fBzfcd /home/user2/pws/foo\fP\&'\&.  At this stage, \fBzfcd\fP recognises the
initial path as corresponding to `\fB~\fP\&' and will send the directory to
the remote host as \fB~/foo\fP, so that the `\fB~\fP\&' will be expanded by the
server to the correct remote host directory\&.  Other named directories of
the form `\fB~name\fP\&' are not treated in this fashion\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBzfhere\fP
Change directory on the remote server to the one corresponding to the
current local directory, with special handling of `\fB~\fP\&' as in \fBzfcd\fP\&.
For example, if the current local directory is \fB~/foo/bar\fP, then
\fBzfhere\fP performs the effect of `\fBzfcd ~/foo/bar\fP\&'\&.

\fBzfdir\fP [ \fB\-rfd\fP ] [ \fB\-\fP ] [ \fIdir\-options\fP ] [ \fIdir\fP ]
Produce a long directory listing\&.  The arguments \fIdir\-options\fP and
\fIdir\fP are passed directly to the server and their effect is
implementation dependent, but specifying a particular remote directory
\fIdir\fP is usually possible\&.  The output is passed through a pager
given by the environment variable \fB$PAGER\fP, or `\fBmore\fP\&' if that is not
set\&.
.RS
.PP
The directory is usually cached for re\-use\&.  In fact, two caches are
maintained\&.  One is for use when there is no \fIdir\-options\fP or \fIdir\fP,
i\&.e\&. a full listing of the current remote directory; it is flushed
when the current remote directory changes\&.  The other is
kept for repeated use of \fBzfdir\fP with the same arguments; for example,
repeated use of `\fBzfdir /pub/gnu\fP\&' will only require the directory to be
retrieved on the first call\&.  Alternatively, this cache can be re\-viewed with
the \fB\-r\fP option\&.  As relative directories will confuse
\fBzfdir\fP, the \fB\-f\fP option can be used to force the cache to be flushed
before the directory is listed\&.  The option \fB\-d\fP will delete both
caches without showing a directory listing; it will also delete the cache
of file names in the current remote directory, if any\&.

\fBzfls\fP [ \fIls\-options\fP ] [ \fIdir\fP ]

\fBzfget\fP [ \fB\-Gtc\fP ] \fIfile1\fP \&.\&.\&.

remote server, but the file is stored locally under the name given by the
part after the final `\fB/\fP\&'\&.  The option \fB\-c\fP (cat) forces all files to
be sent as a single stream to standard output; in this case the \fB\-t\fP
option has no effect\&.

\fBzfuget\fP [ \fB\-Gvst\fP ] \fIfile1\fP \&.\&.\&.
As \fBzfget\fP, but only retrieve files where the version on the remote
server is newer (has a later modification time), or where the local file
does not exist\&.  If the remote file is older but the files have different
sizes, or if the sizes are the same but the remote file is newer, the user
will usually be queried\&.  With the option \fB\-s\fP, the command runs silently
and will always retrieve the file in either of those two cases\&.  With the
option \fB\-v\fP, the command prints more information about the files while it
is working out whether or not to transfer them\&.

\fBzfcget\fP [ \fB\-Gt\fP ] \fIfile1\fP \&.\&.\&.
As \fBzfget\fP, but if any of the local files exists, and is shorter than

With the option \fB\-r\fP, if any of the \fIfiles\fP are directories they are

command `\fBzstyle \&':zftp:*'\fP \fIstyle\fP \fIvalue\fP \&.\&.\&.'\&.
defines the \fIstyle\fP to have value \fIvalue\fP; more than one value may be
given, although that is not useful in the cases described here\&.  These
values will then be used throughout the zftp function system\&.  For more
precise control, the first argument, which gives a context in which the
style applies, can be modified to include a particular function, as for
example `\fB:zftp:zfget\fP\&': the style will then have the given value only
in the \fBzfget\fP function\&.  Values for the same style in different contexts
may be set; the most specific function will be used, where
strings are held to be more specific than patterns, and longer patterns and
shorter patterns\&.  Note that only the top level function name, as called by

terminal be available via the \fB$COLUMNS\fP parameter (normally this is set
automatically)\&.  If the size of the file being transferred is not
available, \fBbar\fP and \fBpercent\fP meters will simply show the number of
bytes transferred so far\&.

When \fBzfinit\fP is run, if this style is not defined for the context
\fB:zftp:*\fP, it will be set to `bar\&'\&.

\fBupdate\fP
Specifies the minimum time interval between updates of the progress meter
in seconds\&.  No update is made unless new data has been received, so the
actual time interval is limited only by \fB$ZFTP_TIMEOUT\fP\&.

As described for \fBprogress\fP, \fBzfinit\fP will force this to default to 1\&.

\fBremote\-glob\fP
If set to `\fB1\fP\&', `\fByes\fP' or `\fBtrue\fP', filename generation (globbing) is
performed on the remote machine instead of by zsh itself; see below\&.
.TP
\fBtitlebar\fP
If set to `\fB1\fP\&', `\fByes\fP' or `\fBtrue\fP', \fBzftp_chpwd\fP will put the remote host and
remote directory into the titlebar of terminal emulators such as xterm or
sun\-cmd that allow this\&.

\fBchpwd\fP
If set to `\fB1\fP\&' `\fByes\fP' or `\fBtrue\fP', \fBzftp_chpwd\fP will call the function
\fBchpwd\fP when a connection is closed\&.  This is useful if the remote host
details were put into the terminal title bar by \fBzftp_chpwd\fP and your
usual \fBchpwd\fP also modifies the title bar\&.

When \fBzfinit\fP is run, it will determine whether \fBchpwd\fP exists and if
so it will set the default value for the style to 1 if none exists
already\&.

Note that there is also an associative array \fBzfconfig\fP which contains
values used by the function system\&.  This should not be modified or
overwritten\&.

.SS "Remote globbing"
.PP
The commands for retrieving files usually perform filename generation
(globbing) on their arguments; this can be turned off by passing the option
\fB\-G\fP to each of the commands\&.  Normally this operates by retrieving a
complete list of files for the directory in question, then matching these
locally against the pattern supplied\&.  This has the advantage that the full
range of zsh patterns (respecting the setting of the option
\fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP) can be used\&.  However, it means that the directory part
of a filename will not be expanded and must be given exactly\&.  If the
remote server does not support the UNIX directory semantics, directory
handling is problematic and it is recommended that globbing only be used
within the current directory\&.  The list of files in the current directory,
if retrieved, will be cached, so that subsequent globs in the same
directory without an intervening \fBzfcd\fP are much faster\&.
.PP
If the \fBremote\-glob\fP style (see above) is set, globbing is instead
performed on the remote host: the server is asked for a list of matching
files\&.  This is highly dependent on how the server is implemented, though
typically UNIX servers will provide support for basic glob patterns\&.  This
may in some cases be faster, as it avoids retrieving the entire list of
directory contents\&.
.PP
.SS "Automatic and temporary reopening"
.PP
As described for the \fBzfopen\fP command, a subsequent \fBzfopen\fP with no
parameters will reopen the connection to the last host (this includes
connections made with the \fBzfanon\fP command)\&.  Opened in this fashion, the
connection starts in the default remote directory and will remain open
until explicitly closed\&.
.PP
Automatic re\-opening is also available\&.  If a connection is not currently
open and a command requiring a connection is given, the last connection is
implicitly reopened\&.  In this case the directory which was current when the
connection was closed again becomes the current directory (unless, of
course, the command given changes it)\&.  Automatic reopening will also take
place if the connection was close by the remote server for whatever reason
(e\&.g\&. a timeout)\&.  It is not available if the \fB\-1\fP option to \fBzfopen\fP
or \fBzfanon\fP was used\&.
.PP
Furthermore, if the command issued is a file transfer, the connection will
be closed after the transfer is finished, hence providing a one\-shot mode
for transfers\&.  This does not apply to directory changing or listing
commands; for example a \fBzfdir\fP may reopen a connection but will leave it
open\&.  Also, automatic closure will only ever happen in the same command as
automatic opening, i\&.e a \fBzfdir\fP directly followed by a \fBzfget\fP will
never close the connection automatically\&.
.PP
Information about the previous connection is given by the \fBzfstat\fP
function\&.  So, for example, if that reports:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBSession:        default
Not connected\&.
Last session:   ftp\&.bar\&.com:/pub/textfiles\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
then the command \fBzfget file\&.txt\fP will attempt to reopen a connection to
\fBftp\&.bar\&.com\fP, retrieve the file \fB/pub/textfiles/file\&.txt\fP, and
immediately close the connection again\&.  On the other hand, \fBzfcd \&.\&.\fP
will open the connection in the directory \fB/pub\fP and leave it open\&.
.PP
Note that all the above is local to each session; if you return to a
previous session, the connection for that session is the one which will be
reopened\&.
.PP
.SS "Completion"
.PP
Completion of local and remote files, directories, sessions and bookmarks
is supported\&.  The older, \fBcompctl\fP\-style completion is defined when
\fBzfinit\fP is called; support for the new widget\-based completion system is
provided in the function \fBCompletion/Zsh/Command/_zftp\fP, which should be
installed with the other functions of the completion system and hence
should automatically be available\&.

.SH NAME
syscallbyproc.d \- syscalls by process name. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B syscallbyproc.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
syscallbyproc.d is a DTrace OneLiner to a report of the number of 
system calls made by process name. 

This is useful to identify which process is causing the most 
system calls.

Docs/oneliners.txt and Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt
in the DTraceToolkit contain this as a oneliner that can be cut-n-paste
to run.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.

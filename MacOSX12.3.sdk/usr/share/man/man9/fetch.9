.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions are designed to copy small amounts of data from user-space.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines provide the following functionality:
.Bl -tag -width "fuiword()"
.\" ==========
.It Fn fubyte
Fetches a byte of data from the user-space address
.Pa addr .
.\" ==========
.It Fn fuibyte
Fetches a byte of data from the user-space address
.Pa addr .
This function is safe to call during an interrupt context.
.\" ==========
.It Fn fuiword
Fetches a word of data from the user-space address
.Pa addr .
This function is safe to call during an interrupt context.
.\" ==========
.It Fn fulong
Fetches a long word of data from the user-space address
.Pa addr .
.\" ==========
.It Fn fuulong
Fetches a unsigned long word of data from the user-space address
.Pa addr .
.\" ==========
.It Fn fuword
Fetches a word of data from the user-space address
.Pa addr .

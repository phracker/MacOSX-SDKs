.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides the standard script application
.Dq shell
for an Open Scripting Architecture
.Pq OSA
script.  It provides a menu bar and optional splash dialog, and handles routing incoming
Apple events to the script, notably the
.Li run
and
.Li open
events.  It is normally used as the interpreter for a script file, like this:
.Pp
.D1 Li #!/usr/libexec/osaapplet
.Pp
The script, which may be compiled script data, may either follow the interpreter line or be
a separate file in the traditional bundle location
.Li Resources/Scripts/main.scpt Ns No .
.Nm
assumes that it is running inside a bundle; running it without a bundle may produce
unexpected results.
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was introduced in OS X 10.10.

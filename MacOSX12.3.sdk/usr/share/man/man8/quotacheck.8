.Sh NAME
.Nm quotacheck
.Nd filesystem quota consistency checker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm quotacheck
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Ar filesystem Ar ...
.Nm quotacheck
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Quotacheck
examines each filesystem,
builds a table of current disk usage,
and compares this table against that recorded
in the disk quota file for the filesystem.
If any inconsistencies are detected, both the
quota file and the current system copy of the
incorrect quotas are updated (the latter only
occurs if an active filesystem is checked).
By default both user and group quotas are checked.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
If the
.Fl a
flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
.Nm quotacheck
will check all the read-write filesystems with an existing
mount option file at its root.
The mount option file specifies the types of quotas that
are to be checked.
.It Fl g
Only group quotas are checked. The mount option file,
.Pa .quota.ops.group ,
must exist at the root of the filesystem.
.It Fl u
Only user quotas are checked.  The mount option file,
.Pa .quota.ops.user ,
must exist at the root of the filesystem.
.It Fl v
.Nm quotacheck
reports discrepancies between the
calculated and recorded disk quotas.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
is equivalent to the default.
Parallel passes are run on the filesystems required,
in an identical fashion to
.Xr fsck 8 .
.Pp
Normally
.Nm quotacheck
operates silently.
.Pp
.Nm Quotacheck
expects each filesystem being checked to have
quota data files named
.Pa .quota.user
and/or
.Pa .quota.group
located at the filesystem root.
If a binary data file is not present, 
.Nm quotacheck
will create it.
The default filename and root location cannot be overridden.
.Pp
.Nm Quotacheck
is normally run at 
.Pa fsck
time.
.Pp
.Nm Quotacheck
accesses the raw device in calculating the actual
disk usage for each user.
Thus, the filesystems
checked should be quiescent while
.Nm quotacheck
is running.
.Sh FILES
Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the
mounted filesystem.  The mount option files are empty files
whose existence indicates that quotas are to be enabled
for that filesystem. The binary data files will be created by 
quotacheck, if they don't already exist.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width .quota.ops.group -compact
.It Pa .quota.user
data file containing user quotas
.It Pa .quota.group
data file containing group quotas
.It Pa .quota.ops.user
mount option file used to enable user quotas
.It Pa .quota.ops.group
mount option file used to enable group quotas

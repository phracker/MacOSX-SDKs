.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility attempts to determine what sort of volume is present on the given
device.
It operates by iterating over directories that are typically part of the path,
searching for files matching the pattern fstyp_* and running them.
If it finds a match, it will print out the file system type name and exit with
a return value of 1.
If it does not find a match, it will not print out anything, and the return
value will be 0.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_hfs
command attaches the HFS file system residing on the device
.Pa special
to the global file system namespace at the location indicated by
.Pa directory .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl u Ar user
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Pa user . 
The default owner is the owner of the directory on which
the file system is being mounted.
The
.Pa user
may be a user-name, or a numeric value.
.It Fl g Ar group
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Pa group . 
The default group is the group of the directory on which
the file system is being mounted.
The
.Pa group
may be a group-name, or a numeric value.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files in the file system.
(For example, a
.Pa mask
of 755 specifies that, by default, the owner should have read, write,
and execute permissions for files, but others should only have read
and execute permissions.  See chmod(1) for more information about
octal file modes.)  Only the nine low-order bits of
.Pa mask
are used.  The default
.Pa mask
is taken from the directory on which the file system is being mounted.

.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the

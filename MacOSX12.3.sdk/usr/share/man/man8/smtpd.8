Postfix SMTP server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBsmtpd\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]

\fBsendmail \-bs\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The SMTP server accepts network connection requests
and performs zero or more SMTP transactions per connection.
Each received message is piped through the \fBcleanup\fR(8)
daemon, and is placed into the \fBincoming\fR queue as one
single queue file.  For this mode of operation, the program
expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process manager.

Alternatively, the SMTP server be can run in stand\-alone
mode; this is traditionally obtained with "\fBsendmail
\-bs\fR".  When the SMTP server runs stand\-alone with non
$\fBmail_owner\fR privileges, it receives mail even while
the mail system is not running, deposits messages directly
into the \fBmaildrop\fR queue, and disables the SMTP server's
access policies. As of Postfix version 2.3, the SMTP server
refuses to receive mail from the network when it runs with
non $\fBmail_owner\fR privileges.

The SMTP server implements a variety of policies for connection
requests, and for parameters given to \fBHELO, ETRN, MAIL FROM, VRFY\fR
and \fBRCPT TO\fR commands. They are detailed below and in the
\fBmain.cf\fR configuration file.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The SMTP server is moderately security\-sensitive. It talks to SMTP
clients and to DNS servers on the network. The SMTP server can be
run chrooted at fixed low privilege.

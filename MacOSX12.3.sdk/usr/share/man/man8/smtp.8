Postfix SMTP+LMTP client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBsmtp\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix SMTP+LMTP client implements the SMTP and LMTP mail
delivery protocols. It processes message delivery requests from
the queue manager. Each request specifies a queue file, a sender
address, a domain or host to deliver to, and recipient information.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

The SMTP+LMTP client updates the queue file and marks recipients
as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should
be tried again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent
to the \fBbounce\fR(8), \fBdefer\fR(8) or \fBtrace\fR(8) daemon as
appropriate.

The SMTP+LMTP client looks up a list of mail exchanger addresses for
the destination host, sorts the list by preference, and connects
to each listed address until it finds a server that responds.

When a server is not reachable, or when mail delivery fails due
to a recoverable error condition, the SMTP+LMTP client will try to
deliver the mail to an alternate host.

After a successful mail transaction, a connection may be saved
to the \fBscache\fR(8) connection cache server, so that it
may be used by any SMTP+LMTP client for a subsequent transaction.

By default, connection caching is enabled temporarily for
destinations that have a high volume of mail in the active
queue. Connection caching can be enabled permanently for
specific destinations.
.SH "SMTP DESTINATION SYNTAX"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
SMTP destinations have the following form:
.IP \fIdomainname\fR
.IP \fIdomainname\fR:\fIport\fR
Look up the mail exchangers for the specified domain, and
connect to the specified port (default: \fBsmtp\fR).
.IP [\fIhostname\fR]
.IP [\fIhostname\fR]:\fIport\fR
Look up the address(es) of the specified host, and connect to
the specified port (default: \fBsmtp\fR).
.IP [\fIaddress\fR]
.IP [\fIaddress\fR]:\fIport\fR
Connect to the host at the specified address, and connect
to the specified port (default: \fBsmtp\fR). An IPv6 address
must be formatted as [\fBipv6\fR:\fIaddress\fR].
.SH "LMTP DESTINATION SYNTAX"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
LMTP destinations have the following form:
.IP \fBunix\fR:\fIpathname\fR
Connect to the local UNIX\-domain server that is bound to the specified
\fIpathname\fR. If the process runs chrooted, an absolute pathname
is interpreted relative to the Postfix queue directory.
.IP \fBinet\fR:\fIhostname\fR
.IP \fBinet\fR:\fIhostname\fR:\fIport\fR
.IP \fBinet\fR:[\fIaddress\fR]
.IP \fBinet\fR:[\fIaddress\fR]:\fIport\fR
Connect to the specified TCP port on the specified local or
remote host. If no port is specified, connect to the port defined as
\fBlmtp\fR in \fBservices\fR(4).
If no such service is found, the \fBlmtp_tcp_port\fR configuration
parameter (default value of 24) will be used.
An IPv6 address must be formatted as [\fBipv6\fR:\fIaddress\fR].
.PP
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The SMTP+LMTP client is moderately security\-sensitive. It
talks to SMTP or LMTP servers and to DNS servers on the
network. The SMTP+LMTP client can be run chrooted at fixed
low privilege.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
Corrupted message files are marked so that the queue manager can
move them to the \fBcorrupt\fR queue for further inspection.

Depending on the setting of the \fBnotify_classes\fR parameter,
the postmaster is notified of bounces, protocol problems, and of
other trouble.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
SMTP and LMTP connection caching does not work with TLS. The necessary
support for TLS object passivation and re\-activation does not
exist without closing the session, which defeats the purpose.

SMTP and LMTP connection caching assumes that SASL credentials
are valid for all destinations that map onto the same IP
address and TCP port.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Before Postfix version 2.3, the LMTP client is a separate
program that implements only a subset of the functionality
available with SMTP: there is no support for TLS, and
connections are cached in\-process, making it ineffective
when the client is used for multiple domains.

Most smtp_\fIxxx\fR configuration parameters have an
lmtp_\fIxxx\fR "mirror" parameter for the equivalent LMTP
feature. This document describes only those LMTP\-related
parameters that aren't simply "mirror" parameters.

Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically, as \fBsmtp\fR(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]kernelmanagerd\f[R] is the kernel extension server.
It runs as a standalone \f[B]launchd(8)\f[R] daemon to handle requests
from the kernel, and from other user-space processes to load kernel
extensions (kexts) if they are available in a loaded \f[B]kext
collection\f[R] (see \f[B]kmutil(8)\f[R]).
If a kext is requested for load that is not yet available for loading,
\f[B]kernelmanagerd\f[R] will build the kext into the \f[B]auxiliary
kext collection\f[R] for use on the next reboot.
It is also responsible for launching \f[B]driver extensions\f[R] on the
system.
.PP
The KernelManagement utility \f[B]kmutil(8)\f[R] can interact with
\f[B]kernelmanagerd\f[R] for requesting loads and unloads of kernel
extensions, and for querying the daemon\[cq]s state.
.PP
\f[B]kernelmanagerd\f[R] watches the \f[B]/Library/Extensions\f[R]
directory for changes, to support installation and removal of kexts with
installers.

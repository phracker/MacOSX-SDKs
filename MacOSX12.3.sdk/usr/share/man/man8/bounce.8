\fBbounce\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBbounce\fR(8) daemon maintains per\-message log files with
delivery status information. Each log file is named after the
queue file that it corresponds to, and is kept in a queue subdirectory
named after the service name in the \fBmaster.cf\fR file (either
\fBbounce\fR, \fBdefer\fR or \fBtrace\fR).
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

The \fBbounce\fR(8) daemon processes two types of service requests:
.IP \(bu
Append a recipient (non\-)delivery status record to a per\-message
log file.
.IP \(bu
Enqueue a delivery status notification message, with a copy
of a per\-message log file and of the corresponding message.
When the delivery status notification message is
enqueued successfully, the per\-message log file is deleted.
.PP
The software does a best notification effort. A non\-delivery
notification is sent even when the log file or the original
message cannot be read.

Optionally, a bounce (defer, trace) client can request that the
per\-message log file be deleted when the requested operation fails.
This is used by clients that cannot retry transactions by
themselves, and that depend on retry logic in their own client.

of mail that cannot be delivered within $delay_warning_time time
units.

the SMTP greeting banner, and in bounced mail.

.IP "\fBsyslog_facility (mail)\fR"
The syslog facility of Postfix logging.
.IP "\fBsyslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"

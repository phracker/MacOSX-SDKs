.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
is a system daemon that implements a policy for the task_for_pid system service.
When the kernel is asked for the task port of a process, and preliminary access control
checks pass, it invokes this daemon (via launchd) to make the decision.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Differs from above in tag removed 
.It Fl t Ar timeout
The daemon will quit after that many seconds of inactivity. It will be relaunched
by launchd as needed. A timeout of zero can be specified to make the daemon quit
after servicing each request, but a small positive timeout is better for performance.
.It Fl i Ar pid
Inject the service port of
.Nm
into the process with the given pid, rather than relying on launchd to install it
system-wide. This is for testing only, and requires the launchd configuration for
.Nm
to be removed.

access to task ports. A value of "safe" bypasses authorization checks if so configured.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was first introduced in Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard).
.Pp
Procmod and procview support (-p) was removed in 10.11.
.Pp
Certain software updates of Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger) introduced the convention
requiring membership in the procmod or procview groups to control task port
access. Before that, any process could obtain the task port of any other process
with the same user-id.

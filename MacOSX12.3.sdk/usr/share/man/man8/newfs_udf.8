.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm newfs_udf
command builds the UDF filesystem on the specified special device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
General options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl N
Causes the file system parameters to be printed out without really creating the file system.
.It Fl w
Stop processing on warnings, default: no
.It Fl -wipefs Ar yes|no
Whether wipe existing file systems on the volume before formatting it.  Default: wipe existing
file systems when media-type is block device (blk), access-type is overwrite (ow), and the Keep Disc Open
option (-o) is not specified; do not wipe existing file systems by default in all other cases.
.It Fl -largesparse
Format the volume to use a non UDF-compliant format to efficiently support very large sparse files (up to 2^63 - 1, or 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 bytes).  Sparse files on this volume that has holes larger than 1GB cannot be accessed by
other UDF implementations.
.Pp
.El
Disc properties:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.Pp
.It Fl b Ar block-size
The block size of the file system, in bytes, default: the native block size of the device, or 2048 for an image file
.It Fl d
The file system manages defects by creating a sparable partition, default: no
.It Fl e
Use extended file entry instead of file entry, default: no
.It Fl E Ar ecc-in-blks
ECC block size in number of blocks
.It Fl m Ar media-type
The type of the media, can be blk (block device), var-packet (varible size packet writing), fix-packet (fixed size
packet writing), or pow (pseudo overwrite), default: blk
.It Fl t Ar access-type
The access type of the partition, can be wo (writeonce), ow (overwrite), or pow (pseudo overwrite), default: ow
.It Fl o
Keep the disc as open by only writing the first AVDP (e.g., background formating haven't finish, so the write of the
last two AVDPs is not possible), default: close the disc for overwrite media, and keep it open for write once media
.It Fl p Ar packet-size
The size of a packet in number of blocks, default: 1
.It Fl s Ar size
Size of the file system in blocks, default: size of the device
.Pp
.El
UDF parameters:
.Pp
General:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl r Ar rev
UDF version number, can be 1.02, 1.50, 2.00, 2.01, 2.50, or 2.60, default: 2.01
.It Fl u
Creates unique id table (or unique id stream), default: no
.It Fl -unalloc-spc Ar blk-addr num-blks
Unallocated space recorded in unallocated space descriptor, default: no unallocated spc
.It Fl v Ar vol-name
Volume identifier, max 127 ascii or 63 unicode chars, default: "Untitled UDF Volume"
.It Fl -enc Ar encoding-name
The character encoding of the volume name, can be "utf8" or "utf16", default: utf8
.Pp
.El
Virtual partitions (for CD-R, DVD-R SL/DL, DVD+R SL/DL, and HD DVD-R SL/DL):
.Bl -tag -width indent
.Pp
.It Fl S Ar start-block-address
The start block address of the last session.  Newfs_udf will search for this value for optical media
.Pp
.El
Sparable partitions (for CD-RW, DVD-RW, and DVD+RW):
.Bl -tag -width indent
.Pp
.It Fl -spare-blks Ar n
Total number of sparing blocks (2 sparing tables are always used), default: 128
.It Fl D Ar defect-file-name
The name of the file containing all defect blocks.  This file is a text file, contains the physical block address of the
media that has defects.  When one block of a packet is defective, the whole packet is marked as defective.  The block
numbers in the file is delimited by space.  Multiple numbers can be on the same line. 
.Pp
.El
Metadata partitions (for BD-R with POW, BD-RE and other overwritable media with UDF 2.50 or higher ):
.Bl -tag -width indent
.Pp
.It Fl -dup-meta-part-file
Duplicate the content of the metadata file in the metadata mirror file, default: no
.It Fl -meta-part-alloc-unit Ar n
The allocation unit size of the metadata partition in number of blocks, default: max(32, eccSizeInBlks, packetSize)
.It Fl -meta-part-align-unit Ar n
The alignment unit size of the metadata partition in number of blocks, default: max(eccSizeInBlks, packetSize)
.It Fl -meta-part-init-size Ar n
The initial size of the metadata partition in number of blocks, default: 32
.It Fl -userid Ar uid
or
.It Fl U Ar uid
Use the specified
.Ar uid
(numeric value only) as the owner of the root directory.
.It Fl -groupid Ar gid
or
.It Fl G Ar gid
Use the specified
.Ar gid
(numeric value only) as the group of the root directory.
.El

.Xr newfs 8
.Sh BUGS
Unallocated space is not supported yet.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm newfs_udf
utility first appeared in Mac OS X Leopard (10.5.0).

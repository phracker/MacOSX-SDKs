.SH "SUMMARY"
 
.PP
\fBhtcacheclean\fR is used to keep the size of mod_cache_disk's storage within a given size limit, or limit on inodes in use\&. This tool can run either manually or in daemon mode\&. When running in daemon mode, it sleeps in the background and checks the cache directory at regular intervals for cached content to be removed\&. You can stop the daemon cleanly by sending it a TERM or INT signal\&. When run manually, a once off check of the cache directory is made for cached content to be removed\&. If one or more URLs are specified, each URL will be deleted from the cache, if present\&.
 

.SH "OPTIONS"
 
 
.TP
\fB-d\fIinterval\fR\fR
Daemonize and repeat cache cleaning every \fIinterval\fR minutes\&. This option is mutually exclusive with the \fB-D\fR, \fB-v\fR and \fB-r\fR options\&. To shutdown the daemon cleanly, just send it a \fBSIGTERM\fR or \fBSIGINT\fR\&.  
.TP
\fB-D\fR
Do a dry run and don't delete anything\&. This option is mutually exclusive with the \fB-d\fR option\&. When doing a dry run and deleting directories with \fB-t\fR, the inodes reported deleted in the stats cannot take into account the directories deleted, and will be marked as an estimate\&.  
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Be verbose and print statistics\&. This option is mutually exclusive with the \fB-d\fR option\&.  
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Clean thoroughly\&. This assumes that the Apache web server is not running (otherwise you may get garbage in the cache)\&. This option is mutually exclusive with the \fB-d\fR option and implies the \fB-t\fR option\&.  
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Be nice\&. This causes slower processing in favour of other processes\&. \fBhtcacheclean\fR will sleep from time to time so that (a) the disk IO will be delayed and (b) the kernel can schedule other processes in the meantime\&.  
.TP
\fB-t\fR
Delete all empty directories\&. By default only cache files are removed, however with some configurations the large number of directories created may require attention\&. If your configuration requires a very large number of directories, to the point that inode or file allocation table exhaustion may become an issue, use of this option is advised\&.  
.TP
\fB-p\fIpath\fR\fR
Specify \fIpath\fR as the root directory of the disk cache\&. This should be the same value as specified with the CacheRoot directive\&.  
.TP
\fB-P\fIpidfile\fR\fR
Specify \fIpidfile\fR as the name of the file to write the process ID to when daemonized\&.  
.TP
\fB-R\fIround\fR\fR
Specify \fIround\fR as the amount to round sizes up to, to compensate for disk block sizes\&. Set to the block size of the cache partition\&.  
.TP
\fB-l\fIlimit\fR\fR
Specify \fIlimit\fR as the total disk cache size limit\&. The value is expressed in bytes by default (or attaching \fBB\fR to the number)\&. Attach \fBK\fR for Kbytes, \fBM\fR for MBytes or \fBG\fR for Gbytes\&.  
.TP
\fB-L\fIlimit\fR\fR
Specify \fIlimit\fR as the total disk cache inode limit\&. \fBK\fR, \fBM\fR or \fBG\fR suffix can also be used\&.  
.TP
\fB-i\fR
Be intelligent and run only when there was a modification of the disk cache\&. This option is only possible together with the \fB-d\fR option\&.  
.TP
\fB-a\fR
List the URLs currently stored in the cache\&. Variants of the same URL will be listed once for each variant\&.  
.TP
\fB-A\fR
List the URLs currently stored in the cache, along with their attributes in the following order: url, header size, body size, status, entity version, date, expiry, request time, response time, body present, head request\&.  
 
.SH "DELETING A SPECIFIC URL"
 
.PP
If \fBhtcacheclean\fR is passed one or more URLs, each URL will be deleted from the cache\&. If multiple variants of an URL exists, all variants would be deleted\&.
 
.PP
When a reverse proxied URL is to be deleted, the effective URL is constructed from the \fBHost\fR header, the \fBport\fR, the \fBpath\fR and the \fBquery\fR\&. Note the '?' in the URL must always be specified explicitly, whether a query string is present or not\&. For example, an attempt to delete the path \fB/\fR from the server \fBlocalhost\fR, the URL to delete would be \fBhttp://localhost:80/?\fR\&.
 
.SH "LISTING URLS IN THE CACHE"
 
.PP
By passing the \fB-a\fR or \fB-A\fR options to \fBhtcacheclean\fR, the URLs within the cache will be listed as they are found, one URL per line\&. The \fB-A\fR option dumps the full cache entry after the URL, with fields in the following order:
 
 
.TP
url
The URL of the entry\&. 
.TP
header size
The size of the header in bytes\&. 
.TP
body size
The size of the body in bytes\&. 
.TP
status
Status of the cached response\&. 
.TP
entity version
The number of times this entry has been revalidated without being deleted\&. 
.TP
date
Date of the response\&. 
.TP
expiry
Expiry date of the response\&. 
.TP
request time
Time of the start of the request\&. 
.TP
response time
Time of the end of the request\&. 
.TP
body present
If 0, no body is stored with this request, 1 otherwise\&. 
.TP
head request
If 1, the entry contains a cached HEAD request with no body, 0 otherwise\&. 
 
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
 
.PP
\fBhtcacheclean\fR returns a zero status ("true") if all operations were successful, \fB1\fR otherwise\&. If an URL is specified, and the URL was cached and successfully removed, \fB0\fR is returned, \fB2\fR otherwise\&. If an error occurred during URL removal, \fB1\fR is returned\&.

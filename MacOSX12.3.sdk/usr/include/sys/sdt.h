 * the header file ends up visible where software expects it to be.  We also
 * do the C/C++ symbol wrapping here, since Mach headers are technically C
 * interfaces.
 *
 * Note:  The process of adding USDT probes to code is slightly different
 * than documented in the "Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide".
 * The DTRACE_PROBE*() macros are not supported on Mac OS X -- instead see
 * "BUILDING CODE CONTAINING USDT PROBES" in the dtrace(1) manpage

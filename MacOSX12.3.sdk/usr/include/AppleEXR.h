/*  ************************************************
 *  ***  SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME -- Please Read  ***
 *  ************************************************
 *
 *  This is the low level API to a software OpenEXR encoder / decoder,
 *  intended to support the subset of operations needed by ImageIO in a
 *  lightweight, secure and performant manner. The same code is also usable
 *  through the higher level ImageIO.framework CGImageSource / CGImageDestination
 *  APIs and more generally through CGImageRef and associated AppKit / UIKit
 *  NSImage/UIImage interfaces. In most cases, those interfaces will prove
 *  simpler to use. This low level API is provided for those applications that
 *  need more direct access to the unique feature set of the OpenEXR file format
 *  that might otherwise be obscured by more general APIs that must service
 *  numerous other compressed image formats. If there is sufficient in interest,
 *  the feature set may be expanded in the future.
 *
 *  While this library attempts to be file format compatible with the ILM / Academy
 *  Software Foundation OpenEXR implementation (www.openexr.com), it is not API
 *  compatible with that work. Software written to use those interfaces will need to
 *  be modified in order to use these interfaces instead. No effort has been made to
 *  ensure that all operations in other OpenEXR implementations have a counterpart here.
 *
 *  Except for the _rgba interfaces, AppleEXR does not provide pixel type conversion services.
 *  Image data is provided as stored (after decompression) at the same precision found in the
 *  file. Most OpenEXR content is HDR linear gamma and care must be exercised when converting
 *  to other formats, especially traditional unorm based formats. Please see
 *  vImageConvert_AnyToAny() or MPSImageConversion.
 *
 *  Feature requests and bug reports may be made through to the ImageIO Radar component.
 *  See https://feedbackassistant.apple.com.

 *
 *
 *  Conceptual organization of files:
 *      The hierarchy of subdivision of a EXR file, is as follows:  EXR file > part > layer > channel > level
 *      At each level, there is a many to one relationship with the level before it. Each file may have many parts. Each
 *      part may have many layers. Each layer may have many channels, etc. A rough description of what each is follows:
 *
 *          EXR file:   A serialized file container that starts with little endian int32_t 20000630
 *          part:       A set of layers with shared metadata like a unified set of coordinates, color space,
 *                      and time stamp. Only channels in the same part can be decoded together.
 *                      Since generally all channels in a part must be at least partially decoded to read
 *                      any channel in the part, the part serves to provide some file segmentation
 *                      to reduce the amount of unnecessary work in files that contain a lot of data. Generally
 *                      only channels read together should appear in the same part. Except where adjusted by
 *                      a x- or y- downsampling rate (e.g. YCbCr 420), all channels in a part are the same height and width.
 *          layer:      A set of channels with the same name prefix, e.g. "camera1.R", "camera1.G", "camera1.B".  These
 *                      typically belong to the same conceptual data set, such as a RGB image shot from a particular
 *                      position in space. Do not mix unrelated data into the same layer.
 *          channel:    A sequence of float, uint32_t or half precision floating point values that encode a single
 *                      data channel in a file such as the alpha information for a layer. Channels may be anything,
 *                      and may include color channels, alpha channels, zbuffer channels, raw data, etc.
 *          level:      A channel may be available in a series of variants that have been down sampled by
 *                      a factor of a power of two. The full size image is available as level 0.  The downsampled
 *                      variants grow progressively smaller until the image is 1x1 in size.  Each such level is a rectangular
 *                      data plane belonging to a single channel.
 *
 *      Channels that have the same part and mip-/ripmap level can be read together as a interleaved (chunky) image,
 *      provided that their x/y downsampling rate is also the same. This is more efficient than reading data planes one at a time.
 *
 *  C++ sample code for quickly obtaining RGBA images with AppleEXR:
 *
 *      void * fileData = ...;  // pointer to contents of an EXR file in memory
 *      size_t fileSize = ...;  // number of bytes in the file
 *      axr_error_t axrErr = axr_error_success;
 *
 *      // create a axr_data_t to represent the file. See also axr_introspect_data()
 *      axr_data_t axrData = axr_data_create( fileData, fileSize, &axrErr); 
 *      if( NULL == axrData )
 *          return axrErr;
 *
 *      // Make a decoder for the part of the file you want to read
 *      //    default parameters will read the default layer from the first part
 *      axr_decoder_t d = axr_decoder_create_rgba(axrData);
 *      if( NULL == d )
 *      {
 *          os_release(axrData);
 *          return axr_error_insufficient_memory;
 *      }
 *
 *      // Figure out how big to make the buffer to receive the pixels
 *      axr_type_t sampleType = axr_decoder_get_channel_info(d, 0).sampleType;
 *      uint32_t channelSize = (uint32_t) axr_type_get_size(sampleType);
 *      uint32_t pixelSize = 4 * channelSize;       // RGBA = 4 channels
 *      axr_decoder_info_t info = axr_decoder_get_info(d);
 *      size_t rowBytes = info.subregion.size.width * pixelSize;
 *      void * buf = malloc( info.subregion.size.height * rowBytes );
 *             // ...handle malloc failure ...
 *
 *      // read the desired content from the file into buf as RGBA pixels
 *      if( axr_error_success == (axrErr = axr_decoder_read_rgba_pixels( d, buf, rowBytes )))
 *      {
 *          // Do something with the pixels here
 *      }
 *
 *      // Clean up. Note that if Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is on,
 *      // this part isn't necessary
 *      os_release(d);
 *      os_release(axrData);
 *
 *      free(buf);      // ARC doesn't clean this up
 *
 *      return axrErr;

 *              Skip Parameter Checking
 *                  Some methods may do extensive parameter checking. If this is a performance problem, you may try axr_flags_skip_parameter_checking
 *                  to disable this activity.  Note that as a consequence, the library may not catch or report usage that leads to undefined behavior and
 *                  undefined behavior will be the result in such cases.
 *
 *              Print Debug Info:
 *                  if something goes wrong, or there is something that AppleEXR wants to nag you about, human readable text will be
 *                  sent to the Apple System Logger to help explain the problem when axr_flags_print_debug_info is on. These messages
 *                  should show up on your debugger console. See also behavior of _AXR_DEFAULT_FLAGS for C++ automatic parameters.
 *                  Defining AXR_PRINT_DEBUG_INFO in the environment is another way to turn this on.

 *              Disable multithreading:
 *                 By default, expensive routines such as axr_decoder_read_pixels and axr_decoder_read_planes are likely to
 *                 use separate threads to read tiles from the EXR image so as to better take advantage of multiple processors on
 *                 your system.  If your application is reading multiple EXR files in parallel or otherwise is likely to be executing
 *                 multithreaded workloads at the time, it may not be advantageous for AppleEXR to spawn yet more GCD tasks to
 *                 do its work, since the machine is already saturated. It would just add unnecessary synchronization overhead and
 *                 pollute more of the caches.  In such cases, you may pass axr_flags_disable_multithreading to force serial operation
 *                 on the calling thread.
 *
 *              Disable automatic line order handling:
 *                 OpenEXR -- "When a scan-line based image is written, application code must set the lineOrder attribute in the header to INCREASING_Y
 *                           order (top scan line first) or DECREASING_Y order (bottom scan line first). Application code must then write the scan lines
 *                           in the specified order"   https://www.openexr.com/documentation/TechnicalIntroduction.pdf
 *
 *                 We interpret this to mean that if DECREASING_Y line order is set, you are responsible for vertically flipping the image yourself when reading
 *                 or writing the image when using ILM OpenEXR. AppleEXR, however, will by default attempt to automatically flip the image for you when it
 *                 detects axr_line_order_decreasing_y.    While better for users, this approach might be undesired if we misunderstand the situation, encounter
 *                 malformed images, or your application, having recently been ported from ILM OpenEXR, is not expecting this behavior.  Your application
 *                 may use axr_flags_disable_automatic_line_order_handling to cause the scanlines to be read or written in the order they appear in the file.
 *                 AppleEXR will still attempt to reorder tiles in the case that the order is axr_line_order_random_y.
 *
 *                 In the event your application needs to reverse the order of scanlines itself, this is most easily done by changing the pointer to your pixel buffer to point
 *                 to the bottom left corner of the region of interest that you wish to read/write, and negate the rowBytes parameter.  For example, when working
 *                 with axr_decoder_read_planes, you can adjust each plane as follows:
 *
 *                  // defeat C operator+ increment by sizeof(ptr[0]).  Increment by byte instead.  Defeat asan assertion for pointer overflow.
 *                  #define  ADVANCE_PTR( _ptr, _bytes )   ((__typeof__(_ptr)) (((uintptr_t) (_ptr)) + (_bytes)) )
 *
 *                  if( axr_part_info_t.lineOrder == axr_line_order_decreasing_y)
 *                  {
 *                      // move data to point to bottom left of image instead
 *                      axr_pixel_data_t.data = ADVANCE_PTR( axr_pixel_data_t.data,  (roiHeight - 1) * axr_pixel_data_t.rowBytes);      // roiHeight: see axr_decoder_set_subregion(... ySize). For entire image, see axr_data_get_level_size().height.
 *
 *                      //walk bottom to top through image
 *                      axr_pixel_data_t.rowBytes = -axr_pixel_data_t.rowBytes

/*! @struct axr_layer_info_t
    @abstract information about a EXR image layer
    @discussion  Especially in EXR v1 files (before multipart files were introduced) it may be common to have
                 dozens of channels in a part. While it is possible that these all encode different
                 types of data channel for the same part, it may also be that the multiplicity of channels
                 encodes a series of sub-images packaged together in the same file. For example, for a stereo
                 view image, there may be a left eye view and a right eye view. By convention these channels
                 might have names like:
 
                    "left.R", "left.G", "left.B"
                    "right.R", "right.G", "right.B"
 
                 The EXR layer abstraction groups these into "left" and "right" image layers, each with a red, green
                 and blue channel.
 
                 Why do we need layers if we we already have parts?  Version 1 of the file format did not
                 allow for multipart files. These files will be reported with a part count of 1. If multiple images
                 needed to be put in the same file, then one would have to use layers to describe how to
                 group the channels. A problem with this approach is that for most compression formats,
                 (not B44) it may be necessary to fully decode all of the channels in the file in order to get the
                 subset you are asking for in the image layer. When the file is a multipart file, then each part
                 has its own table of tile offsets and we only need to decode the part to get those channels
                 out.  It is possible that a version 2 file may also include layers within each part.

 *
 *              The object is a subclass of os_object and must be reference counted with os_retain / os_release

 *              to the decoder.
 *
 *              For the purpose of reading pixels from an axr_data_t, each axr_decoder_t is internally multithreaded on

 *              may be disabled using the axr_flags_disable_multithreading flag with axr_decoder_read_pixels/planes().
 *              To avoid redundant work, the threading granularity should align with and be a multiple of the
 *              axr_part_info_t.tileSize. Your application may create many axr_decoder_t objects for each axr_file_t.

/*! @function axr_decoder_append_channel

 *  @discussion Not atomic
 *          The correct choice of channel can sometimes be complicated by the presence of multiple
 *          views in the same part each with seemingly redundant color content. For example
 *          a part might reasonably contain 9 channels:
 *
 *              "red",         "green",        "blue",
 *              "left.red",   "left.green",  "left.blue",       // left stereo image
 *              "right.red", "right.green" "right.blue      // right stereo image
 *
 *          in any order. A simple heuristic such as pick the first few channels
 *          isn't likely to be robust.
 *
 *          In OpenEXR channel nomenclature, the channels are grouped into layers. Make sure
 *          that all channels that appear together in a part share the same layer. For the above set,
 *          the layers would be "", "left" and "right". Layers may themselves have multiple levels of
 *          hierarchy, such as "camera1.left.<channelname>" and do not need to share a consistent
 *          layer depth. As a general guideline for picking the default layer to show in the absence of
 *          other identifying information, prefer layers that have fewer prefixes over those with more.
 *          If two layers have the same number of prefixes, prefer the one that appears first in the file.
 *          Only channels in the same part may be read concurrently in the same call to
 *          axr_decoder_read_planes / axr_decoder_read_pixels. Layers with the same name in

/*! @abstract  interleave two or four channels from a subregion of an part into a single buffer
 *  @discussion Each pixel is a interleaved set of channels, e.g. RGBA, RGBA, RGBA...
 *              The channels must all be the same size. The number of channels must be 1, 2, or 4
 *              The x & y subsampling for the channels must match. The mip/rip levels must match.
 *              The position and size of the region of interest in the part must match.
 *              This method should be  faster than reading out planes separately then interleaving them.
 *              This method is not suitable for mixed sampling rates like 422, 420, etc. though it may
 *              be used to create the {Cb,Cr,Cb,Cr...} plane in 420.
 *
 *              Performance Advisory:  Most OpenEXR compression formats are best described as a
 *              2-pass decode process. Typically, the first pass decodes a lossless bitstream
 *              compression scheme like Zip or Huffman. The second pass extracts out the requested
 *              channels from the others, often performing some data manipulations along the way such
 *              as interleaving bytes from different points in the compressed stream, wavelet
 *              reconstruction or the B44 transform. Importantly, the first pass is generally very
 *              serial and not dynamically addressable due to variable code word size and lack of
 *              restart markers or other context clues. The second pass is typically very parallel, easily
 *              vectorizable and trivial to calculate the location of data leading to any particular pixel.
 *
 *              Because prior to 1st pass decompression the file contents are generally not dynamically addressable
 *              below part and chunk granularity, this library may have to do 1st pass decompression on much
 *              more data than is ultimately needed to fulfil the request. For this purpose, image subregions are
 *              rounded outward to the chunks (tiles) that contain them, and there is no dynamic addressability
 *              for channels at all. So, if one channel is needed from a part with 20 channels, the library might be
 *              forced to do 1st pass decoding on all 20 channels to retrieve the one requested.  Since the first pass
 *              may dominate the total decompression time -- recall this stage is also usually not vectorizable or
 *              trivially multithreaded -- and may have to work on much more data than is needed and AppleEXR
 *              does not currently cache the first pass decoding results for use by later calls to axr_decoder_read_planes
 *              or axr_decoder_read_pixels -- they are big -- it is important that your application acts to minimize the 1st
 *              pass workload. An application that does not take this file format limitation into consideration may find
 *              itself redundantly running 1st pass decompression on the same data over and over, triggering a needless
 *              performance regression of possibly an order of magnitude or more.
 *
 *              There are several things your application can do to mitigate this problem:
 *
 *              1) When possible, encode your images taking advantage of OpenEXR multipart (OpenEXR 2.0
 *              and later) file format, taking care to bundle channels that are used together into the same part.
 *              Move channels that are not used together or are rarely used off to other parts. This is most
 *              important when there are many channels in the part, only some of which are typically used.
 *
 *              2) If your application needs to read multiple channels from a part, be sure to read them all at once
 *              with a single call to axr_decoder_read_pixels or axr_decoder_read_planes. This will ensure the
 *              1st pass decoding stage happens only once per part.
 *
 *              3) The axr_compression_none and axr_compression_b44 methods do not involve a 1st pass
 *              and consequently do not suffer this limitation. axr_compression_b44a has a variable
 *              block encoding size and does not enjoy the same benefit as axr_compression_b44.
 * *
 *              Terms: An OpenEXR "part" is a OpenEXR file segment containing one or more channels. Prior to
 *              OpenEXR 2.0, all files were single part files, meaning that all channels were encoded together.
 *              Please see the OpenEXR File Layout specification for a more details. The number of parts returned by
 *              axr_data_get_part_count() is the number of parts in the file. Chunks are spatial subregions
 *              of each part. They are described as tiles in the AppleEXR interface. See axr_part_info_t.tileSize.
 *

 *              inefficient to read.  Consider making a file with just a few channels per part and many parts.
 *              Channels that are read together must be stored together in the same part and should

 *                       The ordering of the channels should match the ordering of the channels in the interleaved pixel buffer in memory.

 *                        given by the channelList parameter. Channel names are required for  axr_channel_type_unknown channels.
 *  @param   channelCount  The number of channels to be added together. Must be 1, 2, or 4
 *  @param   readFunc        This is called to get the next N bytes of the input source.  It should be a 1, 2, or 4 channel interleaved image with

 *  @discussion  if no seekProc is provided, AppleEXR will have to compress the entire file before any of it can be written.  This will
 *               result in much, much more memory usage.
 *
 *               Each tile EXR file contains all planes of the part. As AppleEXR encodes the tile, it will read a tile row sized
 *               chunk of pixels from each of your layer data providers in turn. This will cause all of your layer data providers
 *               to be open concurrently. They should attempt to minimize the amount of persistent storage they keep around
 *               between calls, if possible. 
 *
 *               *** Once axr_encoder_compress() returns, the object can not be reused. It should be released. ***
 *               This is because the axr_user_data_destructor_ts have been called and your resources no longer available.
 *               Since the encoder consumes itself as part of the compression operation (releases your resources to save
 *               memory), it should not be called reentrantly. You may call it from multiple threads as long as care is taken
 *               to protect the object with appropriate locks. While the object is likely to be internally multithreaded, calls to
 *               your applications storage object will be serialized.
 *
 *               Flags:
 *                  axr_flags_disable_multithreading â Pass this flag to force the compressor to run synchronously.
 *  @param encoder           A valid AppleEXR encoder
 *  @param storage           A pointer to your storage object.  AppleEXR doesn't know what this object is and will interact with it only through writeProc, seekProc, and destroyProc
 *  @param writeProc       A pointer to a function to write bytes to the storage
 *  @param seekProc         A optional pointer to a function to move the storage index around. If NULL, encoding will consume much more system memory.
 *  @param destroyProc  An optional pointer to a function to destroy or release the storage object
 *  @param flags            Flags to control the operation of axr_encoder_compress
 *  @return  On success, axr_error_success.  Otherwise, an error code is returned */

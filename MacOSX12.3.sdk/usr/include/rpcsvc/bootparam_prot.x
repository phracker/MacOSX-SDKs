/*
 * RPC for bootparms service.
 * There are two procedures:
 *   WHOAMI takes a net address and returns a client name and also a
 *	likely net address for routing
 *   GETFILE takes a client name and file identifier and returns the
 *	server name, server net address and pathname for the file.
 *   file identifiers typically include root, swap, pub and dump

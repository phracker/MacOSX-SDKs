    @class IOUSBHubDevice
    @abstract New in MAC OS X 10.5. The IOKit object representing a hub device on the USB bus. It is a subclass of IOUSBDevice.
    @discussion With the exception of the IOUSBRootHubDevice objects representing the root hubs, every IOUSBDevice
	will have an IOUSBHubDevice as its parent in the IOUSB plane. USB KEXT drivers will have the ability to 
	query this device for characteristics of the hub into which they are connected. This class will also give a dive driver
	the abilty to get an IOService* pointing to the hub driver itself, which can then be used as the parent in the power plane.

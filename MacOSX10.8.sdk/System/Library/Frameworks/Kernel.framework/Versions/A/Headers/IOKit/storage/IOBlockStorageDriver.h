 * @class IOBlockStorageDriver
 * @abstract
 * The common base class for generic block storage drivers.
 * @discussion
 * The IOBlockStorageDriver class is the common base class for generic block
 * storage drivers.  It matches and communicates via an IOBlockStorageDevice
 * interface, and connects to the remainder of the storage framework via the
 * IOStorage protocol. It extends the IOStorage protocol by implementing the
 * appropriate open and close semantics, deblocking for unaligned transfers,
 * polling for ejectable media, locking and ejection policies, media object
 * creation and tear-down, and statistics gathering and reporting.
 *
 * Block storage drivers are split into two parts: the generic driver handles
 * all generic device issues, independent of the lower-level transport
 * mechanism (e.g. SCSI, ATA, USB, FireWire). All storage operations
 * at the generic driver level are translated into a series of generic
 * device operations. These operations are passed via the IOBlockStorageDevice
 * nub to a transport driver, which implements the appropriate
 * transport-dependent protocol to execute these operations.
 *
 * To determine the write-protect state of a device (or media), for
 * example, the generic driver would issue a call to the
 * Transport Driver's reportWriteProtection method. If this were a SCSI
 * device, its transport driver would issue a Mode Sense command to
 * extract the write-protection status bit. The transport driver then
 * reports true or false to the generic driver.
 * 
 * The generic driver therefore has no knowledge of, or involvement
 * with, the actual commands and mechanisms used to communicate with
 * the device. It is expected that the generic driver will rarely, if
 * ever, need to be subclassed to handle device idiosyncrasies; rather,
 * the transport driver should be changed via overrides.
 * 
 * A generic driver could be subclassed to create a different type of
 * generic device. The generic driver IOCDBlockStorageDriver class is
 * a subclass of IOBlockStorageDriver, adding CD functions.

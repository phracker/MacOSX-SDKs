	@enum		CTParagraphStyleSpecifier
	@abstract	These constants are used to query and modify the CTParagraphStyle
				object.

	@discussion Each specifier has a type and a default value associated with it.
				The type must always be observed when setting or fetching the
				value from the CTParagraphStyle object. In addition, some
				specifiers affect the behavior of both the framesetter and
				the typesetter, and others only affect the behavior of the
				framesetter; this is also noted below.

	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierAlignment
				The text alignment. Natural text alignment is realized as
				left or right alignment, depending on the line sweep direction
				of the first script contained in the paragraph.

				Type: CTTextAlignment
				Default: kCTNaturalTextAlignment
				Application: CTFramesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierFirstLineHeadIndent
				The distance in points from the leading margin of a frame to
				the beginning of the paragraph's first line. This value is always
				nonnegative.

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierHeadIndent
				The distance in points from the leading margin of a text
				container to the beginning of lines other than the first.
				This value is always nonnegative.

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierTailIndent
				The distance in points from the margin of a frame to the end of
				lines. If positive, this value is the distance from the leading
				margin (for example, the left margin in left-to-right text).
				If 0 or negative, it's the distance from the trailing margin.

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierTabStops
				The CTTextTab objects, sorted by location, that define the tab
				stops for the paragraph style.

				Type: CFArray of CTTextTabRef
				Default: 12 left-aligned tabs, spaced by 28.0 points
				Application: CTFramesetter, CTTypesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierDefaultTabInterval
				The document-wide default tab interval. Tabs after the last
				specified by kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierTabStops are placed at
				integer multiples of this distance (if positive).

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter, CTTypesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineBreakMode
				The mode that should be used to break lines when laying out
				the paragraph's text.

				Type: CTLineBreakMode
				Default: kCTLineBreakByWordWrapping
				Application: CTFramesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineHeightMultiple
				The line height multiple. The natural line height of the
				receiver is multiplied by this factor (if positive) before
				being constrained by minimum and maximum line height.

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMaximumLineHeight
				The maximum height that any line in the frame will occupy,
				regardless of the font size or size of any attached graphic.
				Glyphs and graphics exceeding this height will overlap
				neighboring lines. A maximum height of 0 implies
				no line height limit. This value is always nonnegative.

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMinimumLineHeight
				The minimum height that any line in the frame will occupy,
				regardless of the font size or size of any attached graphic.
				This value is always nonnegative.

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineSpacing
				Deprecated.
				Use kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMaximumLineSpacing, kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMinimumLineSpacing,
				and kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineSpaceAdjustment to control
				space between lines.
				


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierParagraphSpacing
				The space added at the end of the paragraph to separate it from
				the following paragraph. This value is always nonnegative and is
				determined by adding the previous paragraph's
				kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierParagraphSpacing setting and the
				current paragraph's kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierParagraphSpacingBefore
				setting.

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierParagraphSpacingBefore
				The distance between the paragraph's top and the beginning of
				its text content.

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter


	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierBaseWritingDirection
				The base writing direction of the lines.

				Type: CTWritingDirection
				Default: kCTWritingDirectionNatural
				Application: CTFramesetter, CTTypesetter

	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMaximumLineSpacing
				The maximum space in points between lines within the paragraph
				(commonly known as leading). This value is always
				nonnegative.

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: some large number.
				Application: CTFramesetter
 
	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMinimumLineSpacing
				The minimum space in points between lines within the paragraph
				(commonly known as leading). This value is always
				nonnegative.

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter
 
	@constant	kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineSpaceAdjustment
				The space in points added between lines within the paragraph
				(commonly known as leading). 

				Type: CGFloat
				Default: 0.0
				Application: CTFramesetter

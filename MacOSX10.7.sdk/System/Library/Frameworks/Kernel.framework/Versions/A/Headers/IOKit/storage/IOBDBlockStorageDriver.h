 * @class
 * IOBDBlockStorageDriver
 * @abstract
 * Generic BD Driver.
 * @discussion
 * Storage drivers are split into two parts: the Generic Driver handles
 * all generic device issues, independent of the lower-level transport
 * mechanism (e.g. SCSI, ATA, USB, FireWire). All storage operations
 * at the Generic Driver level are translated into a series of generic
 * device operations. These operations are passed via the Device Nub
 * to a Transport Driver, which implements the appropriate
 * transport-dependent protocol to execute these operations.
 * 
 * To determine the write-protect state of a device (or media), for
 * example, the generic driver would issue a call to the
 * Transport Driver's reportWriteProtection method. If this were a SCSI
 * device, its Transport Driver would issue a Mode Sense command to
 * extract the write-protection status bit. The Transport Driver then
 * reports true or false to the generic driver.
 * 
 * The generic driver therefore has no knowledge of, or involvement
 * with, the actual commands and mechanisms used to communicate with
 * the device. It is expected that the generic driver will rarely, if
 * ever, need to be subclassed to handle device idiosyncrasies; rather,
 * the Transport Driver should be changed via overrides.
 * 
 * A generic driver could be subclassed to create a different type of
 * generic device. The generic driver IOBDBlockStorageDriver class is a subclass
 * of IODVDBlockStorageDriver, adding BD functions. Similarly, the Transport Driver
 * IOBDBlockStorageDevice is a subclass of IODVDBlockStorageDevice, adding BD 
 * functions.

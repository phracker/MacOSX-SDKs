@typedef FFCONDITION
 @abstract Contains type-specific information for the following effects.
<ul>
	<li>SPRING</li>
	<li>DAMPER</li>
	<li>INERTIA</li>
	<li>FRICTION</li>
</ul>
 @discussion A pointer to an array of FFCONDITION structures for an effect is passed in the <b>lpvTypeSpecificParams</b> member of the FFEFFECT structure. The number of elements in the array must be either one, or equal to the number of axes associated with the effect.
 <br>
 <br>
 Different types of conditions interpret the parameters differently, but the basic idea is that force resulting from a condition is equal to <i>A(q - q0)</i> where <i>A</i> is a scaling coefficient, <i>q</i> is some metric, and <i>q0</i> is the neutral value for that metric.
 <br>
 <br>
 The preceding simplified formula must be adjusted if a nonzero deadband is provided. If the metric is less than <b>lOffset - lDeadBand</b>, the resulting force is given by the following formula:<br>
 <br><i>force</i> = <b>lNegativeCoefficient</b> * (<i>q</i> - (<b>lOffset - lDeadBand</b>))
 <br>
 <br>
 Similarly, if the metric is greater than <b>lOffset + lDeadBand</b>, the resulting force is given by the following formula:
 <br>
 <br>
 <i>force</i> = <b>lPositiveCoefficient</b> * (<i>q</i> - (<b>lOffset + lDeadBand</b>))
 <br>
 <br>
 A spring condition uses axis position as the metric.
 <br>
 <br>
 A damper condition uses axis velocity as the metric.
 <br>
 <br>
 An inertia condition uses axis acceleration as the metric.
 <br>
 <br>
 If the number of FFCONDITION structures in the array is equal to the number of axes for the effect, the first structure applies to the first axis, the second applies to the second axis, and so on. For example, a two-axis spring condition with <b>lOffset</b> set to 0 in both FFCONDITION structures would have the same effect as the joystick self-centering spring. When a condition is defined for each axis in this way, the effect must not be rotated.
 <br>
 <br>
 If there is a single FFCONDITION structure for an effect with more than one axis, the direction along which the parameters of the FFCONDITION structure are in effect is determined by the direction parameters passed in the <b>rglDirection</b> field of the FFEFFECT structure. For example, a friction condition rotated 45 degrees (in polar coordinates) would resist joystick motion in the northeast-southwest direction but would have no effect on joystick motion in the northwest-southeast direction.
 @field lOffset Offset for the condition, in the range from -10,000 through 10,000.
 @field lPositiveCoefficient Coefficient constant on the positive side of the offset, in the range from -10,000 through 10,000.
 @field lNegativeCoefficient Coefficient constant on the negative side of the offset, in the range from -10,000 through 10,000.
 <br>
 <br>
 If the device does not support separate positive and negative coefficients, the value of <b>lNegativeCoefficient</b> is ignored, and the value of <b>lPositiveCoefficient</b> is used as both the positive and negative coefficients. 
 @field dwPositiveSaturation Maximum force output on the positive side of the offset, in the range from 0 through 10,000.
 <br>
 <br>
 If the device does not support force saturations, the value of this member is ignored.
 @field dwNegativeSaturation Maximum force output on the negative side of the offset, in the range from 0 through 10,000.
 <br>
 <br>
 If the device does not support force saturation, the value of this member is ignored.
 <br>
 <br>
 If the device does not support separate positive and negative saturation, the value of <b>dwNegativeSaturation</b> is ignored, and the value of <b>dwPositiveSaturation</b> is used as both the positive and negative saturation.
 @field lDeadBand Region around <b>lOffset</b> in which the condition is not active, in the range from 0 through 10,000. In other words, the condition is not active between <b>lOffset</b> minus <b>lDeadBand</b> and <b>lOffset</b> plus <b>lDeadBand</b>.

@typedef FFEFFECT
 @abstract UsUsed by the FFDeviceCreateEffect method to initialize a new effect object. It is also used by the FFEffectSetParameters and FFEffectGetParameters functions.
 @discussion OBJECT IDS cannot be used to identify trigger buttons in <b>dwTriggerButton</b>, and output axes in <b>rgdwAxes[<i>n</i>]</b>. Please use object offsets (FFJOFS_* constants), the only supported method.
 @field dwSize Size, in bytes, of this structure. This member must be initialized before the structure is used. 
 @field dwFlags Flags associated with the effect. This value can be a combination of one or more of the following values:
<ul>
	<li>FFEFF_CARTESIAN </li>
</ul>
The values of <b>rglDirection</b> are to be interpreted as Cartesian coordinates. 
<ul>
	<li>FFEFF_OBJECTOFFSETS </li>
</ul>
The values of <b>dwTriggerButton</b> and <b>rgdwAxes</b> are data format offsets, FFJOFS_* constants.  This flag is not necessary, as the format is assumed.  The OBJECTIDS method of specifying <b>dwTriggerButton</b> and <b>rgdwAxes</b> is not supported -- FFJOFS_* constants MUST be used.
<ul>
	<li>FFEFF_POLAR </li>
</ul>
The values of <b>rglDirection</b> are to be interpreted as polar coordinates. 
<ul>
	<li>FFEFF_SPHERICAL </li>
</ul>
The values of <b>rglDirection</b> are to be interpreted as spherical coordinates. 
 @field dwDuration The total duration of the effect, in microseconds. If this value is FF_INFINITE, the effect has infinite duration. If an envelope has been applied to the effect, the attack is applied, followed by an infinite sustain.  
 @field dwSamplePeriod The period at which the device should play back the effect, in microseconds. A value of 0 indicates that the default playback sample rate should be used. 
<br>
<br>
If the device is not capable of playing back the effect at the specified rate, it chooses the supported rate that is closest to the requested value. 
<br>
<br>
Setting a custom <b>dwSamplePeriod</b> can be used for special effects. For example, playing a sine wave at an artificially large sample period results in a rougher texture. 
 @field dwGain The gain to be applied to the effect, in the range from 0 through 10,000. The gain is a scaling factor applied to all magnitudes of the effect and its envelope. 
 @field dwTriggerButton The identifier or offset of the button to be used to trigger playback of the effect. The FFJOFS_* flags must be used to specify the value. If this member is set to FFEB_NOTRIGGER, no trigger button is associated with the effect. 
 @field dwTriggerRepeatInterval The interval, in microseconds, between the end of one playback and the start of the next when the effect is triggered by a button press and the button is held down. Setting this value to FF_INFINITE suppresses repetition. 
 @field cAxes Number of axes involved in the effect. This member must be filled in by the caller if changing or setting the axis list or the direction list. 
<br>
<br>
The number of axes for an effect cannot be changed once it has been set. 
 @field rgdwAxes Pointer to a DWORD array (of <b>cAxes</b> elements) containing identifiers or offsets identifying the axes to which the effect is to be applied. The FFJOFS_* flags must be used to specify the values in the array. 
<br>
<br>
The list of axes associated with an effect cannot be changed once it has been set. 
<br>
<br>
No more than 32 axes can be associated with a single effect. 
 @field rglDirection Pointer to a LONG array (of <b>cAxes</b> elements) containing either Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates, or spherical coordinates. The flags FFEFF_CARTESIAN, FFEFF_POLAR, and FFEFF_SPHERICAL determine the semantics of the values in the array. 
<br>
<br>
If Cartesian, each value in <b>rglDirection</b> is associated with the corresponding axis in <b>rgdwAxes</b>. 
<br>
<br>
If polar, the angle is measured in hundredths of degrees from the (0, -1) direction, rotated in the direction of (1, 0). This usually means that north is away from the user, and east is to the user's right. The last element is not used. 
<br>
<br>
If spherical, the first angle is measured in hundredths of a degree from the (1, 0) direction, rotated in the direction of (0, 1). The second angle (if the number of axes is three or more) is measured in hundredths of a degree toward (0, 0, 1). The third angle (if the number of axes is four or more) is measured in hundredths of a degree toward (0, 0, 0, 1), and so on. The last element is not used. 
<br>
<br>
Note:  The <b>rglDirection</b> array must contain <b>cAxes</b> entries, even if polar or spherical coordinates are given. In these cases, the last element in the <b>rglDirection</b> array is reserved for future use and must be 0. 
 @field lpEnvelope Optional pointer to a FFENVELOPE structure that describes the envelope to be used by this effect. Not all effect types use envelopes. If no envelope is to be applied, the member should be set to NULL. 
 @field cbTypeSpecificParams Number of bytes of additional type-specific parameters for the corresponding effect type. 
 @field lpvTypeSpecificParams TPointer to type-specific parameters, or NULL if there are no type-specific parameters. 
<br>
<br>
If the effect is of type FFEFT_CONDITION, this member contains a pointer to an array of FFCONDITION structures that define the parameters for the condition. A single structure may be used, in which case the condition is applied in the direction specified in the <b>rglDirection</b> array. Otherwise, there must be one structure for each axis, in the same order as the axes in <b>rgdwAxes</b> array. If a structure is supplied for each axis, the effect should not be rotated; you should use the following values in the <b>rglDirection</b> array: 
<ul>
	<li>FFEFF_SPHERICAL: 0, 0, ... </li>
	<li>FFEFF_POLAR: 9000, 0, ... </li>
	<li>FFEFF_CARTESIAN: 1, 0, ... </li>
</ul>
If the effect is of type FFEFT_CUSTOMFORCE, this member contains a pointer to a FFCUSTOMFORCE structure that defines the parameters for the custom force. 
<br>
<br>
If the effect is of type FFEFT_PERIODIC, this member contains a pointer to a FFPERIODIC structure that defines the parameters for the effect. 
<br>
<br>
If the effect is of type FFEFT_CONSTANTFORCE, this member contains a pointer to a FFCONSTANTFORCE structure that defines the parameters for the constant force. 
<br>
<br>
If the effect is of type FFEFT_RAMPFORCE, this member contains a pointer to a FFRAMPFORCE structure that defines the parameters for the ramp force.

 <br>FFCAP_ST_KINESTHETIC
<br>A kinesthetic force feedback device is one that can produce "grounded" forces based on the controller's position.  It supports temporal force-feedback effects (periodic vibrations), as well as directional (constant force) and position-based (spring, damper) forces.  Most higher-end force-feedback joysticks and steering wheels fall into this category.
<br>
 <br>FFCAP_ST_VIBRATION
<br>A vibration force feedback device is one that can only produce non-grounded temporal force-feedback effects (periodic vibrations).  Most console gamepads and some lower-end joysticks fall into this category.
<br>
 <br>The force-feedback subtype must be provided, and can only be one of the aforementioned values.
@field numFfAxes The number of controller axes that provide force feedback.  Indicates the number of valid elements in ffAxes.
@field ffAxes An array of values that decribe the axes on which force-feedback is present.  The number of valid elements in the array is specified in numFfAxes.  Each element of the array can contain one of the following values:
<br>
 <br>FFJOFS_X
<br>The X-axis is force-feedback-actuated.

 <br>FFJOFS_Y
<br>The Y-axis is force-feedback-actuated.
<br>
 <br>FFJOFS_Z

 <br>For devices of subType FFCAP_ST_VIBRATION, it is recommended that the numFfAxes = 1, and that ffAxes[0] = FFJOFS_X.
@field storageCapacity
The maximum number of effects that can be created via calls to FFDeviceCreateEffect and coexist at any one time.  This may or may not be different from the playbackCapacity, depending on device driver complexity.

The maximum number of created effects that can be simultaneously played via calls to FFEffectStart.  This number will always be equal to or less than the storageCapacity.  A device driver may allow more effects to be created than the physical device can actually handle.  Therefore, this number is an important parameter for FF designers.

<br>	FFGFFS_POWERON 
<br>	Power to the force feedback system is currently available. If the device cannot report the power state, neither FFGFFS_POWERON nor FFGFFS_POWEROFF is returned. 
<br>
<br>	FFGFFS_SAFETYSWITCHOFF

	@param		flags		Single value indicating the desired change in state. The value can be one of the following: 
<br>
<br>	FFSFFC_CONTINUE 
<br>	Paused playback of all active effects is to be continued. It is an error to send this command when the device is not in a paused state. 
<br>
<br>	FFSFFC_PAUSE 
<br>	Playback of all active effects is to be paused. This command also stops the clock-on effects so that they continue playing to their full duration when restarted. 
<br>
<br>	While the device is paused, new effects cannot be started, and existing ones cannot be modified. Doing so can cause the subsequent FFSFFC_CONTINUE command to fail to perform properly. 
<br>
<br>	To abandon a pause and stop all effects, use the FFSFFC_STOPALL or FFSFCC_RESET commands. 
<br>
<br>	FFSFFC_RESET 
<br>	The device's force feedback system is to be put in its startup state. All effects are removed from the device, are no longer valid, and must be recreated if they are to be used again. The device's actuators are disabled. 
<br>
<br>	FFSFFC_SETACTUATORSOFF 
<br>	The device's force feedback actuators are to be disabled. While the actuators are off, effects continue to play but are ignored by the device. Using the analogy of a sound playback device, they are muted, rather than paused. 
<br>
<br>	FFSFFC_SETACTUATORSON 
<br>	The device's force feedback actuators are to be enabled. 
<br>
<br>	FFSFFC_STOPALL 
<br>	Playback of any active effects is to be stopped. All active effects are reset, but are still being maintained by the device and are still valid. If the device is in a paused state, that state is lost.

<br>	0 - OFF: The device should not automatically center when the user releases the device. An application that uses force feedback should disable autocentering before playing effects. 
<br>	1 - ON: The device should automatically center when the user releases the device.
<br>	Not all devices support the autocenter property. 
<br>
<br>	FFPROP_FFGAIN 
<br>	Sets the gain for the device.
<br>	The pValue member points to a UInt32 that contains a gain value that is applied to all effects created on the device. The value is an integer in the range from 0 through 10,000, specifying the amount by which effect magnitudes should be scaled for the device. For example, a value of 10,000 indicates that all effect magnitudes are to be taken at face value. A value of 9,000 indicates that all effect magnitudes are to be reduced to 90% of their nominal magnitudes.

<br>	FFEP_AXES 
<br>	The cAxes and rgdwAxes members should receive data. The cAxes member on entry contains the size (in DWORDs) of the buffer pointed to by the rgdwAxes member. If the buffer is too small, the method returns FFERR_MOREDATA and sets cAxes to the necessary size of the buffer.

<br>	The dwFlags member must include at least one of the coordinate system flags (FFEFF_CARTESIAN, FFEFF_POLAR, or FFEFF_SPHERICAL). The API returns the direction of the effect in one of the coordinate systems you specified, converting between coordinate systems as necessary.

<br>
	@discussion	The FFEffectSetParameters method automatically downloads the effect, but this behavior can be suppressed by setting the FFEP_NODOWNLOAD flag. If automatic download has been suppressed, you can manually download the effect by invoking the FFEffectDownload method.
<br>
<br>	If the effect is playing while the parameters are changed, the new parameters take effect as if they were the parameters when the effect started.
<br>
<br>	For example, suppose a periodic effect with a duration of three seconds is started. After two seconds, the direction of the effect is changed. The effect then continues for one additional second in the new direction. The envelope, phase, amplitude, and other parameters of the effect continue smoothly, as if the direction had not changed.
<br>
<br>	In the same situation, if after two seconds the duration of the effect were changed to 1.5 seconds, the effect would stop.
<br>
<br>	Normally, if the driver cannot update the parameters of a playing effect, the driver is permitted to stop the effect, update the parameters, and then restart the effect. Passing the FFEP_NORESTART flag suppresses this behavior. If the driver cannot update the parameters of an effect while it is playing, the error code FFERR_EFFECTPLAYING is returned, and the parameters are not updated.
<br>
<br>	No more than one of the FFEP_NODOWNLOAD, FFEP_START, and FFEP_NORESTART flags should be set. (It is also valid to pass none of them.)
<br>
<br>	These three flags control download and playback behavior as follows:
<br>
<br>	If FFEP_NODOWNLOAD is set, the effect parameters are updated but not downloaded to the device.
<br>
<br>	If the FFEP_START flag is set, the effect parameters are updated and downloaded to the device, and the effect is started just as if the FFEffect_Start method had been called with the dwIterations parameter set to 1 and with no flags. (Combining the update with FFEP_START is slightly faster than calling Start separately, because it requires less information to be transmitted to the device.)
<br>
<br>	If neither FFEP_NODOWNLOAD nor FFEP_START is set and the effect is not playing, the parameters are updated and downloaded to the device.
<br>
<br>	If neither FFEP_NODOWNLOAD nor FFEP_START is set and the effect is playing, the parameters are updated if the device supports on-the-fly updating. Otherwise the behavior depends on the state of the FFEP_NORESTART flag. If it is set, the error code FFERR_EFFECTPLAYING is returned. If it is clear, the effect is stopped, the parameters are updated, and the effect is restarted.

        @param		iterations		Number of times to play the effect in sequence. The envelope is re-articulated with each iteration. 
<br>
<br>	To play the effect exactly once, pass 1. To play the effect repeatedly until explicitly stopped, pass INFINITE. To play the effect until explicitly stopped without re-articulating the envelope, modify the effect parameters with the FFEffect_SetParameters method, and change the dwDuration member to INFINITE. 
        @param		flags			Flags that describe how the effect should be played by the device. The value can be 0 or one or more of the following values: 
<br>
<br>	FFES_SOLO 
<br>	All other effects on the device should be stopped before the specified effect is played. If this flag is omitted, the effect is mixed with existing effects already started on the device. 
<br>
<br>	FFES_NODOWNLOAD 
<br>	Do not automatically download the effect.  
	@result		If the method succeeds, the return value is FF_OK.  If the method fails, the return value can be one of the following error values:
<br>	
<br>	FFERR_INVALIDPARAM
<br>	FFERR_DEVICEPAUSED
<br>	FFERR_DEVICEFULL
<br>	FFERR_INVALIDDOWNLOADID
<br>	FFERR_INTERNAL
<br>	FFERR_EFFECTTYPEMISMATCH
<br>	FFERR_GENERIC
<br>
	@discussion	Not all devices support multiple iterations.

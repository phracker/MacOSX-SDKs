.Nd FileVault configuration tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar verb
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to enable or disable FileVault, to list, add, or remove enabled FileVault users, and to obtain status about the current state of FileVault. Most commands require root access and need to be authenticated with either a FileVault password, a personal recovery key (if enabled), and in some cases the private key from the installed institutional recovery key.  Some status related commands can be run from a non-root session.
.Pp
Certain commands allow you to authenticate and unlock by providing the
.Sy -key 
option followed by the path to a keychain file containing the private key of the installed institutional recovery key.  Do not include the certificate in this keychain.
.Pp
By default, when enabling FileVault
.Nm
will only return a personal recovery key. Given the proper certificate information, 
.Nm
can install an institutional recovery key.  You can also set it up without a personal recovery key using the
.Sy -norecoverykey
option, though this is not recommended unless you are also installing an institutional recovery key.   Either type of keys can be added or changed at a later time.
.Pp
With the
.Sy -keychain
option, an institutional recovery key can be set up by placing an X.509 asymmetric public certificate in the /Library/Keychains/FileVaultMaster.keychain file. \fBsecurity create-filevaultmaster-keychain\fP can be used to create the keychain. Alternatively a certificate can be passed in by using the
.Sy -certificate 
option and entering the path to the DER encoded certificate file. In this case the FileVaultMaster.keychain file will be created using the certificate. With your .cer file, the optional certificate data can be obtained using the base64 tool.  For example: 'base64 /path/to/mycert.cer > /mynewdata.txt', at which point you would copy the data string contained in the text file and place it into the Certificate <data></data> value area of the property list.
.Pp
Because the user password may not be immediately available, read the DEFERRED ENABLEMENT section below for information on how to delay enabling FileVault until the user logs in or out.
.Pp
The
.Sy status
command will indicate if FileVault is On or Off.  If a FileVault master keychain is installed into the /Library/Keychains folder it will also report this back.  Note that this, by itself, does not indicate whether or not FileVault has been set up with an institutional recovery key.  Use the
.Sy hasinstitutionalrecoverykey
command to see if the institutional recovery key is active.
.Pp
The
.Sy list
command will display the short names and UUIDs of enabled FileVault users. You can use the
.Sy -extended
option to display a full list of existing user types along with some additional information.  This information will include if the recovery key was escrowed, though note that it will show "Yes" even if the information has not yet been successfully sent to the server.  The
.Sy remove
command will remove a user from FileVault given either the user name or the FileVault UUID.
.Pp
The
.Sy sync
command synchronizes Open Directory attributes (e.g. user pictures) with appropriate FileVault users, and removes FileVault users that were removed from Open Directory.   In most cases these changes will already be updated in FileVault.
.Sy sync
does not add users to FileVault.
.Pp
Use the
.Sy haspersonalrecoverykey
or
.Sy hasinstitutionalrecoverykey
commands to see if FileVault has a personal or institutional recovery key set up.  If FileVault is active and the key is set, these commands will return "true", otherwise they will return "false".  Note that "false" may also be returned if any error occurs, or if FileVault is not yet fully enabled.
.Pp
If a user currently has the system unlocked using the recovery key, the
.Sy usingrecoverykey
command will return "true".
.Pp
The
.Sy changerecovery
command changes or adds either the personal or institutional recovery key.  You can only have one recovery key of each type, so any associated existing key will be removed.  The
.Sy removerecovery
command will remove any existing recovery key of the type specified.  It is not recommended that you remove all recovery keys since, if you lose your FileVault password, you may not be able to access your information.
.Pp
On supported hardware,
.Nm
allows restart of a FileVault-enabled system without requiring
unlock during the subsequent boot using the
.Sy authrestart
command. WARNING: FileVault protections
are reduced during authenticated restarts. In particular,
.Nm
deliberately stores at least one additional copy of a permanent FDE (full disk encryption)
unlock key in both system memory and (on supported systems) the
System Management Controller (SMC).
.Nm
must be run as root and itself prompts for a password to unlock the
FileVault root volume.  Use
.Sy pmset destroyfvkeyonstandby
to prevent saving the key across standby modes. Once 
.Sy authrestart
is authenticated, it launches
.Xr reboot 8
and, upon successful unlock, the unlock key will be removed.  You can also use this as an option to the
.Sy enable
command if the system supports this feature.  The
.Sy supportsauthrestart
command will check the system to see if it supports this option, however you should note that even if this returns true, FileVault must still be enabled for
.Sy authrestart
to work.

.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.Pp
.It Fl defer Ar file_path
Defer enabling FileVault until the user password is obtained, and recovery key and system information will be written to the file path.
.Pp
.It Fl user Ar user_shortname
Short user name.
.Pp
.It Fl uuid Ar user_uuid
User UUID in canonical form: 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555.
.Pp
.It Fl usertoadd Ar added_user
Additional user(s) to be added to FileVault.
.Pp
.It Fl inputplist
Acquire configuration information from stdin when enabling or adding users to FileVault.
.Pp
.It Fl prompt
Always prompt for information.
.Pp
.It Fl forcerestart
Force a normal restart after FileVault has been successfully configured.
.Pp
.It Fl authrestart
Do an authenticated restart after a successful enable occurs.
.Pp
.It Fl outputplist
Outputs the recovery key and additional system information to stdout in a plist dictionary.  If the recovery key changes, the dictionary will also contain a Change key and the EnableDate key will contain the date of the change.   Where possible, you should avoid writing this file to a persistent location since it may pose additional security risk, and at the very least, securely remove the file as soon as possible.
.Pp
.It Fl keychain
Use the institutional recovery key stored in /Library/Keychains/FileVaultMaster.keychain.
.Pp
.It Fl certificate Ar path_to_cer_file
Use the certificate data located at the path. Any existing /Library/Keychains/FileVaultMaster.keychain file will be moved away with the location logged in the system log.  Do not set this option if your certificate data is located in the input plist information.
.Pp
.It Fl key Ar path_to_keychain_file
Use the keychain file located at the path containing the private key for the currently installed institiutional recovery key to unlock and authenticate FileVault.
.Pp
.It Fl norecoverykey
Do not return a personal recovery key.
.Pp
.It Fl forceatlogin Ar max_cancel_attempts
When using the -defer option, prompt the designated user at login time to enable FileVault.  The user has at most
.Sy max_cancel_attempts
to cancel and bypass enabling FileVault before it will be required to log in.   If this value is 0, the user's next login will require that they enable FileVault before being allowed to use their account.   Other special values include -1 to ignore this option, and 9999, which means that the user should never be forced to enable FileVault (instead the user will just be prompted each time at login until FileVault is enabled).
.Pp
.It Fl dontaskatlogout
When using the -defer option, the default action will be to prompt the designated user at user logout time for their password in order to enable FileVault.  If this option is used, the logout enablement window is not shown.  The assumption is that you are instead using the -forceatlogin option to prompt at user login time to enable FileVault.
.Pp
.It Fl extended
Return extended output information for certain commands.  Currently only used for the list command.
.El
.Sh DEFERRED ENABLEMENT
.Pp
The
.Sy -defer
option can be used with the
.Sy enable
command option to delay enabling FileVault until after the current (or next) user logs in or out, thus avoiding the need to enter a password when the tool is run. Depending on the options set, the user will either be prompted at logout time for the password, or the user will be prompted to enable FileVault when they log in. If the volume is not already a CoreStorage volume, the system may need to be restarted to start the encryption process. Dialogs are automatically dismissed and canceled after 60 seconds if no interaction occurs.
.Pp
The
.Sy -defer
option sets up a single user to be added to FileVault. If there was no user specified (e.g. without the
.Sy -user
option), then the currently logged in user will be added to the configuration and becomes the designated user. If there is no user specified and no users are logged in at the time of configuration, then the next user that logs in will become the designated user.
.Pp
As recovery key information is not generated until the user password is obtained, the
.Sy -defer
option requires a path where this information will be written to. The property list file will be created as a root-only readable file and should be placed in a secure location.  You can use the
.Sy showdeferralinfo
command to view the current deferral configuration information.
.Pp
Options that can be used in conjunction with the
.Sy -defer
option include: 
.Sy -keychain,
.Sy -certificate,
.Sy -forcerestart,
.Sy -forceatlogin,
.Sy -dontaskatlogout,
.Sy -user,
and 
.Sy -norecoverykey.
.Pp
Note that if the designated user is being prompted at logout to enable FileVault, and doesn't complete the setup, FileVault will not be enabled, but the configuration will remain and be used again for the designated user's next logout (or login if the -forceatlogin option is enabled), thereby 'nagging' the user to enable FileVault.   When using the -forceatlogin option, the user is given a certain number of attempts to enable FileVault, in which they can cancel the operation and continue to use their system without FileVault.  When the number of cancel attempts is reached, the user will not be able to log into their account until FileVault is enabled.    The current value of the user's remaining attempts can be viewed using the
.Sy showdeferralinfo
command.   Special values for the -forceatlogin option include setting it to '0' to force the enablement immediately at next login, a '-1' disables the check entirely, and a special value of '9999' means that the user will never be required to enable FileVault.   If a personal recovery key is used, the user should probably be warned ahead of time that, upon successful enablement, they will need to write down and keep in a safe place the FileVault recovery key shown on the screen.
.Pp
To remove an active deferred enablement configuration, you can use the
.Sy disable
command, even if FileVault is not currently enabled.

Care should be taken with passwords that may be used within files.  For example, if you are scripting and need to securely remove a file, you should use 'srm' instead of 'rm'.  Other precautions should be taken in your scripts to try to pass plist data directly from one tool to another to avoid writing this information to a persistent location.

.SH "NAME"
perl5100delta \- what is new for perl 5.10.0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes the differences between the 5.8.8 release and
the 5.10.0 release.
.PP
Many of the bug fixes in 5.10.0 were already seen in the 5.8.X maintenance
releases; they are not duplicated here and are documented in the set of
man pages named perl58[1\-8]?delta.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.ie n .SS "The ""feature"" pragma"
.el .SS "The \f(CWfeature\fP pragma"
.IX Subsection "The feature pragma"
The \f(CW\*(C`feature\*(C'\fR pragma is used to enable new syntax that would break Perl's
backwards-compatibility with older releases of the language. It's a lexical
pragma, like \f(CW\*(C`strict\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Currently the following new features are available: \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR (adds a
switch statement), \f(CW\*(C`say\*(C'\fR (adds a \f(CW\*(C`say\*(C'\fR built-in function), and \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR
(adds a \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR keyword for declaring \*(L"static\*(R" variables). Those
features are described in their own sections of this document.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`feature\*(C'\fR pragma is also implicitly loaded when you require a minimal
perl version (with the \f(CW\*(C`use VERSION\*(C'\fR construct) greater than, or equal
to, 5.9.5. See feature for details.
.SS "New \fB\-E\fP command-line switch"
.IX Subsection "New -E command-line switch"
\&\fB\-E\fR is equivalent to \fB\-e\fR, but it implicitly enables all
optional features (like \f(CW\*(C`use feature ":5.10"\*(C'\fR).
.SS "Defined-or operator"
.IX Subsection "Defined-or operator"
A new operator \f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR (defined-or) has been implemented.
The following expression:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $a // $b
.Ve
.PP
is merely equivalent to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   defined $a ? $a : $b
.Ve
.PP
and the statement
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $c //= $d;
.Ve
.PP
can now be used instead of
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $c = $d unless defined $c;
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR operator has the same precedence and associativity as \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR.
Special care has been taken to ensure that this operator Do What You Mean
while not breaking old code, but some edge cases involving the empty
regular expression may now parse differently.  See perlop for
details.
.SS "Switch and Smart Match operator"
.IX Subsection "Switch and Smart Match operator"
Perl 5 now has a switch statement. It's available when \f(CW\*(C`use feature
\&\*(Aqswitch\*(Aq\*(C'\fR is in effect. This feature introduces three new keywords,
\&\f(CW\*(C`given\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`when\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    given ($foo) {
\&        when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; }
\&        when (/^def/) { $def = 1; }
\&        when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; }
\&        default { $nothing = 1; }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
A more complete description of how Perl matches the switch variable
against the \f(CW\*(C`when\*(C'\fR conditions is given in \*(L"Switch statements\*(R" in perlsyn.
.PP
This kind of match is called \fIsmart match\fR, and it's also possible to use
it outside of switch statements, via the new \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR operator. See
\&\*(L"Smart matching in detail\*(R" in perlsyn.
.PP
This feature was contributed by Robin Houston.
.SS "Regular expressions"
.IX Subsection "Regular expressions"
.IP "Recursive Patterns" 4
.IX Item "Recursive Patterns"
It is now possible to write recursive patterns without using the \f(CW\*(C`(??{})\*(C'\fR
construct. This new way is more efficient, and in many cases easier to
read.
.Sp
Each capturing parenthesis can now be treated as an independent pattern
that can be entered by using the \f(CW\*(C`(?PARNO)\*(C'\fR syntax (\f(CW\*(C`PARNO\*(C'\fR standing for
\&\*(L"parenthesis number\*(R"). For example, the following pattern will match
nested balanced angle brackets:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    /
\&     ^                      # start of line
\&     (                      # start capture buffer 1
\&        <                   #   match an opening angle bracket
\&        (?:                 #   match one of:
\&            (?>             #     don\*(Aqt backtrack over the inside of this group
\&                [^<>]+      #       one or more non angle brackets
\&            )               #     end non backtracking group
\&        |                   #     ... or ...
\&            (?1)            #     recurse to bracket 1 and try it again
\&        )*                  #   0 or more times.
\&        >                   #   match a closing angle bracket
\&     )                      # end capture buffer one
\&     $                      # end of line
\&    /x
.Ve
.Sp
\&\s-1PCRE\s0 users should note that Perl's recursive regex feature allows
backtracking into a recursed pattern, whereas in \s-1PCRE\s0 the recursion is
atomic or \*(L"possessive\*(R" in nature.  As in the example above, you can
add (?>) to control this selectively.  (Yves Orton)
.IP "Named Capture Buffers" 4
.IX Item "Named Capture Buffers"
It is now possible to name capturing parenthesis in a pattern and refer to
the captured contents by name. The naming syntax is \f(CW\*(C`(?<NAME>....)\*(C'\fR.
It's possible to backreference to a named buffer with the \f(CW\*(C`\ek<NAME>\*(C'\fR
syntax. In code, the new magical hashes \f(CW\*(C`%+\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`%\-\*(C'\fR can be used to
access the contents of the capture buffers.
.Sp
Thus, to replace all doubled chars with a single copy, one could write
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    s/(?<letter>.)\ek<letter>/$+{letter}/g
.Ve
.Sp
Only buffers with defined contents will be \*(L"visible\*(R" in the \f(CW\*(C`%+\*(C'\fR hash, so
it's possible to do something like
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    foreach my $name (keys %+) {
\&        print "content of buffer \*(Aq$name\*(Aq is $+{$name}\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`%\-\*(C'\fR hash is a bit more complete, since it will contain array refs
holding values from all capture buffers similarly named, if there should
be many of them.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`%+\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`%\-\*(C'\fR are implemented as tied hashes through the new module
\&\f(CW\*(C`Tie::Hash::NamedCapture\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Users exposed to the .NET regex engine will find that the perl
implementation differs in that the numerical ordering of the buffers
is sequential, and not \*(L"unnamed first, then named\*(R". Thus in the pattern
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   /(A)(?<B>B)(C)(?<D>D)/
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW$1\fR will be 'A', \f(CW$2\fR will be 'B', \f(CW$3\fR will be 'C' and \f(CW$4\fR will be 'D' and not
\&\f(CW$1\fR is 'A', \f(CW$2\fR is 'C' and \f(CW$3\fR is 'B' and \f(CW$4\fR is 'D' that a .NET programmer
would expect. This is considered a feature. :\-) (Yves Orton)
.IP "Possessive Quantifiers" 4
.IX Item "Possessive Quantifiers"
Perl now supports the \*(L"possessive quantifier\*(R" syntax of the \*(L"atomic match\*(R"
pattern. Basically a possessive quantifier matches as much as it can and never
gives any back. Thus it can be used to control backtracking. The syntax is
similar to non-greedy matching, except instead of using a '?' as the modifier
the '+' is used. Thus \f(CW\*(C`?+\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`*+\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`{min,max}+\*(C'\fR are now legal
quantifiers. (Yves Orton)
.IP "Backtracking control verbs" 4
.IX Item "Backtracking control verbs"
The regex engine now supports a number of special-purpose backtrack
control verbs: (*THEN), (*PRUNE), (*MARK), (*SKIP), (*COMMIT), (*FAIL)
and (*ACCEPT). See perlre for their descriptions. (Yves Orton)
.IP "Relative backreferences" 4
.IX Item "Relative backreferences"
A new syntax \f(CW\*(C`\eg{N}\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\egN\*(C'\fR where \*(L"N\*(R" is a decimal integer allows a
safer form of back-reference notation as well as allowing relative
backreferences. This should make it easier to generate and embed patterns
that contain backreferences. See \*(L"Capture buffers\*(R" in perlre. (Yves Orton)
.ie n .IP """\eK"" escape" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\eK\fR escape" 4
.IX Item "K escape"
The functionality of Jeff Pinyan's module Regexp::Keep has been added to
the core. In regular expressions you can now use the special escape \f(CW\*(C`\eK\*(C'\fR
as a way to do something like floating length positive lookbehind. It is
also useful in substitutions like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  s/(foo)bar/$1/g
.Ve
.Sp
that can now be converted to
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  s/foo\eKbar//g
.Ve
.Sp
which is much more efficient. (Yves Orton)
.IP "Vertical and horizontal whitespace, and linebreak" 4
.IX Item "Vertical and horizontal whitespace, and linebreak"
Regular expressions now recognize the \f(CW\*(C`\ev\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eh\*(C'\fR escapes that match
vertical and horizontal whitespace, respectively. \f(CW\*(C`\eV\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eH\*(C'\fR
logically match their complements.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eR\*(C'\fR matches a generic linebreak, that is, vertical whitespace, plus
the multi-character sequence \f(CW"\ex0D\ex0A"\fR.
.ie n .SS """say()"""
.el .SS "\f(CWsay()\fP"
.IX Subsection "say()"
\&\fIsay()\fR is a new built-in, only available when \f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqsay\*(Aq\*(C'\fR is in
effect, that is similar to \fIprint()\fR, but that implicitly appends a newline
to the printed string. See \*(L"say\*(R" in perlfunc. (Robin Houston)
.ie n .SS "Lexical $_"
.el .SS "Lexical \f(CW$_\fP"
.IX Subsection "Lexical $_"
The default variable \f(CW$_\fR can now be lexicalized, by declaring it like
any other lexical variable, with a simple
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $_;
.Ve
.PP
The operations that default on \f(CW$_\fR will use the lexically-scoped
version of \f(CW$_\fR when it exists, instead of the global \f(CW$_\fR.
.PP
In a \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR block, if \f(CW$_\fR was previously my'ed, then the
\&\f(CW$_\fR inside the block is lexical as well (and scoped to the block).
.PP
In a scope where \f(CW$_\fR has been lexicalized, you can still have access to
the global version of \f(CW$_\fR by using \f(CW$::_\fR, or, more simply, by
overriding the lexical declaration with \f(CW\*(C`our $_\*(C'\fR. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)
.ie n .SS "The ""_"" prototype"
.el .SS "The \f(CW_\fP prototype"
.IX Subsection "The _ prototype"
A new prototype character has been added. \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR but
defaults to \f(CW$_\fR if the corresponding argument isn't supplied (both \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR denote a scalar). Due to the optional nature of the argument, 
you can only use it at the end of a prototype, or before a semicolon.
.PP
This has a small incompatible consequence: the \fIprototype()\fR function has
been adjusted to return \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR for some built-ins in appropriate cases (for
example, \f(CW\*(C`prototype(\*(AqCORE::rmdir\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR). (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)
.SS "\s-1UNITCHECK\s0 blocks"
.IX Subsection "UNITCHECK blocks"
\&\f(CW\*(C`UNITCHECK\*(C'\fR, a new special code block has been introduced, in addition to
\&\f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`CHECK\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`INIT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`CHECK\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`INIT\*(C'\fR blocks, while useful for some specialized purposes,
are always executed at the transition between the compilation and the
execution of the main program, and thus are useless whenever code is
loaded at runtime. On the other hand, \f(CW\*(C`UNITCHECK\*(C'\fR blocks are executed
just after the unit which defined them has been compiled. See perlmod
for more information. (Alex Gough)
.ie n .SS "New Pragma, ""mro"""
.el .SS "New Pragma, \f(CWmro\fP"
.IX Subsection "New Pragma, mro"
A new pragma, \f(CW\*(C`mro\*(C'\fR (for Method Resolution Order) has been added. It
permits to switch, on a per-class basis, the algorithm that perl uses to
find inherited methods in case of a multiple inheritance hierarchy. The
default \s-1MRO\s0 hasn't changed (\s-1DFS\s0, for Depth First Search). Another \s-1MRO\s0 is
available: the C3 algorithm. See mro for more information.
(Brandon Black)
.PP
Note that, due to changes in the implementation of class hierarchy search,
code that used to undef the \f(CW*ISA\fR glob will most probably break. Anyway,
undef'ing \f(CW*ISA\fR had the side-effect of removing the magic on the \f(CW@ISA\fR
array and should not have been done in the first place. Also, the
cache \f(CW*::ISA::CACHE::\fR no longer exists; to force reset the \f(CW@ISA\fR cache,
you now need to use the \f(CW\*(C`mro\*(C'\fR \s-1API\s0, or more simply to assign to \f(CW@ISA\fR
(e.g. with \f(CW\*(C`@ISA = @ISA\*(C'\fR).
.ie n .SS "\fIreaddir()\fP may return a ""short filename"" on Windows"
.el .SS "\fIreaddir()\fP may return a ``short filename'' on Windows"
.IX Subsection "readdir() may return a short filename on Windows"
The \fIreaddir()\fR function may return a \*(L"short filename\*(R" when the long
filename contains characters outside the \s-1ANSI\s0 codepage.  Similarly
\&\fICwd::cwd()\fR may return a short directory name, and \fIglob()\fR may return short
names as well.  On the \s-1NTFS\s0 file system these short names can always be
represented in the \s-1ANSI\s0 codepage.  This will not be true for all other file
system drivers; e.g. the \s-1FAT\s0 filesystem stores short filenames in the \s-1OEM\s0
codepage, so some files on \s-1FAT\s0 volumes remain unaccessible through the
\&\s-1ANSI\s0 APIs.
.PP
Similarly, $^X, \f(CW@INC\fR, and \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1PATH\s0} are preprocessed at startup to make
sure all paths are valid in the \s-1ANSI\s0 codepage (if possible).
.PP
The \fIWin32::GetLongPathName()\fR function now returns the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded
correct long file name instead of using replacement characters to force
the name into the \s-1ANSI\s0 codepage.  The new \fIWin32::GetANSIPathName()\fR
function can be used to turn a long pathname into a short one only if the
long one cannot be represented in the \s-1ANSI\s0 codepage.
.PP
Many other functions in the \f(CW\*(C`Win32\*(C'\fR module have been improved to accept
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded arguments.  Please see Win32 for details.
.SS "\fIreadpipe()\fP is now overridable"
.IX Subsection "readpipe() is now overridable"
The built-in function \fIreadpipe()\fR is now overridable. Overriding it permits
also to override its operator counterpart, \f(CW\*(C`qx//\*(C'\fR (a.k.a. \f(CW\*(C`\`\`\*(C'\fR).
Moreover, it now defaults to \f(CW$_\fR if no argument is provided. (Rafael

.SS "\fIstate()\fP variables"
.IX Subsection "state() variables"
A new class of variables has been introduced. State variables are similar
to \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR variables, but are declared with the \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR keyword in place of
\&\f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR. They're visible only in their lexical scope, but their value is
persistent: unlike \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR variables, they're not undefined at scope entry,
but retain their previous value. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Nicholas Clark)
.PP
To use state variables, one needs to enable them by using
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use feature \*(Aqstate\*(Aq;

or by using the \f(CW\*(C`\-E\*(C'\fR command-line switch in one-liners.

.SS "Stacked filetest operators"

The \f(CW\*(C`UNIVERSAL\*(C'\fR class has a new method, \f(CW\*(C`DOES()\*(C'\fR. It has been added to
solve semantic problems with the \f(CW\*(C`isa()\*(C'\fR method. \f(CW\*(C`isa()\*(C'\fR checks for
inheritance, while \f(CW\*(C`DOES()\*(C'\fR has been designed to be overridden when

Formats were improved in several ways. A new field, \f(CW\*(C`^*\*(C'\fR, can be used for
variable-width, one-line-at-a-time text. Null characters are now handled
correctly in picture lines. Using \f(CW\*(C`@#\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR together will now

.SS "Exceptions in constant folding"
.IX Subsection "Exceptions in constant folding"
The constant folding routine is now wrapped in an exception handler, and
if folding throws an exception (such as attempting to evaluate 0/0), perl
now retains the current optree, rather than aborting the whole program.
Without this change, programs would not compile if they had expressions that
happened to generate exceptions, even though those expressions were in code
that could never be reached at runtime. (Nicholas Clark, Dave Mitchell)

.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Packing and \s-1UTF\-8\s0 strings"
.IX Subsection "Packing and UTF-8 strings"
The semantics of \fIpack()\fR and \fIunpack()\fR regarding UTF\-8\-encoded data has been
changed. Processing is now by default character per character instead of
byte per byte on the underlying encoding. Notably, code that used things
like \f(CW\*(C`pack("a*", $string)\*(C'\fR to see through the encoding of string will now
simply get back the original \f(CW$string\fR. Packed strings can also get upgraded
during processing when you store upgraded characters. You can get the old
behaviour by using \f(CW\*(C`use bytes\*(C'\fR.
.PP
To be consistent with \fIpack()\fR, the \f(CW\*(C`C0\*(C'\fR in \fIunpack()\fR templates indicates
that the data is to be processed in character mode, i.e. character by
character; on the contrary, \f(CW\*(C`U0\*(C'\fR in \fIunpack()\fR indicates \s-1UTF\-8\s0 mode, where
the packed string is processed in its UTF\-8\-encoded Unicode form on a byte
by byte basis. This is reversed with regard to perl 5.8.X, but now consistent
between \fIpack()\fR and \fIunpack()\fR.
.PP
Moreover, \f(CW\*(C`C0\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`U0\*(C'\fR can also be used in \fIpack()\fR templates to specify
respectively character and byte modes.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`C0\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`U0\*(C'\fR in the middle of a pack or unpack format now switch to the
specified encoding mode, honoring parens grouping. Previously, parens were
ignored.
.PP
Also, there is a new \fIpack()\fR character format, \f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR, which is intended to
replace the old \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR. \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR is kept for unsigned chars coded as bytes in
the strings internal representation. \f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR represents unsigned (logical)
character values, which can be greater than 255. It is therefore more
robust when dealing with potentially UTF\-8\-encoded data (as \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR will wrap
values outside the range 0..255, and not respect the string encoding).
.PP
In practice, that means that pack formats are now encoding-neutral, except
\&\f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For consistency, \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR in \fIunpack()\fR format now trims all Unicode whitespace
from the end of the string. Before perl 5.9.2, it used to strip only the
classical \s-1ASCII\s0 space characters.
.SS "Byte/character count feature in \fIunpack()\fP"

An old feature of perl was that before \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR look for a

with a \fI.pmc\fR extension. If this file is found, it will be loaded in
place of any potentially existing file ending in a \fI.pm\fR extension.

Previously, \fI.pmc\fR files were loaded only if more recent than the

The interpreter internals now support a far more memory efficient form of

table is equivalent to a full typeglob referencing a constant subroutine,
but using about 400 bytes less memory. This proxy constant subroutine is
automatically upgraded to a real typeglob with subroutine if necessary.
The approach taken is analogous to the existing space optimisation for
subroutine stub declarations, which are stored as plain scalars in place
of the full typeglob.

Several of the core modules have been converted to use this feature for

The regular expression engine is no longer recursive, meaning that
patterns that used to overflow the stack will either die with useful
explanations, or run to completion, which, since they were able to blow
the stack before, will likely take a very long time to happen. If you were

.IP "Trie optimisation of literal string alternations" 4
.IX Item "Trie optimisation of literal string alternations"
Alternations, where possible, are optimised into more efficient matching
structures. String literal alternations are merged into a trie and are
matched simultaneously.  This means that instead of O(N) time for matching
N alternations at a given point, the new code performs in O(1) time.
A new special variable, ${^RE_TRIE_MAXBUF}, has been added to fine-tune
this optimization. (Yves Orton)
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR Much code exists that works around perl's historic poor
performance on alternations. Often the tricks used to do so will disable
the new optimisations. Hopefully the utility modules used for this purpose
will be educated about these new optimisations.

.IP "\fIreaddir()\fR/\fIclosedir()\fR/etc. attempted on invalid dirhandle" 4
.IX Item "readdir()/closedir()/etc. attempted on invalid dirhandle"
These new warnings are now emitted when a dirhandle is used but is
either closed or not really a dirhandle.
.ie n .IP "Opening dirhandle/filehandle %s also as a file/directory" 4
.el .IP "Opening dirhandle/filehandle \f(CW%s\fR also as a file/directory" 4

.IP "Use of \-P is deprecated" 4
.IX Item "Use of -P is deprecated"
Perl's command-line switch \f(CW\*(C`\-P\*(C'\fR is now deprecated.
.IP "v\-string in use/require is non-portable" 4
.IX Item "v-string in use/require is non-portable"
Perl will warn you against potential backwards compatibility problems with
the \f(CW\*(C`use VERSION\*(C'\fR syntax.
.IP "perl \-V" 4
.IX Item "perl -V"
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR has several improvements, making it more useable from shell
scripts to get the value of configuration variables. See perlrun for
details.
.SH "Changed Internals"
.IX Header "Changed Internals"
In general, the source code of perl has been refactored, tidied up,
and optimized in many places. Also, memory management and allocation
has been improved in several points.
.PP
When compiling the perl core with gcc, as many gcc warning flags are
turned on as is possible on the platform.  (This quest for cleanliness
doesn't extend to \s-1XS\s0 code because we cannot guarantee the tidiness of
code we didn't write.)  Similar strictness flags have been added or
tightened for various other C compilers.
.SS "Reordering of SVt_* constants"
.IX Subsection "Reordering of SVt_* constants"
The relative ordering of constants that define the various types of \f(CW\*(C`SV\*(C'\fR
have changed; in particular, \f(CW\*(C`SVt_PVGV\*(C'\fR has been moved before \f(CW\*(C`SVt_PVLV\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`SVt_PVAV\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`SVt_PVHV\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SVt_PVCV\*(C'\fR.  This is unlikely to make any
difference unless you have code that explicitly makes assumptions about that
ordering. (The inheritance hierarchy of \f(CW\*(C`B::*\*(C'\fR objects has been changed
to reflect this.)
.SS "Elimination of SVt_PVBM"
.IX Subsection "Elimination of SVt_PVBM"
Related to this, the internal type \f(CW\*(C`SVt_PVBM\*(C'\fR has been removed. This
dedicated type of \f(CW\*(C`SV\*(C'\fR was used by the \f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR operator and parts of the
regexp engine to facilitate fast Boyer-Moore matches. Its use internally has
been replaced by \f(CW\*(C`SV\*(C'\fRs of type \f(CW\*(C`SVt_PVGV\*(C'\fR.
.SS "New type SVt_BIND"
.IX Subsection "New type SVt_BIND"
A new type \f(CW\*(C`SVt_BIND\*(C'\fR has been added, in readiness for the project to
implement Perl 6 on 5. There deliberately is no implementation yet, and
they cannot yet be created or destroyed.
.SS "Removal of \s-1CPP\s0 symbols"
.IX Subsection "Removal of CPP symbols"
The C preprocessor symbols \f(CW\*(C`PERL_PM_APIVERSION\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_XS_APIVERSION\*(C'\fR, which were supposed to give the version number of
the oldest perl binary-compatible (resp. source-compatible) with the
present one, were not used, and sometimes had misleading values. They have
been removed.
.SS "Less space is used by ops"
.IX Subsection "Less space is used by ops"
The \f(CW\*(C`BASEOP\*(C'\fR structure now uses less space. The \f(CW\*(C`op_seq\*(C'\fR field has been
removed and replaced by a single bit bit-field \f(CW\*(C`op_opt\*(C'\fR. \f(CW\*(C`op_type\*(C'\fR is now 9
bits long. (Consequently, the \f(CW\*(C`B::OP\*(C'\fR class doesn't provide an \f(CW\*(C`seq\*(C'\fR
method anymore.)
.SS "New parser"
.IX Subsection "New parser"
perl's parser is now generated by bison (it used to be generated by
byacc.) As a result, it seems to be a bit more robust.
.PP
Also, Dave Mitchell improved the lexer debugging output under \f(CW\*(C`\-DT\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS "Use of ""const"""
.el .SS "Use of \f(CWconst\fP"
.IX Subsection "Use of const"
Andy Lester supplied many improvements to determine which function
parameters and local variables could actually be declared \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR to the C
compiler. Steve Peters provided new \f(CW*_set\fR macros and reworked the core to
use these rather than assigning to macros in \s-1LVALUE\s0 context.
.SS "Mathoms"
.IX Subsection "Mathoms"
A new file, \fImathoms.c\fR, has been added. It contains functions that are
no longer used in the perl core, but that remain available for binary or
source compatibility reasons. However, those functions will not be
compiled in if you add \f(CW\*(C`\-DNO_MATHOMS\*(C'\fR in the compiler flags.
.ie n .SS """AvFLAGS"" has been removed"
.el .SS "\f(CWAvFLAGS\fP has been removed"
.IX Subsection "AvFLAGS has been removed"
The \f(CW\*(C`AvFLAGS\*(C'\fR macro has been removed.
.ie n .SS """av_*"" changes"
.el .SS "\f(CWav_*\fP changes"
.IX Subsection "av_* changes"
The \f(CW\*(C`av_*()\*(C'\fR functions, used to manipulate arrays, no longer accept null
\&\f(CW\*(C`AV*\*(C'\fR parameters.
.SS "$^H and %^H"
.IX Subsection "$^H and %^H"
The implementation of the special variables $^H and %^H has changed, to
allow implementing lexical pragmas in pure Perl.
.SS "B:: modules inheritance changed"
.IX Subsection "B:: modules inheritance changed"
The inheritance hierarchy of \f(CW\*(C`B::\*(C'\fR modules has changed; \f(CW\*(C`B::NV\*(C'\fR now
inherits from \f(CW\*(C`B::SV\*(C'\fR (it used to inherit from \f(CW\*(C`B::IV\*(C'\fR).
.SS "Anonymous hash and array constructors"
.IX Subsection "Anonymous hash and array constructors"
The anonymous hash and array constructors now take 1 op in the optree
instead of 3, now that pp_anonhash and pp_anonlist return a reference to
an hash/array when the op is flagged with OPf_SPECIAL. (Nicholas Clark)
.SH "Known Problems"
.IX Header "Known Problems"
There's still a remaining problem in the implementation of the lexical
\&\f(CW$_\fR: it doesn't work inside \f(CW\*(C`/(?{...})/\*(C'\fR blocks. (See the \s-1TODO\s0 test in
\&\fIt/op/mydef.t\fR.)
.PP
Stacked filetest operators won't work when the \f(CW\*(C`filetest\*(C'\fR pragma is in
effect, because they rely on the \fIstat()\fR buffer \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR being populated, and
filetest bypasses \fIstat()\fR.
.SS "\s-1UTF\-8\s0 problems"
.IX Subsection "UTF-8 problems"
The handling of Unicode still is unclean in several places, where it's
dependent on whether a string is internally flagged as \s-1UTF\-8\s0. This will
be made more consistent in perl 5.12, but that won't be possible without
a certain amount of backwards incompatibility.
.SH "Platform Specific Problems"
.IX Header "Platform Specific Problems"
When compiled with g++ and thread support on Linux, it's reported that the
\&\f(CW$!\fR stops working correctly. This is related to the fact that the glibc
provides two \fIstrerror_r\fR\|(3) implementation, and perl selects the wrong
one.

perl5143delta \- what is new for perl v5.14.3
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.14.2 release and
the 5.14.3 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and
5.14.0.

.el .SS "\f(CWDigest\fP unsafe use of eval (\s-1CVE\-2011\-3597\s0)"
.IX Subsection "Digest unsafe use of eval (CVE-2011-3597)"
The \f(CW\*(C`Digest\->new()\*(C'\fR function did not properly sanitize input before
using it in an \fIeval()\fR call, which could lead to the injection of arbitrary
Perl code.
.PP
In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker would need to be able to set
the algorithm name used, or be able to execute arbitrary Perl code already.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.
.SS "Heap buffer overrun in 'x' string repeat operator (\s-1CVE\-2012\-5195\s0)"
.IX Subsection "Heap buffer overrun in 'x' string repeat operator (CVE-2012-5195)"
Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify the count to
perl's 'x' string repeat operator can already cause a memory exhaustion
denial-of-service attack. A flaw in versions of perl before 5.15.5 can
escalate that into a heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions of glibc
before 2.16, it possibly allows the execution of arbitrary code.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any
exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

.IP "\(bu" 4
A regression has been fixed that was introduced in 5.14, in \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR
regular expression matching, in which a match improperly fails if the
pattern is in \s-1UTF\-8\s0, the target string is not, and a Latin\-1 character
precedes a character in the string that should match the pattern.  [perl
#101710]
.IP "\(bu" 4
In case-insensitive regular expression pattern matching, no longer on
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded strings does the scan for the start of match only look at
the first possible position.  This caused matches such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`"f\ex{FB00}" =~ /ff/i\*(C'\fR to fail.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The sitecustomize support was made relocatableinc aware, so that
\&\-Dusesitecustomize and \-Duserelocatableinc may be used together.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The smartmatch operator (\f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR) was changed so that the right-hand side
takes precedence during \f(CW\*(C`Any ~~ Object\*(C'\fR operations.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A bug has been fixed in the tainting support, in which an \f(CW\*(C`index()\*(C'\fR
operation on a tainted constant would cause all other constants to become
tainted.  [perl #64804]
.IP "\(bu" 4
A regression has been fixed that was introduced in perl 5.12, whereby
tainting errors were not correctly propagated through \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR.
[perl #111654]
.IP "\(bu" 4
A regression has been fixed that was introduced in perl 5.14, in which
\&\f(CW\*(C`/[[:lower:]]/i\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`/[[:upper:]]/i\*(C'\fR no longer matched the opposite case.

from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0 community for
helping Perl to flourish.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on \s-1CPAN\s0.

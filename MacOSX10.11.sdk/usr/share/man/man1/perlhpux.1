perlhpux \- Perl version 5 on Hewlett\-Packard Unix (HP\-UX) systems
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes various features of \s-1HP\s0's Unix operating system
(HP-UX) that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is
compiled and/or runs.
.SS "Using perl as shipped with HP-UX"
.IX Subsection "Using perl as shipped with HP-UX"
Application release September 2001, HP-UX 11.00 is the first to ship
with Perl. By the time it was perl\-5.6.1 in /opt/perl. The first
occurrence is on \s-1CD 5012\-7954\s0 and can be installed using
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  swinstall \-s /cdrom perl
.Ve
.PP
assuming you have mounted that \s-1CD\s0 on /cdrom.
.PP
That build was a portable hppa\-1.1 multithread build that supports large
files compiled with gcc\-2.9\-hppa\-991112.
.PP
If you perform a new installation, then (a newer) Perl will be installed
automatically.  Pre-installed HP-UX systems now have more recent versions
of Perl and the updated modules.
.PP
The official (threaded) builds from \s-1HP,\s0 as they are shipped on the
Application \s-1DVD/CD\s0's are available on
<http://www.software.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?productNumber=PERL>
for both PA-RISC and \s-1IPF \s0(Itanium Processor Family). They are built
with the \s-1HP\s0 ANSI-C compiler. Up till 5.8.8 that was done by ActiveState.
.PP
To see what version is included on the \s-1DVD \s0(assumed here to be mounted
on /cdrom), issue this command:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  # swlist \-s /cdrom perl
\&  # perl           D.5.8.8.B  5.8.8 Perl Programming Language

.SS "Using perl from \s-1HP\s0's porting centre"
.IX Subsection "Using perl from HP's porting centre"
\&\s-1HP\s0 porting centre tries to keep up with customer demand and release
updates from the Open Source community. Having precompiled Perl binaries
available is obvious, though \*(L"up-to-date\*(R" is something relative. At the
moment of writing only perl\-5.10.1 was available (with 5.16.3 being the
latest stable release from the porters point of view).
.PP
The \s-1HP\s0 porting centres are limited in what systems they are allowed
to port to and they usually choose the two most recent \s-1OS\s0 versions
available.
.PP
\&\s-1HP\s0 has asked the porting centre to move Open Source binaries
from /opt to /usr/local, so binaries produced since the start
of July 2002 are located in /usr/local.
.PP
One of \s-1HP\s0 porting centres \s-1URL\s0's is <http://hpux.connect.org.uk/>
The port currently available is built with \s-1GNU\s0 gcc.
.SS "Other prebuilt perl binaries"
.IX Subsection "Other prebuilt perl binaries"
To get even more recent perl depots for the whole range of HP-UX, visit
H.Merijn Brand's site at <http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/#Perl>.
Carefully read the notes to see if the available versions suit your needs.
.SS "Compiling Perl 5 on HP-UX"
.IX Subsection "Compiling Perl 5 on HP-UX"
When compiling Perl, you must use an \s-1ANSI C\s0 compiler.  The C compiler
that ships with all HP-UX systems is a K&R compiler that should only be
used to build new kernels.
.PP
Perl can be compiled with either \s-1HP\s0's \s-1ANSI C\s0 compiler or with gcc.  The
former is recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no
difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later that
require the use of \s-1HP\s0 compiler-specific command-line flags.
.PP
If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and
complete, and be sure to read the Perl \s-1INSTALL\s0 file for more gcc-specific
details.
.SS "PA-RISC"
.IX Subsection "PA-RISC"
\&\s-1HP\s0's \s-1HP9000\s0 Unix systems run on \s-1HP\s0's own Precision Architecture
(PA-RISC) chip.  HP-UX used to run on the Motorola \s-1MC68000\s0 family of
chips, but any machine with this chip in it is quite obsolete and this
document will not attempt to address issues for compiling Perl on the
Motorola chipset.
.PP
The version of PA-RISC at the time of this document's last update is 2.0,
which is also the last there will be. \s-1HP\s0 PA-RISC systems are usually
refered to with model description \*(L"\s-1HP 9000\*(R".\s0 The last \s-1CPU\s0 in this series
is the \s-1PA\-8900. \s0 Support for PA-RISC architectured machines officially
ends as shown in the following table:

An executable compiled on a PA-RISC 2.0 platform will not execute on a
PA-RISC 1.1 platform, even if they are running the same version of
HP-UX.  If you are building Perl on a PA-RISC 2.0 platform and want that
Perl to also run on a PA-RISC 1.1, the compiler flags +DAportable and
+DS32 should be used.
.PP
It is no longer possible to compile PA-RISC 1.0 executables on either
the PA-RISC 1.1 or 2.0 platforms.  The command-line flags are accepted,

.SS "Building Dynamic Extensions on HP-UX"
.IX Subsection "Building Dynamic Extensions on HP-UX"
HP-UX supports dynamically loadable libraries (shared libraries).
Shared libraries end with the suffix .sl.  On Itanium systems,
they end with the suffix .so.
.PP
Shared libraries created on a platform using a particular PA-RISC
version are not usable on platforms using an earlier PA-RISC version by
default.  However, this backwards compatibility may be enabled using the
same +DAportable compiler flag (with the same PA-RISC 1.0 caveat
mentioned above).
.PP
Shared libraries created on an Itanium platform cannot be loaded on
a PA-RISC platform.  Shared libraries created on a PA-RISC platform
can only be loaded on an Itanium platform if it is a PA-RISC executable
that is attempting to load the PA-RISC library.  A PA-RISC shared
library cannot be loaded into an Itanium executable nor vice-versa.
.PP
To create a shared library, the following steps must be performed:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  1. Compile source modules with +z or +Z flag to create a .o module
\&     which contains Position\-Independent Code (PIC).  The linker will
\&     tell you in the next step if +Z was needed.
\&     (For gcc, the appropriate flag is \-fpic or \-fPIC.)
\&
\&  2. Link the shared library using the \-b flag.  If the code calls
\&     any functions in other system libraries (e.g., libm), it must
\&     be included on this line.
.Ve
.PP
(Note that these steps are usually handled automatically by the extension's
Makefile).
.PP
If these dependent libraries are not listed at shared library creation
time, you will get fatal \*(L"Unresolved symbol\*(R" errors at run time when the
library is loaded.
.PP
You may create a shared library that refers to another library, which
may be either an archive library or a shared library.  If this second
library is a shared library, this is called a \*(L"dependent library\*(R".  The
dependent library's name is recorded in the main shared library, but it
is not linked into the shared library.  Instead, it is loaded when the
main shared library is loaded.  This can cause problems if you build an
extension on one system and move it to another system where the
libraries may not be located in the same place as on the first system.
.PP
If the referred library is an archive library, then it is treated as a
simple collection of .o modules (all of which must contain \s-1PIC\s0).  These
modules are then linked into the shared library.
.PP
Note that it is okay to create a library which contains a dependent
library that is already linked into perl.
.PP
Some extensions, like DB_File and Compress::Zlib use/require prebuilt
libraries for the perl extensions/modules to work. If these libraries
are built using the default configuration, it might happen that you
run into an error like \*(L"invalid loader fixup\*(R" during load phase.
\&\s-1HP\s0 is aware of this problem.  Search the HP-UX cxx-dev forums for
discussions about the subject.  The short answer is that \fBeverything\fR
(all libraries, everything) must be compiled with \f(CW\*(C`+z\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`+Z\*(C'\fR to be
\&\s-1PIC \s0(position independent code).  (For gcc, that would be
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-fpic\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-fPIC\*(C'\fR).  In HP-UX 11.00 or newer the linker
error message should tell the name of the offending object file.
.PP
A more general approach is to intervene manually, as with an example for
the DB_File module, which requires SleepyCat's libdb.sl:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  # cd .../db\-3.2.9/build_unix
\&  # vi Makefile
\&  ... add +Z to all cflags to create shared objects
\&  CFLAGS=         \-c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z \-Ae +O2 +Onolimit \e
\&                  \-I/usr/local/include \-I/usr/include/X11R6
\&  CXXFLAGS=       \-c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z \-Ae +O2 +Onolimit \e
\&                  \-I/usr/local/include \-I/usr/include/X11R6
\&
\&  # make clean
\&  # make
\&  # mkdir tmp
\&  # cd tmp
\&  # ar x ../libdb.a
\&  # ld \-b \-o libdb\-3.2.sl *.o
\&  # mv libdb\-3.2.sl /usr/local/lib
\&  # rm *.o
\&  # cd /usr/local/lib
\&  # rm \-f libdb.sl
\&  # ln \-s libdb\-3.2.sl libdb.sl
\&
\&  # cd .../DB_File\-1.76
\&  # make distclean
\&  # perl Makefile.PL
\&  # make
\&  # make test
\&  # make install
.Ve
.PP
As of db\-4.2.x it is no longer needed to do this by hand. Sleepycat
has changed the configuration process to add +z on HP-UX automatically.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  # cd .../db\-4.2.25/build_unix
\&  # env CFLAGS=+DD64 LDFLAGS=+DD64 ../dist/configure
.Ve
.PP
should work to generate 64bit shared libraries for HP-UX 11.00 and 11i.
.PP
It is no longer possible to link PA-RISC 1.0 shared libraries (even
though the command-line flags are still present).
.PP
PA-RISC and Itanium object files are not interchangeable.  Although
you may be able to use ar to create an archive library of PA-RISC
object files on an Itanium system, you cannot link against it using
an Itanium link editor.
.SS "The \s-1HP ANSI C\s0 Compiler"
.IX Subsection "The HP ANSI C Compiler"
When using this compiler to build Perl, you should make sure that the
flag \-Aa is added to the cpprun and cppstdin variables in the config.sh
file (though see the section on 64\-bit perl below). If you are using a
recent version of the Perl distribution, these flags are set automatically.
.PP
Even though HP-UX 10.20 and 11.00 are not actively maintained by \s-1HP\s0
anymore, updates for the \s-1HP ANSI C\s0 compiler are still available from
time to time, and it might be advisable to see if updates are applicable.
At the moment of writing, the latests available patches for 11.00 that
should be applied are \s-1PHSS_35098, PHSS_35175, PHSS_35100, PHSS_33036,\s0
and \s-1PHSS_33902\s0). If you have a \s-1SUM\s0 account, you can use it to search
for updates/patches. Enter \*(L"\s-1ANSI\*(R"\s0 as keyword.
.SS "The \s-1GNU C\s0 Compiler"
.IX Subsection "The GNU C Compiler"
When you are going to use the \s-1GNU C\s0 compiler (gcc), and you don't have
gcc yet, you can either build it yourself from the sources (available
from e.g. <http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html>) or fetch
a prebuilt binary from the \s-1HP\s0 porting center
at <http://hpux.connect.org.uk/hppd/cgi\-bin/search?term=gcc&Search=Search>
or from the \s-1DSPP \s0(you need to be a member) at
<http://h21007.www2.hp.com/portal/site/dspp/menuitem.863c3e4cbcdc3f3515b49c108973a801?ciid=2a08725cc2f02110725cc2f02110275d6e10RCRD&jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c\-001_title_r0001>
(Browse through the list, because there are often multiple versions of
the same package available).
.PP
Most mentioned distributions are depots. H.Merijn Brand has made prebuilt
gcc binaries available on <http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/> and/or
<http://www.cmve.net/~merijn/> for HP-UX 10.20 (only 32bit), HP-UX 11.00,
HP-UX 11.11 (HP-UX 11i v1), and HP-UX 11.23 (HP-UX 11i v2 PA-RISC) in both
32\- and 64\-bit versions. For HP-UX 11.23 \s-1IPF\s0 and HP-UX 11.31 \s-1IPF\s0 depots are
available too. The \s-1IPF\s0 versions do not need two versions of \s-1GNU\s0 gcc.
.PP
On PA-RISC you need a different compiler for 32\-bit applications and for
64\-bit applications. On PA-RISC, 32\-bit objects and 64\-bit objects do
not mix. Period. There is no different behaviour for \s-1HP\s0 C\-ANSI-C or \s-1GNU\s0
gcc. So if you require your perl binary to use 64\-bit libraries, like
Oracle\-64bit, you \s-1MUST\s0 build a 64\-bit perl.
.PP
Building a 64\-bit capable gcc on PA-RISC from source is possible only when
you have the \s-1HP C\-ANSI C\s0 compiler or an already working 64\-bit binary of
gcc available. Best performance for perl is achieved with \s-1HP\s0's native
compiler.
.SS "Using Large Files with Perl on HP-UX"
.IX Subsection "Using Large Files with Perl on HP-UX"
Beginning with HP-UX version 10.20, files larger than 2GB (2^31 bytes)
may be created and manipulated.  Three separate methods of doing this
are available.  Of these methods, the best method for Perl is to compile
using the \-Duselargefiles flag to Configure.  This causes Perl to be
compiled using structures and functions in which these are 64 bits wide,
rather than 32 bits wide.  (Note that this will only work with \s-1HP\s0's \s-1ANSI
C\s0 compiler.  If you want to compile Perl using gcc, you will have to get
a version of the compiler that supports 64\-bit operations. See above for
where to find it.)
.PP
There are some drawbacks to this approach.  One is that any extension
which calls any file-manipulating C function will need to be recompiled
(just follow the usual \*(L"perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install\*(R"
procedure).
.PP
The list of functions that will need to recompiled is:
  creat,          fgetpos,        fopen,
  freopen,        fsetpos,        fstat,
  fstatvfs,       fstatvfsdev,    ftruncate,
  ftw,            lockf,          lseek,
  lstat,          mmap,           nftw,
  open,           prealloc,       stat,
  statvfs,        statvfsdev,     tmpfile,
  truncate,       getrlimit,      setrlimit
.PP
Another drawback is only valid for Perl versions before 5.6.0.  This
drawback is that the seek and tell functions (both the builtin version
and \s-1POSIX\s0 module version) will not perform correctly.
.PP
It is strongly recommended that you use this flag when you run
Configure.  If you do not do this, but later answer the question about
large files when Configure asks you, you may get a configuration that
cannot be compiled, or that does not function as expected.
.SS "Threaded Perl on HP-UX"
.IX Subsection "Threaded Perl on HP-UX"
It is possible to compile a version of threaded Perl on any version of
HP-UX before 10.30, but it is strongly suggested that you be running on
HP-UX 11.00 at least.
.PP
To compile Perl with threads, add \-Dusethreads to the arguments of
Configure.  Verify that the \-D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L compiler flag is
automatically added to the list of flags.  Also make sure that \-lpthread
is listed before \-lc in the list of libraries to link Perl with. The
hints provided for HP-UX during Configure will try very hard to get
this right for you.
.PP
HP-UX versions before 10.30 require a separate installation of a \s-1POSIX\s0
threads library package. Two examples are the \s-1HP DCE\s0 package, available
on \*(L"HP-UX Hardware Extensions 3.0, Install and Core \s-1OS,\s0 Release 10.20,
April 1999 (B3920\-13941)\*(R" or the Freely available \s-1PTH\s0 package, available
on H.Merijn's site (<http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/>). The use of \s-1PTH\s0
will be unsupported in perl\-5.12 and up and is rather buggy in 5.11.x.
.PP
If you are going to use the \s-1HP DCE\s0 package, the library used for threading
is /usr/lib/libcma.sl, but there have been multiple updates of that
library over time. Perl will build with the first version, but it
will not pass the test suite. Older Oracle versions might be a compelling
reason not to update that library, otherwise please find a newer version
in one of the following patches: \s-1PHSS_19739, PHSS_20608,\s0 or \s-1PHSS_23672\s0

.SS "64\-bit Perl on HP-UX"
.IX Subsection "64-bit Perl on HP-UX"
Beginning with HP-UX 11.00, programs compiled under HP-UX can take
advantage of the \s-1LP64\s0 programming environment (\s-1LP64\s0 means Longs and
Pointers are 64 bits wide), in which scalar variables will be able
to hold numbers larger than 2^32 with complete precision.  Perl has
proven to be consistent and reliable in 64bit mode since 5.8.1 on
all HP-UX 11.xx.
.PP
As of the date of this document, Perl is fully 64\-bit compliant on
HP-UX 11.00 and up for both cc\- and gcc builds. If you are about to
build a 64\-bit perl with \s-1GNU\s0 gcc, please read the gcc section carefully.
.PP
Should a user have the need for compiling Perl in the \s-1LP64\s0 environment,
use the \-Duse64bitall flag to Configure.  This will force Perl to be
compiled in a pure \s-1LP64\s0 environment (with the +DD64 flag for \s-1HP\s0 C\-ANSI-C,
with no additional options for \s-1GNU\s0 gcc 64\-bit on PA-RISC, and with
\&\-mlp64 for \s-1GNU\s0 gcc on Itanium).
If you want to compile Perl using gcc, you will have to get a version of
the compiler that supports 64\-bit operations.)
.PP
You can also use the \-Duse64bitint flag to Configure.  Although there
are some minor differences between compiling Perl with this flag versus
the \-Duse64bitall flag, they should not be noticeable from a Perl user's
perspective. When configuring \-Duse64bitint using a 64bit gcc on a
pa-risc architecture, \-Duse64bitint is silently promoted to \-Duse64bitall.
.PP
In both cases, it is strongly recommended that you use these flags when
you run Configure.  If you do not use do this, but later answer the
questions about 64\-bit numbers when Configure asks you, you may get a
configuration that cannot be compiled, or that does not function as
expected.
.SS "Oracle on HP-UX"
.IX Subsection "Oracle on HP-UX"
Using perl to connect to Oracle databases through \s-1DBI\s0 and DBD::Oracle
has caused a lot of people many headaches. Read \s-1README\s0.hpux in the
DBD::Oracle for much more information. The reason to mention it here
is that Oracle requires a perl built with libcl and libpthread, the
latter even when perl is build without threads. Building perl using
all defaults, but still enabling to build DBD::Oracle later on can be
achieved using

.SS "\s-1GDBM\s0 and Threads on HP-UX"
.IX Subsection "GDBM and Threads on HP-UX"
If you attempt to compile Perl with (\s-1POSIX\s0) threads on an 11.X system
and also link in the \s-1GDBM\s0 library, then Perl will immediately core dump
when it starts up.  The only workaround at this point is to relink the
\&\s-1GDBM\s0 library under 11.X, then relink it into Perl.
.PP
the error might show something like:
.PP
Pthread internal error: message: _\|\fI_libc_reinit()\fR failed, file: ../pthreads/pthread.c, line: 1096

and Configure will give up.
.SS "\s-1NFS\s0 filesystems and \fIutime\fP\|(2) on HP-UX"
.IX Subsection "NFS filesystems and utime on HP-UX"
If you are compiling Perl on a remotely-mounted \s-1NFS\s0 filesystem, the test
io/fs.t may fail on test #18.  This appears to be a bug in HP-UX and no
fix is currently available.
.SS "HP-UX Kernel Parameters (maxdsiz) for Compiling Perl"
.IX Subsection "HP-UX Kernel Parameters (maxdsiz) for Compiling Perl"
By default, HP-UX comes configured with a maximum data segment size of
64MB.  This is too small to correctly compile Perl with the maximum
optimization levels.  You can increase the size of the maxdsiz kernel
parameter through the use of \s-1SAM.\s0
.PP
When using the \s-1GUI\s0 version of \s-1SAM,\s0 click on the Kernel Configuration
icon, then the Configurable Parameters icon.  Scroll down and select
the maxdsiz line.  From the Actions menu, select the Modify Configurable
Parameter item.  Insert the new formula into the Formula/Value box.
Then follow the instructions to rebuild your kernel and reboot your
system.
.PP
In general, a value of 256MB (or \*(L"256*1024*1024\*(R") is sufficient for
Perl to compile at maximum optimization.

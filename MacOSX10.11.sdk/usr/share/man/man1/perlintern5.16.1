.IX Header "CV reference counts and CvOUTSIDE"
.IP "CvWEAKOUTSIDE" 8
.IX Xref "CvWEAKOUTSIDE"
.IX Item "CvWEAKOUTSIDE"
Each \s-1CV\s0 has a pointer, \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE()\*(C'\fR, to its lexically enclosing
\&\s-1CV\s0 (if any). Because pointers to anonymous sub prototypes are
stored in \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR pad slots, it is a possible to get a circular reference,
with the parent pointing to the child and vice-versa. To avoid the
ensuing memory leak, we do not increment the reference count of the \s-1CV\s0
pointed to by \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR in the \fIone specific instance\fR that the parent
has a \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR pad slot pointing back to us. In this case, we set the
\&\f(CW\*(C`CvWEAKOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR flag in the child. This allows us to determine under what
circumstances we should decrement the refcount of the parent when freeing
the child.
.Sp
There is a further complication with non-closure anonymous subs (i.e. those
that do not refer to any lexicals outside that sub). In this case, the
anonymous prototype is shared rather than being cloned. This has the
consequence that the parent may be freed while there are still active
children, eg
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    BEGIN { $a = sub { eval \*(Aq$x\*(Aq } }
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, the \s-1BEGIN\s0 is freed immediately after execution since there
are no active references to it: the anon sub prototype has
\&\f(CW\*(C`CvWEAKOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR set since it's not a closure, and \f(CW$a\fR points to the same
\&\s-1CV\s0, so it doesn't contribute to \s-1BEGIN\s0's refcount either.  When \f(CW$a\fR is
executed, the \f(CW\*(C`eval \*(Aq$x\*(Aq\*(C'\fR causes the chain of \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE\*(C'\fRs to be followed,
and the freed \s-1BEGIN\s0 is accessed.
.Sp
To avoid this, whenever a \s-1CV\s0 and its associated pad is freed, any
\&\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR entries in the pad are explicitly removed from the pad, and if the
refcount of the pointed-to anon sub is still positive, then that
child's \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR is set to point to its grandparent. This will only
occur in the single specific case of a non-closure anon prototype
having one or more active references (such as \f(CW$a\fR above).
.Sp
One other thing to consider is that a \s-1CV\s0 may be merely undefined
rather than freed, eg \f(CW\*(C`undef &foo\*(C'\fR. In this case, its refcount may
not have reached zero, but we still delete its pad and its \f(CW\*(C`CvROOT\*(C'\fR etc.
Since various children may still have their \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR pointing at this
undefined \s-1CV\s0, we keep its own \f(CW\*(C`CvOUTSIDE\*(C'\fR for the time being, so that
the chain of lexical scopes is unbroken. For example, the following
should print 123:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    my $x = 123;
\&    sub tmp { sub { eval \*(Aq$x\*(Aq } }
\&    my $a = tmp();
\&    undef &tmp;

Returns the offset in the bottom pad of the lex or the fake lex.
cv is the \s-1CV\s0 in which to start the search, and seq is the current cop_seq
to match against. If warn is true, print appropriate warnings.  The out_*
vars return values, and so are pointers to where the returned values
should be stored. out_capture, if non-null, requests that the innermost
instance of the lexical is captured; out_name_sv is set to the innermost
matched namesv or fake namesv; out_flags returns the flags normally
associated with the \s-1IVX\s0 field of a fake namesv.
.Sp
Note that \fIpad_findlex()\fR is recursive; it recurses up the chain of CVs,
then comes back down, adding fake entries as it goes. It has to be this way
because fake namesvs in anon protoypes have to store in xlow the index into
the parent pad.

Creates a new \f(CW\*(C`refcounted_he\*(C'\fR.  This consists of a single key/value
pair and a reference to an existing \f(CW\*(C`refcounted_he\*(C'\fR chain (which may
be empty), and thus forms a longer chain.  When using the longer chain,
the new key/value pair takes precedence over any entry for the same key
further along the chain.
.Sp
The new key is specified by \fIkeypv\fR and \fIkeylen\fR.  If \fIflags\fR has
the \f(CW\*(C`REFCOUNTED_HE_KEY_UTF8\*(C'\fR bit set, the key octets are interpreted
as \s-1UTF\-8\s0, otherwise they are interpreted as Latin\-1.  \fIhash\fR is
a precomputed hash of the key string, or zero if it has not been
precomputed.
.Sp
\&\fIvalue\fR is the scalar value to store for this key.  \fIvalue\fR is copied
by this function, which thus does not take ownership of any reference
to it, and later changes to the scalar will not be reflected in the
value visible in the \f(CW\*(C`refcounted_he\*(C'\fR.  Complex types of scalar will not
be stored with referential integrity, but will be coerced to strings.
\&\fIvalue\fR may be either null or \f(CW&PL_sv_placeholder\fR to indicate that no
value is to be associated with the key; this, as with any non-null value,
takes precedence over the existence of a value for the key further along
the chain.

attached to the new \f(CW\*(C`refcounted_he\*(C'\fR.  This function takes ownership

Find the name of the undefined variable (if any) that caused the operator
to issue a \*(L"Use of uninitialized value\*(R" warning.
If match is true, only return a name if its value matches uninit_sv.
So roughly speaking, if a unary operator (such as \s-1OP_COS\s0) generates a
warning, then following the direct child of the op may yield an
\&\s-1OP_PADSV\s0 or \s-1OP_GV\s0 that gives the name of the undefined variable.  On the
other hand, with \s-1OP_ADD\s0 there are two branches to follow, so we only print
the variable name if we get an exact match.
.Sp
The name is returned as a mortal \s-1SV\s0.
.Sp
Assumes that PL_op is the op that originally triggered the error, and that
PL_comppad/PL_curpad points to the currently executing pad.

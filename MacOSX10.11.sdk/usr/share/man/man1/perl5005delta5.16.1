.SH "NAME"
perl5005delta \- what's new for perl5.005
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.004 release and this one.
.SH "About the new versioning system"
.IX Header "About the new versioning system"
Perl is now developed on two tracks: a maintenance track that makes
small, safe updates to released production versions with emphasis on
compatibility; and a development track that pursues more aggressive
evolution.  Maintenance releases (which should be considered production
quality) have subversion numbers that run from \f(CW1\fR to \f(CW49\fR, and
development releases (which should be considered \*(L"alpha\*(R" quality) run
from \f(CW50\fR to \f(CW99\fR.
.PP
Perl 5.005 is the combined product of the new dual-track development
scheme.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "\s-1WARNING:\s0  This version is not binary compatible with Perl 5.004."
.IX Subsection "WARNING:  This version is not binary compatible with Perl 5.004."
Starting with Perl 5.004_50 there were many deep and far-reaching changes
to the language internals.  If you have dynamically loaded extensions
that you built under perl 5.003 or 5.004, you can continue to use them
with 5.004, but you will need to rebuild and reinstall those extensions
to use them 5.005.  See \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR for detailed instructions on how to
upgrade.
.SS "Default installation structure has changed"
.IX Subsection "Default installation structure has changed"
The new Configure defaults are designed to allow a smooth upgrade from
5.004 to 5.005, but you should read \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR for a detailed
discussion of the changes in order to adapt them to your system.
.SS "Perl Source Compatibility"
.IX Subsection "Perl Source Compatibility"
When none of the experimental features are enabled, there should be
very few user-visible Perl source compatibility issues.
.PP
If threads are enabled, then some caveats apply. \f(CW@_\fR and \f(CW$_\fR become
lexical variables.  The effect of this should be largely transparent to
the user, but there are some boundary conditions under which user will
need to be aware of the issues.  For example, \f(CW\*(C`local(@_)\*(C'\fR results in
a \*(L"Can't localize lexical variable \f(CW@_\fR ...\*(R" message.  This may be enabled
in a future version.
.PP
Some new keywords have been introduced.  These are generally expected to
have very little impact on compatibility.  See "New \f(CW\*(C`INIT\*(C'\fR keyword",
"New \f(CW\*(C`lock\*(C'\fR keyword", and "New \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR operator".
.PP
Certain barewords are now reserved.  Use of these will provoke a warning
if you have asked for them with the \f(CW\*(C`\-w\*(C'\fR switch.
See "\f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR is now a reserved word".
.SS "C Source Compatibility"
.IX Subsection "C Source Compatibility"
There have been a large number of changes in the internals to support
the new features in this release.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Core sources now require \s-1ANSI\s0 C compiler
.Sp
An \s-1ANSI\s0 C compiler is now \fBrequired\fR to build perl.  See \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
All Perl global variables must now be referenced with an explicit prefix
.Sp
All Perl global variables that are visible for use by extensions now
have a \f(CW\*(C`PL_\*(C'\fR prefix.  New extensions should \f(CW\*(C`not\*(C'\fR refer to perl globals
by their unqualified names.  To preserve sanity, we provide limited
backward compatibility for globals that are being widely used like
\&\f(CW\*(C`sv_undef\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`na\*(C'\fR (which should now be written as \f(CW\*(C`PL_sv_undef\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_na\*(C'\fR etc.)
.Sp
If you find that your \s-1XS\s0 extension does not compile anymore because a
perl global is not visible, try adding a \f(CW\*(C`PL_\*(C'\fR prefix to the global
and rebuild.
.Sp
It is strongly recommended that all functions in the Perl \s-1API\s0 that don't
begin with \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR be referenced with a \f(CW\*(C`Perl_\*(C'\fR prefix.  The bare function
names without the \f(CW\*(C`Perl_\*(C'\fR prefix are supported with macros, but this
support may cease in a future release.
.Sp
See perlapi.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Enabling threads has source compatibility issues
.Sp
Perl built with threading enabled requires extensions to use the new
\&\f(CW\*(C`dTHR\*(C'\fR macro to initialize the handle to access per-thread data.
If you see a compiler error that talks about the variable \f(CW\*(C`thr\*(C'\fR not
being declared (when building a module that has \s-1XS\s0 code),  you need
to add \f(CW\*(C`dTHR;\*(C'\fR at the beginning of the block that elicited the error.
.Sp
The \s-1API\s0 function \f(CW\*(C`perl_get_sv("@",GV_ADD)\*(C'\fR should be used instead of
directly accessing perl globals as \f(CW\*(C`GvSV(errgv)\*(C'\fR.  The \s-1API\s0 call is
backward compatible with existing perls and provides source compatibility
with threading is enabled.
.Sp
See \*(L"C Source Compatibility\*(R" for more information.
.SS "Binary Compatibility"
.IX Subsection "Binary Compatibility"
This version is \s-1NOT\s0 binary compatible with older versions.  All extensions
will need to be recompiled.  Further binaries built with threads enabled
are incompatible with binaries built without.  This should largely be
transparent to the user, as all binary incompatible configurations have
their own unique architecture name, and extension binaries get installed at
unique locations.  This allows coexistence of several configurations in
the same directory hierarchy.  See \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR.
.SS "Security fixes may affect compatibility"
.IX Subsection "Security fixes may affect compatibility"
A few taint leaks and taint omissions have been corrected.  This may lead
to \*(L"failure\*(R" of scripts that used to work with older versions.  Compiling
with \-DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS provides a perl with minimal amounts of changes
to the tainting behavior.  But note that the resulting perl will have
known insecurities.
.PP
Oneliners with the \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR switch do not create temporary files anymore.
.SS "Relaxed new mandatory warnings introduced in 5.004"
.IX Subsection "Relaxed new mandatory warnings introduced in 5.004"
Many new warnings that were introduced in 5.004 have been made
optional.  Some of these warnings are still present, but perl's new
features make them less often a problem.  See \*(L"New Diagnostics\*(R".
.SS "Licensing"
.IX Subsection "Licensing"
Perl has a new Social Contract for contributors.  See \fIPorting/Contract\fR.
.PP
The license included in much of the Perl documentation has changed.
Most of the Perl documentation was previously under the implicit \s-1GNU\s0
General Public License or the Artistic License (at the user's choice).
Now much of the documentation unambiguously states the terms under which
it may be distributed.  Those terms are in general much less restrictive
than the \s-1GNU\s0 \s-1GPL\s0.  See perl and the individual perl manpages listed
therein.
.SH "Core Changes"
.IX Header "Core Changes"
.SS "Threads"
.IX Subsection "Threads"
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0 Threading is considered an \fBexperimental\fR feature.  Details of the
implementation may change without notice.  There are known limitations
and some bugs.  These are expected to be fixed in future versions.
.PP
See \fI\s-1README\s0.threads\fR.
.SS "Compiler"
.IX Subsection "Compiler"
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0 The Compiler and related tools are considered \fBexperimental\fR.
Features may change without notice, and there are known limitations
and bugs.  Since the compiler is fully external to perl, the default
configuration will build and install it.
.PP
The Compiler produces three different types of transformations of a
perl program.  The C backend generates C code that captures perl's state
just before execution begins.  It eliminates the compile-time overheads
of the regular perl interpreter, but the run-time performance remains
comparatively the same.  The \s-1CC\s0 backend generates optimized C code
equivalent to the code path at run-time.  The \s-1CC\s0 backend has greater
potential for big optimizations, but only a few optimizations are
implemented currently.  The Bytecode backend generates a platform
independent bytecode representation of the interpreter's state
just before execution.  Thus, the Bytecode back end also eliminates
much of the compilation overhead of the interpreter.
.PP
The compiler comes with several valuable utilities.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`B::Lint\*(C'\fR is an experimental module to detect and warn about suspicious
code, especially the cases that the \f(CW\*(C`\-w\*(C'\fR switch does not detect.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`B::Deparse\*(C'\fR can be used to demystify perl code, and understand
how perl optimizes certain constructs.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`B::Xref\*(C'\fR generates cross reference reports of all definition and use
of variables, subroutines and formats in a program.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`B::Showlex\*(C'\fR show the lexical variables used by a subroutine or file
at a glance.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`perlcc\*(C'\fR is a simple frontend for compiling perl.
.PP
See \f(CW\*(C`ext/B/README\*(C'\fR, B, and the respective compiler modules.
.SS "Regular Expressions"

.SS "Improved \fImalloc()\fP"
.IX Subsection "Improved malloc()"
See banner at the beginning of \f(CW\*(C`malloc.c\*(C'\fR for details.
.SS "Quicksort is internally implemented"
.IX Subsection "Quicksort is internally implemented"
Perl now contains its own highly optimized \fIqsort()\fR routine.  The new \fIqsort()\fR
is resistant to inconsistent comparison functions, so Perl's \f(CW\*(C`sort()\*(C'\fR will
not provoke coredumps any more when given poorly written sort subroutines.
(Some C library \f(CW\*(C`qsort()\*(C'\fRs that were being used before used to have this
problem.)  In our testing, the new \f(CW\*(C`qsort()\*(C'\fR required the minimal number
of pair-wise compares on average, among all known \f(CW\*(C`qsort()\*(C'\fR implementations.
.PP
See \f(CW\*(C`perlfunc/sort\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Reliable signals"
.IX Subsection "Reliable signals"
Perl's signal handling is susceptible to random crashes, because signals
arrive asynchronously, and the Perl runtime is not reentrant at arbitrary
times.
.PP
However, one experimental implementation of reliable signals is available
when threads are enabled.  See \f(CW\*(C`Thread::Signal\*(C'\fR.  Also see \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR for
how to build a Perl capable of threads.
.SS "Reliable stack pointers"
.IX Subsection "Reliable stack pointers"
The internals now reallocate the perl stack only at predictable times.
In particular, magic calls never trigger reallocations of the stack,
because all reentrancy of the runtime is handled using a \*(L"stack of stacks\*(R".
This should improve reliability of cached stack pointers in the internals
and in XSUBs.
.SS "More generous treatment of carriage returns"
.IX Subsection "More generous treatment of carriage returns"
Perl used to complain if it encountered literal carriage returns in
scripts.  Now they are mostly treated like whitespace within program text.
Inside string literals and here documents, literal carriage returns are
ignored if they occur paired with linefeeds, or get interpreted as whitespace
if they stand alone.  This behavior means that literal carriage returns
in files should be avoided.  You can get the older, more compatible (but
less generous) behavior by defining the preprocessor symbol
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_STRICT_CR\*(C'\fR when building perl.  Of course, all this has nothing
whatever to do with how escapes like \f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR are handled within strings.
.PP
Note that this doesn't somehow magically allow you to keep all text files
in \s-1DOS\s0 format.  The generous treatment only applies to files that perl
itself parses.  If your C compiler doesn't allow carriage returns in
files, you may still be unable to build modules that need a C compiler.
.SS "Memory leaks"
.IX Subsection "Memory leaks"
\&\f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pos\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vec\*(C'\fR don't leak memory anymore when used in lvalue
context.  Many small leaks that impacted applications that embed multiple
interpreters have been fixed.
.SS "Better support for multiple interpreters"
.IX Subsection "Better support for multiple interpreters"
The build-time option \f(CW\*(C`\-DMULTIPLICITY\*(C'\fR has had many of the details
reworked.  Some previously global variables that should have been
per-interpreter now are.  With care, this allows interpreters to call
each other.  See the \f(CW\*(C`PerlInterp\*(C'\fR extension on \s-1CPAN\s0.

.ie n .SS """Foo::"" can be used as implicitly quoted package name"

.IX Subsection "Foo:: can be used as implicitly quoted package name"
Barewords caused unintuitive behavior when a subroutine with the same
name as a package happened to be defined.  Thus, \f(CW\*(C`new Foo @args\*(C'\fR,
use the result of the call to \f(CW\*(C`Foo()\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`Foo\*(C'\fR being treated
as a literal.  The recommended way to write barewords in the indirect
object slot is \f(CW\*(C`new Foo:: @args\*(C'\fR.  Note that the method \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR is
called with a first argument of \f(CW\*(C`Foo\*(C'\fR, not \f(CW\*(C`Foo::\*(C'\fR when you do that.
.ie n .SS """exists $Foo::{Bar::}"" tests existence of a package"

Perl5 has always had 64\-bit support on systems with 64\-bit longs.
Starting with 5.005, the beginnings of experimental support for systems
with 32\-bit long and 64\-bit 'long long' integers has been added.
If you add \-DUSE_LONG_LONG to your ccflags in config.sh (or manually
define it in perl.h) then perl will be built with 'long long' support.
There will be many compiler warnings, and the resultant perl may not
work on all systems.  There are many other issues related to
third-party extensions and libraries.  This option exists to allow
people to work on those issues.

See \*(L"prototype\*(R" in perlfunc.
.SS "Extended support for exception handling"
.IX Subsection "Extended support for exception handling"
\&\f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR now accepts a reference value, and \f(CW$@\fR gets set to that

.IX Subsection "Magic lvalues are now more magical"
When you say something like \f(CW\*(C`substr($x, 5) = "hi"\*(C'\fR, the scalar returned
by \fIsubstr()\fR is special, in that any modifications to it affect \f(CW$x\fR.
(This is called a 'magic lvalue' because an 'lvalue' is something on
the left side of an assignment.)  Normally, this is exactly what you
would expect to happen, but Perl uses the same magic if you use \fIsubstr()\fR,
\&\fIpos()\fR, or \fIvec()\fR in a context where they might be modified, like taking
a reference with \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR or as an argument to a sub that modifies \f(CW@_\fR.
In previous versions, this 'magic' only went one way, but now changes
to the scalar the magic refers to ($x in the above example) affect the
magic lvalue too. For instance, this code now acts differently:
.PP

\&    $x = "hello";
\&    sub printit {
\&        $x = "g\*(Aqbye";

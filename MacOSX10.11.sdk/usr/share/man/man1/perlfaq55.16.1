You might like to read Mark Jason Dominus's \*(L"Suffering From Buffering\*(R"
at <http://perl.plover.com/FAQs/Buffering.html> .
.PP
Perl normally buffers output so it doesn't make a system call for every
bit of output. By saving up output, it makes fewer expensive system calls.
For instance, in this little bit of code, you want to print a dot to the
screen for every line you process to watch the progress of your program.
Instead of seeing a dot for every line, Perl buffers the output and you
have a long wait before you see a row of 50 dots all at once:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    # long wait, then row of dots all at once
\&    while( <> ) {
\&        print ".";
\&        print "\en" unless ++$count % 50;
\&
\&        #... expensive line processing operations
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
To get around this, you have to unbuffer the output filehandle, in this
case, \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR. You can set the special variable \f(CW$|\fR to a true value
(mnemonic: making your filehandles \*(L"piping hot\*(R"):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $|++;
\&
\&    # dot shown immediately
\&    while( <> ) {
\&        print ".";
\&        print "\en" unless ++$count % 50;
\&
\&        #... expensive line processing operations
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW$|\fR is one of the per-filehandle special variables, so each
filehandle has its own copy of its value. If you want to merge
standard output and standard error for instance, you have to unbuffer
each (although \s-1STDERR\s0 might be unbuffered by default):
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    {
\&        my $previous_default = select(STDOUT);  # save previous default
\&        $|++;                                   # autoflush STDOUT
\&        select(STDERR);
\&        $|++;                                   # autoflush STDERR, to be sure
\&        select($previous_default);              # restore previous default
\&    }
\&
\&    # now should alternate . and +
\&    while( 1 ) {
\&        sleep 1;
\&        print STDOUT ".";
\&        print STDERR "+";
\&        print STDOUT "\en" unless ++$count % 25;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Besides the \f(CW$|\fR special variable, you can use \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR to give
your filehandle a \f(CW\*(C`:unix\*(C'\fR layer, which is unbuffered:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    binmode( STDOUT, ":unix" );
\&
\&    while( 1 ) {
\&        sleep 1;
\&        print ".";
\&        print "\en" unless ++$count % 50;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
For more information on output layers, see the entries for \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR
and open in perlfunc, and the PerlIO module documentation.
.PP
If you are using IO::Handle or one of its subclasses, you can
call the \f(CW\*(C`autoflush\*(C'\fR method to change the settings of the
filehandle:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use IO::Handle;
\&    open my( $io_fh ), ">", "output.txt";
\&    $io_fh\->autoflush(1);
.Ve
.PP
The IO::Handle objects also have a \f(CW\*(C`flush\*(C'\fR method. You can flush
the buffer any time you want without auto-buffering
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $io_fh\->flush;
.Ve
.SS "How do I change, delete, or insert a line in a file, or append to the beginning of a file?"
.IX Xref "file, editing"
.IX Subsection "How do I change, delete, or insert a line in a file, or append to the beginning of a file?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
The basic idea of inserting, changing, or deleting a line from a text
file involves reading and printing the file to the point you want to
make the change, making the change, then reading and printing the rest
of the file. Perl doesn't provide random access to lines (especially
since the record input separator, \f(CW$/\fR, is mutable), although modules
such as Tie::File can fake it.
.PP
A Perl program to do these tasks takes the basic form of opening a
file, printing its lines, then closing the file:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    open my $in,  \*(Aq<\*(Aq,  $file      or die "Can\*(Aqt read old file: $!";
\&    open my $out, \*(Aq>\*(Aq, "$file.new" or die "Can\*(Aqt write new file: $!";
\&
\&    while( <$in> ) {
\&            print $out $_;
\&    }
\&
\&    close $out;
.Ve
.PP
Within that basic form, add the parts that you need to insert, change,
or delete lines.
.PP
To prepend lines to the beginning, print those lines before you enter
the loop that prints the existing lines.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    open my $in,  \*(Aq<\*(Aq,  $file      or die "Can\*(Aqt read old file: $!";
\&    open my $out, \*(Aq>\*(Aq, "$file.new" or die "Can\*(Aqt write new file: $!";
\&
\&    print $out "# Add this line to the top\en"; # <\-\-\- HERE\*(AqS THE MAGIC
\&
\&    while( <$in> ) {
\&            print $out $_;
\&    }
\&
\&    close $out;
.Ve
.PP
To change existing lines, insert the code to modify the lines inside
the \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR loop. In this case, the code finds all lowercased
versions of \*(L"perl\*(R" and uppercases them. The happens for every line, so
be sure that you're supposed to do that on every line!
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    open my $in,  \*(Aq<\*(Aq,  $file      or die "Can\*(Aqt read old file: $!";
\&    open my $out, \*(Aq>\*(Aq, "$file.new" or die "Can\*(Aqt write new file: $!";
\&
\&    print $out "# Add this line to the top\en";
\&
\&    while( <$in> ) {
\&        s/\eb(perl)\eb/Perl/g;
\&        print $out $_;
\&    }
\&
\&    close $out;
.Ve
.PP
To change only a particular line, the input line number, \f(CW$.\fR, is
useful. First read and print the lines up to the one you  want to
change. Next, read the single line you want to change, change it, and
print it. After that, read the rest of the lines and print those:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    while( <$in> ) { # print the lines before the change
\&        print $out $_;
\&        last if $. == 4; # line number before change
\&    }
\&
\&    my $line = <$in>;
\&    $line =~ s/\eb(perl)\eb/Perl/g;
\&    print $out $line;
\&
\&    while( <$in> ) { # print the rest of the lines
\&        print $out $_;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
To skip lines, use the looping controls. The \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR in this example
skips comment lines, and the \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR stops all processing once it
encounters either \f(CW\*(C`_\|_END_\|_\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DATA_\|_\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    while( <$in> ) {
\&        next if /^\es+#/;             # skip comment lines
\&        last if /^_\|_(END|DATA)_\|_$/;  # stop at end of code marker
\&        print $out $_;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Do the same sort of thing to delete a particular line by using \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR
to skip the lines you don't want to show up in the output. This
example skips every fifth line:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    while( <$in> ) {
\&        next unless $. % 5;
\&        print $out $_;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
If, for some odd reason, you really want to see the whole file at once
rather than processing line-by-line, you can slurp it in (as long as
you can fit the whole thing in memory!):
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    open my $in,  \*(Aq<\*(Aq,  $file      or die "Can\*(Aqt read old file: $!"
\&    open my $out, \*(Aq>\*(Aq, "$file.new" or die "Can\*(Aqt write new file: $!";
\&
\&    my @lines = do { local $/; <$in> }; # slurp!
\&
\&        # do your magic here
\&
\&    print $out @lines;
.Ve
.PP
Modules such as File::Slurp and Tie::File can help with that
too. If you can, however, avoid reading the entire file at once. Perl
won't give that memory back to the operating system until the process
finishes.
.PP
You can also use Perl one-liners to modify a file in-place. The
following changes all 'Fred' to 'Barney' in \fIinFile.txt\fR, overwriting
the file with the new contents. With the \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR switch, Perl wraps a
\&\f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR loop around the code you specify with \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR turns
on in-place editing. The current line is in \f(CW$_\fR. With \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR, Perl
automatically prints the value of \f(CW$_\fR at the end of the loop. See
perlrun for more details.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-pi \-e \*(Aqs/Fred/Barney/\*(Aq inFile.txt
.Ve
.PP
To make a backup of \f(CW\*(C`inFile.txt\*(C'\fR, give \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR a file extension to add:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-pi.bak \-e \*(Aqs/Fred/Barney/\*(Aq inFile.txt
.Ve
.PP
To change only the fifth line, you can add a test checking \f(CW$.\fR, the
input line number, then only perform the operation when the test
passes:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-pi \-e \*(Aqs/Fred/Barney/ if $. == 5\*(Aq inFile.txt
.Ve
.PP
To add lines before a certain line, you can add a line (or lines!)
before Perl prints \f(CW$_\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-pi \-e \*(Aqprint "Put before third line\en" if $. == 3\*(Aq inFile.txt
.Ve
.PP
You can even add a line to the beginning of a file, since the current
line prints at the end of the loop:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-pi \-e \*(Aqprint "Put before first line\en" if $. == 1\*(Aq inFile.txt
.Ve
.PP
To insert a line after one already in the file, use the \f(CW\*(C`\-n\*(C'\fR switch.
It's just like \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR except that it doesn't print \f(CW$_\fR at the end of
the loop, so you have to do that yourself. In this case, print \f(CW$_\fR
first, then print the line that you want to add.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-ni \-e \*(Aqprint; print "Put after fifth line\en" if $. == 5\*(Aq inFile.txt
.Ve
.PP
To delete lines, only print the ones that you want.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-ni \-e \*(Aqprint if /d/\*(Aq inFile.txt
.Ve
.SS "How do I count the number of lines in a file?"
.IX Xref "file, counting lines lines line"
.IX Subsection "How do I count the number of lines in a file?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
Conceptually, the easiest way to count the lines in a file is to
simply read them and count them:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $count = 0;
\&    while( <$fh> ) { $count++; }
.Ve
.PP
You don't really have to count them yourself, though, since Perl
already does that with the \f(CW$.\fR variable, which is the current line
number from the last filehandle read:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1 while( <$fh> );
\&    my $count = $.;
.Ve
.PP
If you want to use \f(CW$.\fR, you can reduce it to a simple one-liner,
like one of these:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    % perl \-lne \*(Aq} print $.; {\*(Aq    file
\&
\&    % perl \-lne \*(AqEND { print $. }\*(Aq file
.Ve
.PP
Those can be rather inefficient though. If they aren't fast enough for
you, you might just read chunks of data and count the number of
newlines:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    my $lines = 0;
\&    open my($fh), \*(Aq<:raw\*(Aq, $filename or die "Can\*(Aqt open $filename: $!";
\&    while( sysread $fh, $buffer, 4096 ) {
\&        $lines += ( $buffer =~ tr/\en// );
\&    }
\&    close FILE;
.Ve
.PP
However, that doesn't work if the line ending isn't a newline. You
might change that \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR to a \f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR so you can count the number of
times the input record separator, \f(CW$/\fR, shows up:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    my $lines = 0;
\&    open my($fh), \*(Aq<:raw\*(Aq, $filename or die "Can\*(Aqt open $filename: $!";
\&    while( sysread $fh, $buffer, 4096 ) {
\&        $lines += ( $buffer =~ s|$/||g; );
\&    }
\&    close FILE;
.Ve
.PP
If you don't mind shelling out, the \f(CW\*(C`wc\*(C'\fR command is usually the
fastest, even with the extra interprocess overhead. Ensure that you
have an untainted filename though:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!perl \-T
\&
\&    $ENV{PATH} = undef;
\&
\&    my $lines;
\&    if( $filename =~ /^([0\-9a\-z_.]+)\ez/ ) {
\&        $lines = \`/usr/bin/wc \-l $1\`
\&        chomp $lines;
\&    }
.Ve
.SS "How do I delete the last N lines from a file?"
.IX Xref "lines file"
.IX Subsection "How do I delete the last N lines from a file?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
The easiest conceptual solution is to count the lines in the
file then start at the beginning and print the number of lines
(minus the last N) to a new file.
.PP
Most often, the real question is how you can delete the last N lines
without making more than one pass over the file, or how to do it
without a lot of copying. The easy concept is the hard reality when
you might have millions of lines in your file.
.PP
One trick is to use File::ReadBackwards, which starts at the end of
the file. That module provides an object that wraps the real filehandle
to make it easy for you to move around the file. Once you get to the
spot you need, you can get the actual filehandle and work with it as
normal. In this case, you get the file position at the end of the last
line you want to keep and truncate the file to that point:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use File::ReadBackwards;
\&
\&    my $filename = \*(Aqtest.txt\*(Aq;
\&    my $Lines_to_truncate = 2;
\&
\&    my $bw = File::ReadBackwards\->new( $filename )
\&        or die "Could not read backwards in [$filename]: $!";
\&
\&    my $lines_from_end = 0;
\&    until( $bw\->eof or $lines_from_end == $Lines_to_truncate ) {
\&        print "Got: ", $bw\->readline;
\&        $lines_from_end++;
\&    }
\&
\&    truncate( $filename, $bw\->tell );
.Ve
.PP
The File::ReadBackwards module also has the advantage of setting
the input record separator to a regular expression.
.PP
You can also use the Tie::File module which lets you access
the lines through a tied array. You can use normal array operations
to modify your file, including setting the last index and using
\&\f(CW\*(C`splice\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS "How can I use Perl's ""\-i"" option from within a program?"
.el .SS "How can I use Perl's \f(CW\-i\fP option from within a program?"
.IX Xref "-i in-place"
.IX Subsection "How can I use Perl's -i option from within a program?"
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR sets the value of Perl's \f(CW$^I\fR variable, which in turn affects
the behavior of \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR; see perlrun for more details. By
modifying the appropriate variables directly, you can get the same
behavior within a larger program. For example:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    # ...
\&    {
\&        local($^I, @ARGV) = (\*(Aq.orig\*(Aq, glob("*.c"));
\&        while (<>) {
\&            if ($. == 1) {
\&                print "This line should appear at the top of each file\en";
\&            }
\&            s/\eb(p)earl\eb/${1}erl/i;        # Correct typos, preserving case
\&            print;
\&            close ARGV if eof;              # Reset $.
\&        }
\&    }
\&    # $^I and @ARGV return to their old values here
.Ve
.PP
This block modifies all the \f(CW\*(C`.c\*(C'\fR files in the current directory,
leaving a backup of the original data from each file in a new
\&\f(CW\*(C`.c.orig\*(C'\fR file.

open the original file, open the destination file, then print

If you don't need to know the name of the file, you can use \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR
with \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR in place of the file name. In Perl 5.8 or later, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR function creates an anonymous temporary file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    open my $tmp, \*(Aq+>\*(Aq, undef or die $!;
.Ve
.PP
Otherwise, you can use the File::Temp module.
.PP
.Vb 1

The File::Temp has been a standard module since Perl 5.6.1. If you
don't have a modern enough Perl installed, use the \f(CW\*(C`new_tmpfile\*(C'\fR
class method from the IO::File module to get a filehandle opened for
reading and writing. Use it if you don't need to know the file's name:
.PP

If you're committed to creating a temporary file by hand, use the
process \s-1ID\s0 and/or the current time-value. If you need to have many
temporary files in one process, use a counter:

We've used a hash slice in order to easily handle the fields of each row.
Storing the keys in an array makes it easy to operate on them as a
group or loop over them with \f(CW\*(C`for\*(C'\fR. It also avoids polluting the program
with global variables and using symbolic references.
.SS "How can I make a filehandle local to a subroutine? How do I pass filehandles between subroutines? How do I make an array of filehandles?"

.IX Subsection "How can I make a filehandle local to a subroutine? How do I pass filehandles between subroutines? How do I make an array of filehandles?"
As of perl5.6, \fIopen()\fR autovivifies file and directory handles
as references if you pass it an uninitialized scalar variable.
You can then pass these references just like any other scalar,
and use them in the place of named handles.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    open my    $fh, $file_name;

\&
\&    process_file( $fh );
.Ve
.PP
If you like, you can store these filehandles in an array or a hash.
If you access them directly, they aren't simple scalars and you
need to give \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR a little help by placing the filehandle
reference in braces. Perl can only figure it out on its own when
the filehandle reference is a simple scalar.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @fhs = ( $fh1, $fh2, $fh3 );
\&
\&    for( $i = 0; $i <= $#fhs; $i++ ) {

Before perl5.6, you had to deal with various typeglob idioms
which you may see in older code.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    open FILE, "> $filename";
\&    process_typeglob(   *FILE );
\&    process_reference( \e*FILE );
\&
\&    sub process_typeglob  { local *FH = shift; print FH  "Typeglob!" }
\&    sub process_reference { local $fh = shift; print $fh "Reference!" }
.Ve
.PP
If you want to create many anonymous handles, you should
check out the Symbol or IO::Handle modules.
.SS "How can I use a filehandle indirectly?"
.IX Xref "filehandle, indirect"
.IX Subsection "How can I use a filehandle indirectly?"
An indirect filehandle is the use of something other than a symbol
in a place that a filehandle is expected. Here are ways
to get indirect filehandles:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    $fh =   SOME_FH;       # bareword is strict\-subs hostile
\&    $fh =  "SOME_FH";      # strict\-refs hostile; same package only
\&    $fh =  *SOME_FH;       # typeglob
\&    $fh = \e*SOME_FH;       # ref to typeglob (bless\-able)
\&    $fh =  *SOME_FH{IO};   # blessed IO::Handle from *SOME_FH typeglob
.Ve
.PP
Or, you can use the \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR method from one of the IO::* modules to
create an anonymous filehandle and store that in a scalar variable.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use IO::Handle;                     # 5.004 or higher
\&    my $fh = IO::Handle\->new();
.Ve
.PP
Then use any of those as you would a normal filehandle. Anywhere that
Perl is expecting a filehandle, an indirect filehandle may be used
instead. An indirect filehandle is just a scalar variable that contains
a filehandle. Functions like \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR, or
the \f(CW\*(C`<FH>\*(C'\fR diamond operator will accept either a named filehandle
or a scalar variable containing one:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    ($ifh, $ofh, $efh) = (*STDIN, *STDOUT, *STDERR);
\&    print $ofh "Type it: ";
\&    my $got = <$ifh>
\&    print $efh "What was that: $got";
.Ve
.PP
If you're passing a filehandle to a function, you can write
the function in two ways:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub accept_fh {
\&        my $fh = shift;
\&        print $fh "Sending to indirect filehandle\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Or it can localize a typeglob and use the filehandle directly:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub accept_fh {
\&        local *FH = shift;
\&        print  FH "Sending to localized filehandle\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Both styles work with either objects or typeglobs of real filehandles.
(They might also work with strings under some circumstances, but this
is risky.)
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    accept_fh(*STDOUT);
\&    accept_fh($handle);
.Ve
.PP
In the examples above, we assigned the filehandle to a scalar variable
before using it. That is because only simple scalar variables, not
expressions or subscripts of hashes or arrays, can be used with
built-ins like \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR, or the diamond operator. Using
something other than a simple scalar variable as a filehandle is
illegal and won't even compile:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    my @fd = (*STDIN, *STDOUT, *STDERR);
\&    print $fd[1] "Type it: ";                           # WRONG
\&    my $got = <$fd[0]>                                  # WRONG
\&    print $fd[2] "What was that: $got";                 # WRONG
.Ve
.PP
With \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR, you get around this by using a block and
an expression where you would place the filehandle:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    print  { $fd[1] } "funny stuff\en";
\&    printf { $fd[1] } "Pity the poor %x.\en", 3_735_928_559;
\&    # Pity the poor deadbeef.
.Ve
.PP
That block is a proper block like any other, so you can put more
complicated code there. This sends the message out to one of two places:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $ok = \-x "/bin/cat";
\&    print { $ok ? $fd[1] : $fd[2] } "cat stat $ok\en";
\&    print { $fd[ 1+ ($ok || 0) ]  } "cat stat $ok\en";
.Ve
.PP
This approach of treating \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR like object methods
calls doesn't work for the diamond operator. That's because it's a
real operator, not just a function with a comma-less argument. Assuming
you've been storing typeglobs in your structure as we did above, you
can use the built-in function named \f(CW\*(C`readline\*(C'\fR to read a record just
as \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR does. Given the initialization shown above for \f(CW@fd\fR, this
would work, but only because \fIreadline()\fR requires a typeglob. It doesn't
work with objects or strings, which might be a bug we haven't fixed yet.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $got = readline($fd[0]);
.Ve
.PP
Let it be noted that the flakiness of indirect filehandles is not
related to whether they're strings, typeglobs, objects, or anything else.
It's the syntax of the fundamental operators. Playing the object
game doesn't help you at all here.

If you want to \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR into a string, you just have to <open> a
filehandle to a string, which Perl has been able to do since Perl 5.6:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    open FH, \*(Aq>\*(Aq, \emy $string;
\&    write( FH );
.Ve
.PP
Since you want to be a good programmer, you probably want to use a lexical
filehandle, even though formats are designed to work with bareword filehandles
since the default format names take the filehandle name. However, you can
control this with some Perl special per-filehandle variables: \f(CW$^\fR, which
names the top-of-page format, and \f(CW$~\fR which shows the line format. You have
to change the default filehandle to set these variables:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    open my($fh), \*(Aq>\*(Aq, \emy $string;
\&
\&    { # set per\-filehandle variables
\&        my $old_fh = select( $fh );
\&        $~ = \*(AqANIMAL\*(Aq;
\&        $^ = \*(AqANIMAL_TOP\*(Aq;
\&        select( $old_fh );
\&    }
\&
\&    format ANIMAL_TOP =
\&     ID  Type    Name
\&    .
\&
\&    format ANIMAL =
\&    @##   @<<<    @<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
\&    $id,  $type,  $name
\&    .
.Ve
.PP
Although write can work with lexical or package variables, whatever variables
you use have to scope in the format. That most likely means you'll want to
localize some package variables:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    {
\&        local( $id, $type, $name ) = qw( 12 cat Buster );
\&        write( $fh );
\&    }
\&
\&    print $string;
.Ve
.PP
There are also some tricks that you can play with \f(CW\*(C`formline\*(C'\fR and the
accumulator variable \f(CW$^A\fR, but you lose a lot of the value of formats
since \f(CW\*(C`formline\*(C'\fR won't handle paging and so on. You end up reimplementing
formats when you use them.

Since Perl 5.8.0 a file handle referring to a string can be created by
calling open with a reference to that string instead of the filename.
This file handle can then be used to read from or write to the string:

It may be more portable to use the File::Copy module instead.
You just copy to the new file to the new name (checking return
values), then delete the old one. This isn't really the same
semantically as a \f(CW\*(C`rename()\*(C'\fR, which preserves meta-information like
permissions, timestamps, inode info, etc.
.SS "How can I lock a file?"
.IX Xref "lock file, lock flock"
.IX Subsection "How can I lock a file?"
Perl's builtin \fIflock()\fR function (see perlfunc for details) will call
\&\fIflock\fR\|(2) if that exists, \fIfcntl\fR\|(2) if it doesn't (on perl version 5.004 and
later), and \fIlockf\fR\|(3) if neither of the two previous system calls exists.
On some systems, it may even use a different form of native locking.
Here are some gotchas with Perl's \fIflock()\fR:
.IP "1." 4
Produces a fatal error if none of the three system calls (or their
close equivalent) exists.
.IP "2." 4
\&\fIlockf\fR\|(3) does not provide shared locking, and requires that the
filehandle be open for writing (or appending, or read/writing).
.IP "3." 4
Some versions of \fIflock()\fR can't lock files over a network (e.g. on \s-1NFS\s0 file
systems), so you'd need to force the use of \fIfcntl\fR\|(2) when you build Perl.
But even this is dubious at best. See the flock entry of perlfunc
and the \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR file in the source distribution for information on
building Perl to do this.
.Sp
Two potentially non-obvious but traditional flock semantics are that
it waits indefinitely until the lock is granted, and that its locks are
\&\fImerely advisory\fR. Such discretionary locks are more flexible, but
offer fewer guarantees. This means that files locked with \fIflock()\fR may
be modified by programs that do not also use \fIflock()\fR. Cars that stop
for red lights get on well with each other, but not with cars that don't
stop for red lights. See the perlport manpage, your port's specific
documentation, or your system-specific local manpages for details. It's
best to assume traditional behavior if you're writing portable programs.
(If you're not, you should as always feel perfectly free to write
for your own system's idiosyncrasies (sometimes called \*(L"features\*(R").
Slavish adherence to portability concerns shouldn't get in the way of
your getting your job done.)

If you are on a system that correctly implements \f(CW\*(C`flock\*(C'\fR and you use
the example appending code from \*(L"perldoc \-f flock\*(R" everything will be
\&\s-1OK\s0 even if the \s-1OS\s0 you are on doesn't implement append mode correctly

If you know you are only going to use a system that does correctly
implement appending (i.e. not Win32) then you can omit the \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR
from the code in the previous answer.
.PP
If you know you are only writing code to run on an \s-1OS\s0 and filesystem
that does implement append mode correctly (a local filesystem on a
modern Unix for example), and you keep the file in block-buffered mode
and you write less than one buffer-full of output between each manual
flushing of the buffer then each bufferload is almost guaranteed to be
written to the end of the file in one chunk without getting
intermingled with anyone else's output. You can also use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`syswrite\*(C'\fR function which is simply a wrapper around your system's
\&\f(CWwrite(2)\fR system call.
.PP
There is still a small theoretical chance that a signal will interrupt
the system-level \f(CW\*(C`write()\*(C'\fR operation before completion. There is also
a possibility that some \s-1STDIO\s0 implementations may call multiple system
level \f(CW\*(C`write()\*(C'\fRs even if the buffer was empty to start. There may be
some systems where this probability is reduced to zero, and this is

.IX Subsection "How do I get a file's timestamp in perl?"
If you want to retrieve the time at which the file was last read,
written, or had its meta-data (owner, etc) changed, you use the \fB\-A\fR,
\&\fB\-M\fR, or \fB\-C\fR file test operations as documented in perlfunc.
These retrieve the age of the file (measured against the start-time of
your program) in days as a floating point number. Some platforms may
not have all of these times. See perlport for details. To retrieve
the \*(L"raw\*(R" time in seconds since the epoch, you would call the stat
function, then use \f(CW\*(C`localtime()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`gmtime()\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`POSIX::strftime()\*(C'\fR to convert this into human-readable form.
.PP
Here's an example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $write_secs = (stat($file))[9];
\&    printf "file %s updated at %s\en", $file,
\&        scalar localtime($write_secs);

If you prefer something more legible, use the File::stat module
(part of the standard distribution in version 5.004 and later):
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    # error checking left as an exercise for reader.
\&    use File::stat;
\&    use Time::localtime;
\&    my $date_string = ctime(stat($file)\->mtime);
\&    print "file $file updated at $date_string\en";

The \fIPOSIX::strftime()\fR approach has the benefit of being,
in theory, independent of the current locale. See perllocale
for details.
.SS "How do I set a file's timestamp in perl?"
.IX Xref "timestamp file, timestamp"
.IX Subsection "How do I set a file's timestamp in perl?"
You use the \fIutime()\fR function documented in \*(L"utime\*(R" in perlfunc.
By way of example, here's a little program that copies the

of them.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    if (@ARGV < 2) {
\&        die "usage: cptimes timestamp_file other_files ...\en";

Error checking is, as usual, left as an exercise for the reader.
.PP
The perldoc for utime also has an example that has the same
effect as \fItouch\fR\|(1) on files that \fIalready exist\fR.
.PP
Certain file systems have a limited ability to store the times
on a file at the expected level of precision. For example, the

a finer granularity than two seconds. This is a limitation of

The customary Perl approach for processing all the lines in a file is to
do so one line at a time:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    open my $input, \*(Aq<\*(Aq, $file or die "can\*(Aqt open $file: $!";
\&    while (<$input>) {
\&        chomp;
\&        # do something with $_
\&    }
\&    close $input or die "can\*(Aqt close $file: $!";
.Ve
.PP
This is tremendously more efficient than reading the entire file into
memory as an array of lines and then processing it one element at a time,
which is often\*(--if not almost always\*(--the wrong approach. Whenever
you see someone do this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @lines = <INPUT>;
.Ve
.PP
You should think long and hard about why you need everything loaded at
once. It's just not a scalable solution.
.PP
If you \*(L"mmap\*(R" the file with the File::Map module from
\&\s-1CPAN\s0, you can virtually load the entire file into a
string without actually storing it in memory:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use File::Map qw(map_file);
\&
\&    map_file my $string, $filename;
.Ve
.PP
Once mapped, you can treat \f(CW$string\fR as you would any other string.
Since you don't necessarily have to load the data, mmap-ing can be
very fast and may not increase your memory footprint.
.PP
You might also find it more
fun to use the standard Tie::File module, or the DB_File module's
\&\f(CW$DB_RECNO\fR bindings, which allow you to tie an array to a file so that
accessing an element of the array actually accesses the corresponding
line in the file.
.PP
If you want to load the entire file, you can use the File::Slurp
module to do it in one one simple and efficient step:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use File::Slurp;
\&
\&    my $all_of_it = read_file($filename); # entire file in scalar
\&    my @all_lines = read_file($filename); # one line per element
.Ve
.PP
Or you can read the entire file contents into a scalar like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    my $var;
\&    {
\&        local $/;
\&        open my $fh, \*(Aq<\*(Aq, $file or die "can\*(Aqt open $file: $!";
\&        $var = <$fh>;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
That temporarily undefs your record separator, and will automatically
close the file at block exit. If the file is already open, just use this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $var = do { local $/; <$fh> };
.Ve
.PP
You can also use a localized \f(CW@ARGV\fR to eliminate the \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $var = do { local( @ARGV, $/ ) = $file; <> };
.Ve
.PP
For ordinary files you can also use the \f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR function.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    read( $fh, $var, \-s $fh );
.Ve
.PP
That third argument tests the byte size of the data on the \f(CW$fh\fR filehandle
and reads that many bytes into the buffer \f(CW$var\fR.
.SS "How can I read in a file by paragraphs?"
.IX Xref "file, reading by paragraphs"
.IX Subsection "How can I read in a file by paragraphs?"
Use the \f(CW$/\fR variable (see perlvar for details). You can either
set it to \f(CW""\fR to eliminate empty paragraphs (\f(CW"abc\en\en\en\endef"\fR,
for instance, gets treated as two paragraphs and not three), or
\&\f(CW"\en\en"\fR to accept empty paragraphs.

filehandle (perhaps you used \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::open\*(C'\fR), you can use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`close()\*(C'\fR function from the \s-1POSIX\s0 module:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use POSIX ();
\&
\&    POSIX::close( $fd );
.Ve
.PP
This should rarely be necessary, as the Perl \f(CW\*(C`close()\*(C'\fR function is to be
used for things that Perl opened itself, even if it was a dup of a
numeric descriptor as with \f(CW\*(C`MHCONTEXT\*(C'\fR above. But if you really have
to, you may be able to do this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    require \*(Aqsys/syscall.ph\*(Aq;
\&    my $rc = syscall(&SYS_close, $fd + 0);  # must force numeric
\&    die "can\*(Aqt sysclose $fd: $!" unless $rc == \-1;
.Ve
.PP
Or, just use the fdopen(3S) feature of \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    {
\&        open my $fh, "<&=$fd" or die "Cannot reopen fd=$fd: $!";
\&        close $fh;
\&    }
.Ve

.IX Subsection "Why can't I use C:tempfoo in DOS paths? Why doesn't `C:tempfoo.exe` work?"
Whoops!  You just put a tab and a formfeed into that filename!
Remember that within double quoted strings (\*(L"like\ethis\*(R"), the
backslash is an escape character. The full list of these is in
\&\*(L"Quote and Quote-like Operators\*(R" in perlop. Unsurprisingly, you don't
have a file called \*(L"c:(tab)emp(formfeed)oo\*(R" or
\&\*(L"c:(tab)emp(formfeed)oo.exe\*(R" on your legacy \s-1DOS\s0 filesystem.
.PP
Either single-quote your strings, or (preferably) use forward slashes.
Since all \s-1DOS\s0 and Windows versions since something like MS-DOS 2.0 or so
have treated \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR the same in a path, you might as well use the
one that doesn't clash with Perl\*(--or the \s-1POSIX\s0 shell, \s-1ANSI\s0 C and \*(C+,
awk, Tcl, Java, or Python, just to mention a few. \s-1POSIX\s0 paths
are more portable, too.

.IX Xref "glob"
.IX Subsection "Why doesn't glob(*.*) get all the files?"
Because even on non-Unix ports, Perl's glob function follows standard
Unix globbing semantics. You'll need \f(CW\*(C`glob("*")\*(C'\fR to get all (non-hidden)
files. This makes \fIglob()\fR portable even to legacy systems. Your
port may include proprietary globbing functions as well. Check its
documentation for details.

.IX Subsection "Why does Perl let me delete read-only files? Why does -i clobber protected files? Isn't this a bug in Perl?"
This is elaborately and painstakingly described in the
\&\fIfile-dir-perms\fR article in the \*(L"Far More Than You Ever Wanted To
Know\*(R" collection in <http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz> .
.PP
The executive summary: learn how your filesystem works. The
permissions on a file say what can happen to the data in that file.
The permissions on a directory say what can happen to the list of
files in that directory. If you delete a file, you're removing its
name from the directory (so the operation depends on the permissions
of the directory, not of the file). If you try to write to the file,
the permissions of the file govern whether you're allowed to.
.SS "How do I select a random line from a file?"
.IX Xref "file, selecting a random line"
.IX Subsection "How do I select a random line from a file?"
Short of loading the file into a database or pre-indexing the lines in
the file, there are a couple of things that you can do.
.PP
Here's a reservoir-sampling algorithm from the Camel Book:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    srand;
\&    rand($.) < 1 && ($line = $_) while <>;
.Ve
.PP
This has a significant advantage in space over reading the whole file
in. You can find a proof of this method in \fIThe Art of Computer
Programming\fR, Volume 2, Section 3.4.2, by Donald E. Knuth.
.PP
You can use the File::Random module which provides a function
for that algorithm:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use File::Random qw/random_line/;
\&    my $line = random_line($filename);
.Ve
.PP
Another way is to use the Tie::File module, which treats the entire
file as an array. Simply access a random array element.
.SS "Why do I get weird spaces when I print an array of lines?"
.IX Subsection "Why do I get weird spaces when I print an array of lines?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
If you are seeing spaces between the elements of your array when
you print the array, you are probably interpolating the array in
double quotes:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my @animals = qw(camel llama alpaca vicuna);
\&    print "animals are: @animals\en";
.Ve
.PP
It's the double quotes, not the \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR, doing this. Whenever you
interpolate an array in a double quote context, Perl joins the
elements with spaces (or whatever is in \f(CW$"\fR, which is a space by
default):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    animals are: camel llama alpaca vicuna
.Ve
.PP
This is different than printing the array without the interpolation:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my @animals = qw(camel llama alpaca vicuna);
\&    print "animals are: ", @animals, "\en";
.Ve
.PP
Now the output doesn't have the spaces between the elements because
the elements of \f(CW@animals\fR simply become part of the list to
\&\f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    animals are: camelllamaalpacavicuna
.Ve
.PP
You might notice this when each of the elements of \f(CW@array\fR end with
a newline. You expect to print one element per line, but notice that
every line after the first is indented:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    this is a line
\&     this is another line
\&     this is the third line
.Ve
.PP
That extra space comes from the interpolation of the array. If you
don't want to put anything between your array elements, don't use the
array in double quotes. You can send it to print without them:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print @lines;
.Ve
.SS "How do I traverse a directory tree?"
.IX Subsection "How do I traverse a directory tree?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
The File::Find module, which comes with Perl, does all of the hard
work to traverse a directory structure. It comes with Perl. You simply
call the \f(CW\*(C`find\*(C'\fR subroutine with a callback subroutine and the
directories you want to traverse:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use File::Find;
\&
\&    find( \e&wanted, @directories );
\&
\&    sub wanted {
\&        # full path in $File::Find::name
\&        # just filename in $_
\&        ... do whatever you want to do ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The File::Find::Closures, which you can download from \s-1CPAN\s0, provides
many ready-to-use subroutines that you can use with File::Find.
.PP
The File::Finder, which you can download from \s-1CPAN\s0, can help you
create the callback subroutine using something closer to the syntax of
the \f(CW\*(C`find\*(C'\fR command-line utility:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use File::Find;
\&    use File::Finder;
\&
\&    my $deep_dirs = File::Finder\->depth\->type(\*(Aqd\*(Aq)\->ls\->exec(\*(Aqrmdir\*(Aq,\*(Aq{}\*(Aq);
\&
\&    find( $deep_dirs\->as_options, @places );
.Ve
.PP
The File::Find::Rule module, which you can download from \s-1CPAN\s0, has
a similar interface, but does the traversal for you too:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use File::Find::Rule;
\&
\&    my @files = File::Find::Rule\->file()
\&                             \->name( \*(Aq*.pm\*(Aq )
\&                             \->in( @INC );
.Ve

.IX Subsection "How do I delete a directory tree?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
If you have an empty directory, you can use Perl's built-in \f(CW\*(C`rmdir\*(C'\fR.
If the directory is not empty (so, no files or subdirectories), you
either have to empty it yourself (a lot of work) or use a module to
help you.
.PP
The File::Path module, which comes with Perl, has a \f(CW\*(C`remove_tree\*(C'\fR
which can take care of all of the hard work for you:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use File::Path qw(remove_tree);
\&
\&    remove_tree( @directories );
.Ve
.PP
The File::Path module also has a legacy interface to the older
\&\f(CW\*(C`rmtree\*(C'\fR subroutine.

To do the equivalent of \f(CW\*(C`cp \-R\*(C'\fR (i.e. copy an entire directory tree
recursively) in portable Perl, you'll either need to write something yourself
or find a good \s-1CPAN\s0 module such as  File::Copy::Recursive.

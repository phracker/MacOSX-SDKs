.\" For nroff, turn off justification.  Always turn off hyphenation; it makes
.\" way too many mistakes in technical documents.
.if n .ad l
.nh
.SH "NAME"
perl5144delta \- what is new for perl v5.14.4
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.14.3 release and
the 5.14.4 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and
5.14.0.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
No changes since 5.14.0.
.SH "Security"
.IX Header "Security"
This release contains one major, and medium, and a number of minor
security fixes.  The latter are included mainly to allow the test suite to
pass cleanly with the clang compiler's address sanitizer facility.
.SS "\s-1CVE\-2013\-1667:\s0 memory exhaustion with arbitrary hash keys"
.IX Subsection "CVE-2013-1667: memory exhaustion with arbitrary hash keys"
With a carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example arguments on a
\&\s-1URL\s0), it is possible to cause a hash to consume a large amount of memory
and \s-1CPU,\s0 and thus possibly to achieve a Denial-of-Service.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.
.SS "memory leak in Encode"
.IX Subsection "memory leak in Encode"
The \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoding implementation in Encode.xs had a memory leak which has been
fixed.
.SS "[perl #111594] Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un heap-buffer-overflow"
.IX Subsection "[perl #111594] Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un heap-buffer-overflow"
A read buffer overflow could occur when copying \f(CW\*(C`sockaddr\*(C'\fR buffers.
Fairly harmless.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.
.ie n .SS "[perl #111586] SDBM_File: fix off-by-one access to global "".dir"""
.el .SS "[perl #111586] SDBM_File: fix off-by-one access to global ``.dir''"
.IX Subsection "[perl #111586] SDBM_File: fix off-by-one access to global .dir"
An extra byte was being copied for some string literals. Fairly harmless.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.
.SS "off-by-two error in List::Util"
.IX Subsection "off-by-two error in List::Util"
A string literal was being used that included two bytes beyond the
end of the string. Fairly harmless.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.
.SS "[perl #115994] fix segv in regcomp.\fIc:S_join_exact()\fP"
.IX Subsection "[perl #115994] fix segv in regcomp.c:S_join_exact()"
Under debugging builds, while marking optimised-out regex nodes as type
\&\f(CW\*(C`OPTIMIZED\*(C'\fR, it could treat blocks of exact text as if they were nodes,
and thus \s-1SEGV.\s0 Fairly harmless.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.
.SS "[perl #115992] PL_eval_start use-after-free"
.IX Subsection "[perl #115992] PL_eval_start use-after-free"
The statement \f(CW\*(C`local $[;\*(C'\fR, when preceded by an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR, and when not part
of an assignment, could crash. Fairly harmless.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.
.SS "wrap-around with \s-1IO\s0 on long strings"
.IX Subsection "wrap-around with IO on long strings"
Reading or writing strings greater than 2**31 bytes in size could segfault
due to integer wraparound.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any
exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.
.SH "Deprecations"
.IX Header "Deprecations"
There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.

.IP "\s-1VMS\s0" 4
.IX Item "VMS"
5.14.3 failed to compile on \s-1VMS\s0 due to incomplete application of a patch
series that allowed \f(CW\*(C`userelocatableinc\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`usesitecustomize\*(C'\fR to be
used simultaneously.  Other platforms were not affected and the problem
has now been corrected.
.SH "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IX Header "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IP "\(bu" 4
In Perl 5.14.0, \f(CW\*(C`$tainted ~~ @array\*(C'\fR stopped working properly.  Sometimes
it would erroneously fail (when \f(CW$tainted\fR contained a string that occurs
in the array \fIafter\fR the first element) or erroneously succeed (when
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR occurred after the first element) [perl #93590].

.SH "Acknowledgements"

and contains approximately 1,700 lines of changes across 49 files from 12
authors.
.PP
Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community
of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the
improvements that became Perl 5.14.4:
.PP
Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Christian Hansen, Craig A. Berry,
Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, Father Chrysostomos,
Florian Ragwitz, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Yves Orton.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.
.PP
For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see
the \fI\s-1AUTHORS\s0\fR file in the Perl source distribution.
.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on \s-1CPAN.\s0

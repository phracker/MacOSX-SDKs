\& 
\&  Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
\&                     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110\-1301  USA
\& 
\&  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
\&  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\& 
\&                            Preamble
\& 
\&   The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
\& at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
\& License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
\& software\-\-to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
\& General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation\*(Aqs
\& software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
\& You can use it for your programs, too.
\& 
\&   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
\& price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
\& sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
\& software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
\& that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
\& programs; and that you know you can do these things.
\& 
\&   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
\& anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
\& These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
\& distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
\& 
\&   For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
\& gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
\& you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
\& source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
\& 
\&   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
\& (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
\& distribute and/or modify the software.
\& 
\&   Also, for each author\*(Aqs protection and ours, we want to make certain
\& that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
\& software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
\& want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
\& that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
\& authors\*(Aq reputations.
\& 
\&   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
\& modification follow.
\&  
\&                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\&    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\& 
\&   0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
\& contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
\& distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
\& "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
\& on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
\& Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
\& licensee is addressed as "you".
\& 
\&   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\*(Aqs source
\& code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
\& appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
\& disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
\& General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
\& other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
\& along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
\& transferring a copy.
\& 
\&   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
\& it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
\& 1 above, provided that you also do the following:
\& 
\&     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
\&     you changed the files and the date of any change; and
\& 
\&     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
\&     in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
\&     with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
\&     third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
\&     that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
\&     third parties, at your option).
\& 
\&     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
\&     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
\&     in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
\&     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
\&     that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
\&     warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
\&     conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
\&     Public License.
\& 
\&     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
\&     copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
\&     exchange for a fee.
\& 
\& Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
\& derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
\& the other work under the scope of these terms.
\&  
\&   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
\& it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
\& Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
\& 
\&     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine\-readable
\&     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
\&     Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
\& 
\&     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
\&     years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
\&     for the cost of distribution) a complete machine\-readable copy of the
\&     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
\&     Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
\& 
\&     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
\&     corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
\&     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
\&     received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
\& 
\& Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
\& modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
\& all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
\& exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
\& libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
\& file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
\& accompany that operating system.
\& 
\&   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
\& Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
\& Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
\& the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
\& the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
\& copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
\& License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
\& remain in full compliance.
\& 
\&   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
\& on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
\& and all its terms and conditions.
\& 
\&   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
\& Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
\& licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
\& terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
\& recipients\*(Aq exercise of the rights granted herein.
\&  
\&   7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
\& of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
\& be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
\& address new problems or concerns.
\& 
\& Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
\& specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
\& later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
\& either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
\& Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
\& the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
\& Foundation.
\& 
\&   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
\& programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
\& to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
\& Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
\& make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
\& of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
\& of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
\& 
\&                            NO WARRANTY
\& 
\&   9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
\& FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
\& OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
\& PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
\& OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
\& MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
\& TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
\& PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
\& REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\& 
\&   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
\& WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
\& REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
\& INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
\& OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
\& TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
\& YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
\& PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
\& POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\& 
\&                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\& 
\&        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
\& 
\&   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
\& possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
\& free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
\& terms.
\& 
\&   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
\& attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
\& the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
\& "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\& 
\&     <one line to give the program\*(Aqs name and a brief idea of what it does.>
\&     Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
\& 
\&     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
\&     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
\&     the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
\&     any later version.
\& 
\&     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
\&     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
\&     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
\&     GNU General Public License for more details.
\& 
\&     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
\&     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
\&     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA
\&     02110\-1301 USA
\& 
\& 
\& Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\& 
\& If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
\& when it starts in an interactive mode:
\& 
\&     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
\&     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \*(Aqshow w\*(Aq.
\&     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
\&     under certain conditions; type \*(Aqshow c\*(Aq for details.
\& 
\& The hypothetical commands \*(Aqshow w\*(Aq and \*(Aqshow c\*(Aq should show the
\& appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
\& commands you use may be called something other than \*(Aqshow w\*(Aq and \*(Aqshow
\& c\*(Aq; they could even be mouse\-clicks or menu items\-\-whatever suits your
\& program.
\& 
\& You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
\& school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
\& necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:

.SH "NAME"
perl5140delta \- what is new for perl v5.14.0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.12.0 release and
the 5.14.0 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.10.0, first read
perl5120delta, which describes differences between 5.10.0 and
5.12.0.
.PP
Some of the bug fixes in this release have been backported to subsequent
releases of 5.12.x.  Those are indicated with the 5.12.x version in
parentheses.
.SH "Notice"
.IX Header "Notice"
As described in perlpolicy, the release of Perl 5.14.0 marks the
official end of support for Perl 5.10.  Users of Perl 5.10 or earlier
should consider upgrading to a more recent release of Perl.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "Unicode"
.IX Subsection "Unicode"
\fIUnicode Version 6.0 is now supported (mostly)\fR
.IX Subsection "Unicode Version 6.0 is now supported (mostly)"
.PP
Perl comes with the Unicode 6.0 data base updated with
Corrigendum #8 <http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum8.html>,
with one exception noted below.
See <http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/> for details on the new
release.  Perl does not support any Unicode provisional properties,
including the new ones for this release.
.PP
Unicode 6.0 has chosen to use the name \f(CW\*(C`BELL\*(C'\fR for the character at U+1F514,
which is a symbol that looks like a bell, and is used in Japanese cell
phones.  This conflicts with the long-standing Perl usage of having
\&\f(CW\*(C`BELL\*(C'\fR mean the \s-1ASCII\s0 \f(CW\*(C`BEL\*(C'\fR character, U+0007.  In Perl 5.14,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{BELL}\*(C'\fR continues to mean U+0007, but its use generates a
deprecation warning message unless such warnings are turned off.  The
new name for U+0007 in Perl is \f(CW\*(C`ALERT\*(C'\fR, which corresponds nicely
with the existing shorthand sequence for it, \f(CW"\ea"\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`\eN{BEL}\*(C'\fR
means U+0007, with no warning given.  The character at U+1F514 has no
name in 5.14, but can be referred to by \f(CW\*(C`\eN{U+1F514}\*(C'\fR. 
In Perl 5.16, \f(CW\*(C`\eN{BELL}\*(C'\fR will refer to U+1F514; all code
that uses \f(CW\*(C`\eN{BELL}\*(C'\fR should be converted to use \f(CW\*(C`\eN{ALERT}\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{BEL}\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW"\ea"\fR before upgrading.
.PP
\fIFull functionality for \f(CI\*(C`use feature \*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Full functionality for use feature unicode_strings"
.PP
This release provides full functionality for \f(CW\*(C`use feature
\&\*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.  Under its scope, all string operations executed and
regular expressions compiled (even if executed outside its scope) have
Unicode semantics.  See \*(L"the 'unicode_strings' feature\*(R" in feature.
However, see \*(L"Inverted bracketed character classes and multi-character folds\*(R",
below.
.PP
This feature avoids most forms of the \*(L"Unicode Bug\*(R" (see
\&\*(L"The \*(R"Unicode Bug"" in perlunicode for details).  If there is any
possibility that your code will process Unicode strings, you are
\&\fIstrongly\fR encouraged to use this subpragma to avoid nasty surprises.

\fI\f(CI\*(C`\eN{\f(CINAME\f(CI}\*(C'\fI and \f(CI\*(C`charnames\*(C'\fI enhancements\fR
.IX Subsection "N{NAME} and charnames enhancements"
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{\f(CINAME\f(CW}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`charnames::vianame\*(C'\fR now know about the abbreviated
character names listed by Unicode, such as \s-1NBSP\s0, \s-1SHY\s0, \s-1LRO\s0, \s-1ZWJ\s0, etc.; all
customary abbreviations for the C0 and C1 control characters (such as
\&\s-1ACK\s0, \s-1BEL\s0, \s-1CAN\s0, etc.); and a few new variants of some C1 full names that
are in common usage.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Unicode has several \fInamed character sequences\fR, in which particular sequences
of code points are given names.  \f(CW\*(C`\eN{\f(CINAME\f(CW}\*(C'\fR now recognizes these.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{\f(CINAME\f(CW}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`charnames::vianame\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`charnames::viacode\*(C'\fR
now know about every character in Unicode.  In earlier releases of
Perl, they didn't know about the Hangul syllables nor several
\&\s-1CJK\s0 (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) characters.
.IP "\(bu" 4
It is now possible to override Perl's abbreviations with your own custom aliases.
.IP "\(bu" 4
You can now create a custom alias of the ordinal of a
character, known by \f(CW\*(C`\eN{\f(CINAME\f(CW}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`charnames::vianame()\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`charnames::viacode()\*(C'\fR.  Previously, aliases had to be to official
Unicode character names.  This made it impossible to create an alias for
unnamed code points, such as those reserved for private
use.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The new function \fIcharnames::string_vianame()\fR is a run-time version
of \f(CW\*(C`\eN{\f(CINAME\f(CW}}\*(C'\fR, returning the string of characters whose Unicode
name is its parameter.  It can handle Unicode named character
sequences, whereas the pre-existing \fIcharnames::vianame()\fR cannot,
as the latter returns a single code point.
.PP
See charnames for details on all these changes.
.PP
\fINew warnings categories for problematic (non\-)Unicode code points.\fR
.IX Subsection "New warnings categories for problematic (non-)Unicode code points."
.PP
Three new warnings subcategories of \*(L"utf8\*(R" have been added.  These
allow you to turn off some \*(L"utf8\*(R" warnings, while allowing
other warnings to remain on.  The three categories are:
\&\f(CW\*(C`surrogate\*(C'\fR when \s-1UTF\-16\s0 surrogates are encountered;
\&\f(CW\*(C`nonchar\*(C'\fR when Unicode non-character code points are encountered;
and \f(CW\*(C`non_unicode\*(C'\fR when code points above the legal Unicode
maximum of 0x10FFFF are encountered.
.PP
\fIAny unsigned value can be encoded as a character\fR
.IX Subsection "Any unsigned value can be encoded as a character"
.PP
With this release, Perl is adopting a model that any unsigned value
can be treated as a code point and encoded internally (as utf8)
without warnings, not just the code points that are legal in Unicode.
However, unless utf8 or the corresponding sub-category (see previous
item) of lexical warnings have been explicitly turned off, outputting
or executing a Unicode-defined operation such as upper-casing
on such a code point generates a warning.  Attempting to input these
using strict rules (such as with the \f(CW\*(C`:encoding(UTF\-8)\*(C'\fR layer)
will continue to fail.  Prior to this release, handling was
inconsistent and in places, incorrect.
.PP
Unicode non-characters, some of which previously were erroneously
considered illegal in places by Perl, contrary to the Unicode Standard,
are now always legal internally.  Inputting or outputting them 
works the same as with the non-legal Unicode code points, because the Unicode
Standard says they are (only) illegal for \*(L"open interchange\*(R".
.PP
\fIUnicode database files not installed\fR
.IX Subsection "Unicode database files not installed"
.PP
The Unicode database files are no longer installed with Perl.  This
doesn't affect any functionality in Perl and saves significant disk
space.  If you need these files, you can download them from
<http://www.unicode.org/Public/zipped/6.0.0/>.
.SS "Regular Expressions"
.IX Subsection "Regular Expressions"
\fI\f(CI\*(C`(?^...)\*(C'\fI construct signifies default modifiers\fR
.IX Subsection "(?^...) construct signifies default modifiers"
.PP
An \s-1ASCII\s0 caret \f(CW"^"\fR immediately following a \f(CW"(?"\fR in a regular
expression now means that the subexpression does not inherit surrounding
modifiers such as \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR, but reverts to the Perl defaults.  Any modifiers
following the caret override the defaults.
.PP
Stringification of regular expressions now uses this notation.  
For example, \f(CW\*(C`qr/hlagh/i\*(C'\fR would previously be stringified as
\&\f(CW\*(C`(?i\-xsm:hlagh)\*(C'\fR, but now it's stringified as \f(CW\*(C`(?^i:hlagh)\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The main purpose of this change is to allow tests that rely on the
stringification \fInot\fR to have to change whenever new modifiers are added.
See \*(L"Extended Patterns\*(R" in perlre.
.PP
This change is likely to break code that compares stringified regular
expressions with fixed strings containing \f(CW\*(C`?\-xism\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`/d\*(C'\fI, \f(CI\*(C`/l\*(C'\fI, \f(CI\*(C`/u\*(C'\fI, and \f(CI\*(C`/a\*(C'\fI modifiers\fR
.IX Subsection "/d, /l, /u, and /a modifiers"
.PP
Four new regular expression modifiers have been added.  These are mutually
exclusive: one only can be turned on at a time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`/l\*(C'\fR modifier says to compile the regular expression as if it were
in the scope of \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR, even if it is not.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`/u\*(C'\fR modifier says to compile the regular expression as if it were
in the scope of a \f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq\*(C'\fR pragma.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`/d\*(C'\fR (default) modifier is used to override any \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq\*(C'\fR pragmas in effect at the time
of compiling the regular expression.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`/a\*(C'\fR regular expression modifier restricts \f(CW\*(C`\es\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\ed\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\ew\*(C'\fR and
the \s-1POSIX\s0 (\f(CW\*(C`[[:posix:]]\*(C'\fR) character classes to the \s-1ASCII\s0 range.  Their
complements and \f(CW\*(C`\eb\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eB\*(C'\fR are correspondingly
affected.  Otherwise, \f(CW\*(C`/a\*(C'\fR behaves like the \f(CW\*(C`/u\*(C'\fR modifier, in that
case-insensitive matching uses Unicode semantics.
.Sp
If the \f(CW\*(C`/a\*(C'\fR modifier is repeated, then additionally in case-insensitive
matching, no \s-1ASCII\s0 character can match a non-ASCII character.
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    "k"     =~ /\eN{KELVIN SIGN}/ai
\&    "\exDF" =~ /ss/ai
.Ve
.Sp
match but
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    "k"    =~ /\eN{KELVIN SIGN}/aai
\&    "\exDF" =~ /ss/aai
.Ve
.Sp
do not match.
.PP
See \*(L"Modifiers\*(R" in perlre for more detail.
.PP
\fINon-destructive substitution\fR
.IX Subsection "Non-destructive substitution"
.PP
The substitution (\f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR) and transliteration
(\f(CW\*(C`y///\*(C'\fR) operators now support an \f(CW\*(C`/r\*(C'\fR option that
copies the input variable, carries out the substitution on
the copy, and returns the result.  The original remains unmodified.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my $old = "cat";
\&  my $new = $old =~ s/cat/dog/r;
\&  # $old is "cat" and $new is "dog"
.Ve
.PP
This is particularly useful with \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR.  See perlop for more examples.
.PP
\fIRe-entrant regular expression engine\fR
.IX Subsection "Re-entrant regular expression engine"
.PP
It is now safe to use regular expressions within \f(CW\*(C`(?{...})\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`(??{...})\*(C'\fR code blocks inside regular expressions.
.PP
These blocks are still experimental, however, and still have problems with
lexical (\f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR) variables and abnormal exiting.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`use re \*(Aq/flags\*(Aq\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "use re /flags"
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`re\*(C'\fR pragma now has the ability to turn on regular expression flags
till the end of the lexical scope:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use re "/x";
\&    "foo" =~ / (.+) /;  # /x implied
.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"'/flags' mode\*(R" in re for details.
.PP
\fI\eo{...} for octals\fR
.IX Subsection "o{...} for octals"
.PP
There is a new octal escape sequence, \f(CW"\eo"\fR, in doublequote-like
contexts.  This construct allows large octal ordinals beyond the
current max of 0777 to be represented.  It also allows you to specify a
character in octal which can safely be concatenated with other regex
snippets and which won't be confused with being a backreference to
a regex capture group.  See \*(L"Capture groups\*(R" in perlre.
.PP
\fIAdd \f(CI\*(C`\ep{Titlecase}\*(C'\fI as a synonym for \f(CI\*(C`\ep{Title}\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Add p{Titlecase} as a synonym for p{Title}"
.PP
This synonym is added for symmetry with the Unicode property names
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{Uppercase}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Lowercase}\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIRegular expression debugging output improvement\fR
.IX Subsection "Regular expression debugging output improvement"
.PP
Regular expression debugging output (turned on by \f(CW\*(C`use re \*(Aqdebug\*(Aq\*(C'\fR) now

.PP
\fIReturn value of \f(CI\*(C`delete $+{...}\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Return value of delete $+{...}"
.PP
Custom regular expression engines can now determine the return value of

\fISingle term prototype\fR
.IX Subsection "Single term prototype"
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR prototype is a special alternative to \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR that acts like
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e[@%]\*(C'\fR when given a literal array or hash variable, but will otherwise
force scalar context on the argument.  See \*(L"Prototypes\*(R" in perlsub.
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`package\*(C'\fI block syntax\fR
.IX Subsection "package block syntax"
.PP
A package declaration can now contain a code block, in which case the
declaration is in scope inside that block only.  So \f(CW\*(C`package Foo { ... }\*(C'\fR
is precisely equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`{ package Foo; ... }\*(C'\fR.  It also works with
a version number in the declaration, as in \f(CW\*(C`package Foo 1.2 { ... }\*(C'\fR, 
which is its most attractive feature.  See perlfunc.
.PP
\fIStatement labels can appear in more places\fR

Multiple statement labels can now appear before a single statement.

\fIUppercase X/B allowed in hexadecimal/binary literals\fR
.IX Subsection "Uppercase X/B allowed in hexadecimal/binary literals"
.PP
Literals may now use either upper case \f(CW\*(C`0X...\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`0B...\*(C'\fR prefixes,
in addition to the already supported \f(CW\*(C`0x...\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`0b...\*(C'\fR
syntax [perl #76296].
.PP
C, Ruby, Python, and \s-1PHP\s0 already support this syntax, and it makes
Perl more internally consistent: a round-trip with \f(CW\*(C`eval sprintf

.SS "Exception Handling"
.IX Subsection "Exception Handling"
To make them more reliable and consistent, several changes have been made
to how \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW$@\fR behave.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When an exception is thrown inside an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR, the exception is no
longer at risk of being clobbered by destructor code running during unwinding.
Previously, the exception was written into \f(CW$@\fR
early in the throwing process, and would be overwritten if \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR was
used internally in the destructor for an object that had to be freed
while exiting from the outer \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR.  Now the exception is written
into \f(CW$@\fR last thing before exiting the outer \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR, so the code
running immediately thereafter can rely on the value in \f(CW$@\fR correctly
corresponding to that \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR.  (\f(CW$@\fR is still also set before exiting the
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR, for the sake of destructors that rely on this.)
.Sp
Likewise, a \f(CW\*(C`local $@\*(C'\fR inside an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR no longer clobbers any
exception thrown in its scope.  Previously, the restoration of \f(CW$@\fR upon
unwinding would overwrite any exception being thrown.  Now the exception
gets to the \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR anyway.  So \f(CW\*(C`local $@\*(C'\fR is safe before a \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Exceptions thrown from object destructors no longer modify the \f(CW$@\fR
of the surrounding context.  (If the surrounding context was exception
unwinding, this used to be another way to clobber the exception being
thrown.)  Previously such an exception was
sometimes emitted as a warning, and then either was
string-appended to the surrounding \f(CW$@\fR or completely replaced the
surrounding \f(CW$@\fR, depending on whether that exception and the surrounding
\&\f(CW$@\fR were strings or objects.  Now, an exception in this situation is
always emitted as a warning, leaving the surrounding \f(CW$@\fR untouched.
In addition to object destructors, this also affects any function call
run by \s-1XS\s0 code using the \f(CW\*(C`G_KEEPERR\*(C'\fR flag.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Warnings for \f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR can now be objects in the same way as exceptions
for \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.  If an object-based warning gets the default handling
of writing to standard error, it is stringified as before with the
filename and line number appended.  But a \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR handler now
receives an object-based warning as an object, where previously it
was passed the result of stringifying the object.

On Linux the legacy process name is now set with \fIprctl\fR\|(2), in
addition to altering the \s-1POSIX\s0 name via \f(CW\*(C`argv[0]\*(C'\fR, as Perl has done
since version 4.000.  Now system utilities that read the legacy process
name such as \fIps\fR, \fItop\fR, and \fIkillall\fR recognize the name you set when
assigning to \f(CW$0\fR.  The string you supply is truncated at 16 bytes;
this limitation is imposed by Linux.

\fI\fIsrand()\fI now returns the seed\fR
.IX Subsection "srand() now returns the seed"
.PP
This allows programs that need to have repeatable results not to have to come
up with their own seed-generating mechanism.  Instead, they can use \fIsrand()\fR
and stash the return value for future use.  One example is a test program with
too many combinations to test comprehensively in the time available for
each run.  It can test a random subset each time and, should there be a failure,
log the seed used for that run so this can later be used to produce the same results.

\fIprintf-like functions understand post\-1980 size modifiers\fR

(\f(CW\*(C`size_t\*(C'\fR), and \*(L"t\*(R" (\f(CW\*(C`ptrdiff_t\*(C'\fR).  Also, when compiled with a C99
compiler, Perl now understands the size modifier \*(L"j\*(R" (\f(CW\*(C`intmax_t\*(C'\fR)

\fI\f(CI\*(C`\-d:\-foo\*(C'\fI calls \f(CI\*(C`Devel::foo::unimport\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "-d:-foo calls Devel::foo::unimport"
.PP
The syntax \fB\-d:foo\fR was extended in 5.6.1 to make \fB\-d:foo=bar\fR
equivalent to \fB\-MDevel::foo=bar\fR, which expands
internally to \f(CW\*(C`use Devel::foo \*(Aqbar\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.
Perl now allows prefixing the module name with \fB\-\fR, with the same
semantics as \fB\-M\fR; that is:
.ie n .IP """\-d:\-foo""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-d:\-foo\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d:-foo"
Equivalent to \fB\-M\-Devel::foo\fR: expands to
\&\f(CW\*(C`no Devel::foo\*(C'\fR and calls \f(CW\*(C`Devel::foo\->unimport()\*(C'\fR
if that method exists.
.ie n .IP """\-d:\-foo=bar""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-d:\-foo=bar\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d:-foo=bar"
Equivalent to \fB\-M\-Devel::foo=bar\fR: expands to \f(CW\*(C`no Devel::foo \*(Aqbar\*(Aq\*(C'\fR,
and calls \f(CW\*(C`Devel::foo\->unimport("bar")\*(C'\fR if that method exists.
.PP
This is particularly useful for suppressing the default actions of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`Devel::*\*(C'\fR module's \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR method whilst still loading it for debugging.
.PP
\fIFilehandle method calls load IO::File on demand\fR
.IX Subsection "Filehandle method calls load IO::File on demand"
.PP
When a method call on a filehandle would die because the method cannot
be resolved and IO::File has not been loaded, Perl now loads IO::File
via \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR and attempts method resolution again:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  open my $fh, ">", $file;
\&  $fh\->binmode(":raw");     # loads IO::File and succeeds
.Ve
.PP
This also works for globs like \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  STDOUT\->autoflush(1);
.Ve
.PP
Because this on-demand load happens only if method resolution fails, the
legacy approach of manually loading an IO::File parent class for partial
method support still works as expected:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  use IO::Handle;
\&  open my $fh, ">", $file;
\&  $fh\->autoflush(1);        # IO::File not loaded

.IX Subsection "Inverted bracketed character classes and multi-character folds"

Some characters match a sequence of two or three characters in \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR
regular expression matching under Unicode rules.  One example is
\&\f(CW\*(C`LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S\*(C'\fR which matches the sequence \f(CW\*(C`ss\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& \*(Aqss\*(Aq =~ /\eA[\eN{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]\ez/i  # Matches
.Ve
.PP
This, however, can lead to very counter-intuitive results, especially
when inverted.  Because of this, Perl 5.14 does not use multi-character \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR
matching in inverted character classes.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& \*(Aqss\*(Aq =~ /\eA[^\eN{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]+\ez/i  # ???
.Ve
.PP
This should match any sequences of characters that aren't the \f(CW\*(C`SHARP S\*(C'\fR
nor what \f(CW\*(C`SHARP S\*(C'\fR matches under \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW"s"\fR isn't \f(CW\*(C`SHARP S\*(C'\fR, but
Unicode says that \f(CW"ss"\fR is what \f(CW\*(C`SHARP S\*(C'\fR matches under \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR.  So
which one \*(L"wins\*(R"? Do you fail the match because the string has \f(CW\*(C`ss\*(C'\fR or
accept it because it has an \f(CW\*(C`s\*(C'\fR followed by another \f(CW\*(C`s\*(C'\fR?
.PP
Earlier releases of Perl did allow this multi-character matching,
but due to bugs, it mostly did not work.

.PP
In certain circumstances, \f(CW\*(C`\e400\*(C'\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`\e777\*(C'\fR in regexes have behaved
differently than they behave in all other doublequote-like contexts.
Since 5.10.1, Perl has issued a deprecation warning when this happens.
Now, these literals behave the same in all doublequote-like contexts,
namely to be equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`\ex{100}\*(C'\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`\ex{1FF}\*(C'\fR, with no deprecation
warning.
.PP
Use of \f(CW\*(C`\e400\*(C'\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`\e777\*(C'\fR in the command-line option \fB\-0\fR retain their
conventional meaning.  They slurp whole input files; previously, this
was documented only for \fB\-0777\fR.

Because of various ambiguities, you should use the new

.PP
\fIMost \f(CI\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fI properties are now immune to case-insensitive matching\fR
.IX Subsection "Most p{} properties are now immune to case-insensitive matching"
.PP
For most Unicode properties, it doesn't make sense to have them match
differently under \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR case-insensitive matching.  Doing so can lead
to unexpected results and potential security holes.  For example
.PP
.Vb 1
\& m/\ep{ASCII_Hex_Digit}+/i
.Ve
.PP
could previously match non-ASCII characters because of the Unicode
matching rules (although there were several bugs with this).  Now
matching under \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR gives the same results as non\-\f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR matching except
for those few properties where people have come to expect differences,
namely the ones where casing is an integral part of their meaning, such
as \f(CW\*(C`m/\ep{Uppercase}/i\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`m/\ep{Lowercase}/i\*(C'\fR, both of which match
the same code points as matched by \f(CW\*(C`m/\ep{Cased}/i\*(C'\fR.
Details are in \*(L"Unicode Properties\*(R" in perlrecharclass.
.PP
User-defined property handlers that need to match differently under \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR
must be changed to read the new boolean parameter passed to them, which
is non-zero if case-insensitive matching is in effect and 0 otherwise.

Previously, one regular expression interpolated into another inherited
the localeness of the surrounding regex, losing whatever state it

.PP
\fIStringification of regexes has changed\fR
.IX Subsection "Stringification of regexes has changed"
.PP
Default regular expression modifiers are now notated using
\&\f(CW\*(C`(?^...)\*(C'\fR.  Code relying on the old stringification will fail.  
This is so that when new modifiers are added, such code won't
have to keep changing each time this happens, because the stringification 
will automatically incorporate the new modifiers.
.PP
Code that needs to work properly with both old\- and new-style regexes
can avoid the whole issue by using (for perls since 5.9.5; see re):
.PP
.Vb 2
\& use re qw(regexp_pattern);
\& my ($pat, $mods) = regexp_pattern($re_ref);
.Ve
.PP
If the actual stringification is important or older Perls need to be
supported, you can use something like the following:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # Accept both old and new\-style stringification
\&    my $modifiers = (qr/foobar/ =~ /\eQ(?^/) ? "^" : "\-xism";

\&  use re "eval";
\&  $foo =~ $bar; # when $bar contains (?{...})

.IX Subsection "Stashes are now always defined"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`defined %Foo::\*(C'\fR now always returns true, even when no symbols have yet been

.PP
This is a side-effect of removing a special-case kludge in the tokeniser,
added for 5.10.0, to hide side-effects of changes to the internal storage of
hashes.  The fix drastically reduces hashes' memory overhead.
.PP
Calling defined on a stash has been deprecated since 5.6.0, warned on
lexicals since 5.6.0, and warned for stashes and other package
variables since 5.12.0.  \f(CW\*(C`defined %hash\*(C'\fR has always exposed an
implementation detail: emptying a hash by deleting all entries from it does
not make \f(CW\*(C`defined %hash\*(C'\fR false.  Hence \f(CW\*(C`defined %hash\*(C'\fR is not valid code to
determine whether an arbitrary hash is empty.  Instead, use the behaviour
of an empty \f(CW%hash\fR always returning false in scalar context.
.PP
\fIClearing stashes\fR
.IX Subsection "Clearing stashes"
.PP
Stash list assignment \f(CW\*(C`%foo:: = ()\*(C'\fR used to make the stash temporarily 
anonymous while it was being emptied.  Consequently, any of its
subroutines referenced elsewhere would become anonymous,  showing up as
\&\*(L"(unknown)\*(R" in \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR.  They now retain their package names such that
\&\f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR returns the original sub name if there is still a reference

.PP
\fIDereferencing typeglobs\fR
.IX Subsection "Dereferencing typeglobs"
.PP
If you assign a typeglob to a scalar variable:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $glob = *foo;
.Ve
.PP
the glob that is copied to \f(CW$glob\fR is marked with a special flag
indicating that the glob is just a copy.  This allows subsequent
assignments to \f(CW$glob\fR to overwrite the glob.  The original glob,
however, is immutable.
.PP
Some Perl operators did not distinguish between these two types of globs.
This would result in strange behaviour in edge cases: \f(CW\*(C`untie $scalar\*(C'\fR
would not untie the scalar if the last thing assigned to it was a glob
(because it treated it as \f(CW\*(C`untie *$scalar\*(C'\fR, which unties a handle).
Assignment to a glob slot (such as \f(CW\*(C`*$glob = \e@some_array\*(C'\fR) would simply
assign \f(CW\*(C`\e@some_array\*(C'\fR to \f(CW$glob\fR.
.PP
To fix this, the \f(CW\*(C`*{}\*(C'\fR operator (including its \f(CW*foo\fR and \f(CW*$foo\fR forms)
has been modified to make a new immutable glob if its operand is a glob
copy.  This allows operators that make a distinction between globs and
scalars to be modified to treat only immutable globs as globs.  (\f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`untie\*(C'\fR have been left as they are for compatibility's sake,
but will warn.  See \*(L"Deprecations\*(R".)
.PP
This causes an incompatible change in code that assigns a glob to the
return value of \f(CW\*(C`*{}\*(C'\fR when that operator was passed a glob copy.  Take the
following code, for instance:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $glob = *foo;
\&    *$glob = *bar;
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW*$glob\fR on the second line returns a new immutable glob.  That new
glob is made an alias to \f(CW*bar\fR.  Then it is discarded.  So the second
assignment has no effect.

\fIMagic variables outside the main package\fR
.IX Subsection "Magic variables outside the main package"
.PP
In previous versions of Perl, magic variables like \f(CW$!\fR, \f(CW%SIG\fR, etc. would
\&\*(L"leak\*(R" into other packages.  So \f(CW%foo::SIG\fR could be used to access signals,
\&\f(CW\*(C`${"foo::!"}\*(C'\fR (with strict mode off) to access C's \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR, etc.
.PP
This was a bug, or an \*(L"unintentional\*(R" feature, which caused various ill effects,
such as signal handlers being wiped when modules were loaded, etc.
.PP
This has been fixed (or the feature has been removed, depending on how you see
it).
.PP
\fIlocal($_) strips all magic from \f(CI$_\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "local($_) strips all magic from $_"
.PP
\&\fIlocal()\fR on scalar variables gives them a new value but keeps all
their magic intact.  This has proven problematic for the default
scalar variable \f(CW$_\fR, where perlsub recommends that any subroutine
that assigns to \f(CW$_\fR should first localize it.  This would throw an
exception if \f(CW$_\fR is aliased to a read-only variable, and could in general have
various unintentional side-effects.

\fINegation treats strings differently from before\fR

The unary negation operator, \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR, now treats strings that look like numbers
as numbers [perl #57706].
.PP
\fINegative zero\fR
.IX Subsection "Negative zero"
.PP
Negative zero (\-0.0), when converted to a string, now becomes \*(L"0\*(R" on all
platforms.  It used to become \*(L"\-0\*(R" on some, but \*(L"0\*(R" on others.
.PP

\fI\f(CI\*(C`:=\*(C'\fI is now a syntax error\fR
.IX Subsection ":= is now a syntax error"
.PP
Previously \f(CW\*(C`my $pi := 4\*(C'\fR was exactly equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`my $pi : = 4\*(C'\fR,
with the \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR being treated as the start of an attribute list, ending before
the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR.  The use of \f(CW\*(C`:=\*(C'\fR to mean \f(CW\*(C`: =\*(C'\fR was deprecated in 5.12.0, and is
now a syntax error.  This allows future use of \f(CW\*(C`:=\*(C'\fR as a new token.
.PP
Outside the core's tests for it, we find no Perl 5 code on \s-1CPAN\s0
using this construction, so we believe that this change will have
little impact on real-world codebases.
.PP
If it is absolutely necessary to have empty attribute lists (for example,
because of a code generator), simply avoid the error by adding a space before
the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIChange in the parsing of identifiers\fR
.IX Subsection "Change in the parsing of identifiers"
.PP
Characters outside the Unicode \*(L"XIDStart\*(R" set are no longer allowed at the

that normally follow an alphabetic character may no longer be the first
character of an identifier.

.PP
On systems other than Windows that do not have

longer inherit directory handles from their parent threads.  Such programs
would usually have crashed anyway [perl #75154].
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`close\*(C'\fI on shared pipes\fR
.IX Subsection "close on shared pipes"
.PP
To avoid deadlocks, the \f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR function no longer waits for the
child process to exit if the underlying file descriptor is still
in use by another thread.  It returns true in such cases.
.PP
\fI\fIfork()\fI emulation will not wait for signalled children\fR
.IX Subsection "fork() emulation will not wait for signalled children"
.PP
On Windows parent processes would not terminate until all forked
children had terminated first.  However, \f(CW\*(C`kill("KILL", ...)\*(C'\fR is
inherently unstable on pseudo-processes, and \f(CW\*(C`kill("TERM", ...)\*(C'\fR
might not get delivered if the child is blocked in a system call.
.PP
To avoid the deadlock and still provide a safe mechanism to terminate
the hosting process, Perl now no longer waits for children that
have been sent a \s-1SIGTERM\s0 signal.  It is up to the parent process to
\&\fIwaitpid()\fR for these children if child-cleanup processing must be
allowed to finish.  However, it is also then the responsibility of the
parent to avoid the deadlock by making sure the child process
can't be blocked on I/O.

\fIPerl source code is read in text mode on Windows\fR
.IX Subsection "Perl source code is read in text mode on Windows"
.PP
Perl scripts used to be read in binary mode on Windows for the benefit
of the ByteLoader module (which is no longer part of core Perl).  This
had the side-effect of breaking various operations on the \f(CW\*(C`DATA\*(C'\fR filehandle,
including \fIseek()\fR/\fItell()\fR, and even simply reading from \f(CW\*(C`DATA\*(C'\fR after filehandles
have been flushed by a call to \fIsystem()\fR, backticks, \fIfork()\fR etc.
.PP
The default build options for Windows have been changed to read Perl source
code on Windows in text mode now.  ByteLoader will (hopefully) be updated on
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 to automatically handle this situation [perl #28106].

Omitting the space between a regular expression operator or
its modifiers and the following word is deprecated.  For
example, \f(CW\*(C`m/foo/sand $bar\*(C'\fR is for now still parsed

The backslash-c construct was designed as a way of specifying
non-printable characters, but there were no restrictions (on \s-1ASCII\s0
platforms) on what the character following the \f(CW\*(C`c\*(C'\fR could be.  Now,
a deprecation warning is raised if that character isn't an \s-1ASCII\s0 character.
Also, a deprecation warning is raised for \f(CW"\ec{"\fR (which is the same

.IX Subsection """b{"" and ""B{"""
In regular expressions, a literal \f(CW"{"\fR immediately following a \f(CW"\eb"\fR
(not in a bracketed character class) or a \f(CW"\eB{"\fR is now deprecated
to allow for its future use by Perl itself.
.SS "Perl 4\-era .pl libraries"
.IX Subsection "Perl 4-era .pl libraries"
Perl bundles a handful of library files that predate Perl 5.
This bundling is now deprecated for most of these files, which are now
available from \s-1CPAN\s0.  The affected files now warn when run, if they were
installed as part of the core.
.PP
This is a mandatory warning, not obeying \fB\-X\fR or lexical warning bits.
The warning is modelled on that supplied by \fIdeprecate.pm\fR for
deprecated-in-core \fI.pm\fR libraries.  It points to the specific \s-1CPAN\s0
distribution that contains the \fI.pl\fR libraries.  The \s-1CPAN\s0 versions, of
course, do not generate the warning.
.ie n .SS "List assignment to $["
.el .SS "List assignment to \f(CW$[\fP"
.IX Subsection "List assignment to $["
Assignment to \f(CW$[\fR was deprecated and started to give warnings in
Perl version 5.12.0.  This version of Perl (5.14) now also emits a warning 
when assigning to \f(CW$[\fR in list context.  This fixes an oversight in 5.12.0.
.SS "Use of qw(...) as parentheses"
.IX Subsection "Use of qw(...) as parentheses"
Historically the parser fooled itself into thinking that \f(CW\*(C`qw(...)\*(C'\fR literals
were always enclosed in parentheses, and as a result you could sometimes omit
parentheses around them:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    for $x qw(a b c) { ... }
.Ve
.PP
The parser no longer lies to itself in this way.  Wrap the list literal in
parentheses like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    for $x (qw(a b c)) { ... }
.Ve
.PP
This is being deprecated because the parentheses in \f(CW\*(C`for $i (1,2,3) { ... }\*(C'\fR
are not part of expression syntax.  They are part of the statement
syntax, with the \f(CW\*(C`for\*(C'\fR statement wanting literal parentheses.
The synthetic parentheses that a \f(CW\*(C`qw\*(C'\fR expression acquired were only
intended to be treated as part of expression syntax.
.PP
Note that this does not change the behaviour of cases like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use POSIX qw(setlocale localeconv);
\&    our @EXPORT = qw(foo bar baz);
.Ve
.PP
where parentheses were never required around the expression.

Calling a tie function (\f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`tied\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`untie\*(C'\fR) with a scalar argument
acts on a filehandle if the scalar happens to hold a typeglob.
.PP
This is a long-standing bug that will be removed in Perl 5.16, as
there is currently no way to tie the scalar itself when it holds
a typeglob, and no way to untie a scalar that has had a typeglob
assigned to it.
.PP
Now there is a deprecation warning whenever a tie
function is used on a handle without an explicit \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR.
.SS "User-defined case-mapping"
.IX Subsection "User-defined case-mapping"
This feature is being deprecated due to its many issues, as documented in
\&\*(L"User-Defined Case Mappings (for serious hackers only)\*(R" in perlunicode.
This feature will be removed in Perl 5.16.  Instead use the \s-1CPAN\s0 module
Unicode::Casing, which provides improved functionality.
.SS "Deprecated modules"
.IX Subsection "Deprecated modules"
The following module will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and should be installed from \s-1CPAN\s0 instead.  Distributions
on \s-1CPAN\s0 that require this should add it to their prerequisites.  The
core version of these module now issues a deprecation warning.
.PP
If you ship a packaged version of Perl, either alone or as part of a
larger system, then you should carefully consider the repercussions of
core module deprecations.  You may want to consider shipping your default
build of Perl with a package for the deprecated module that
installs into \f(CW\*(C`vendor\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`site\*(C'\fR Perl library directories.  This will
inhibit the deprecation warnings.
.PP
Alternatively, you may want to consider patching \fIlib/deprecate.pm\fR
to provide deprecation warnings specific to your packaging system
or distribution of Perl, consistent with how your packaging system
or distribution manages a staged transition from a release where the
installation of a single package provides the given functionality, to
a later release where the system administrator needs to know to install
multiple packages to get that same functionality.
.PP
You can silence these deprecation warnings by installing the module
in question from \s-1CPAN\s0.  To install the latest version of it by role
rather than by name, just install \f(CW\*(C`Task::Deprecations::5_14\*(C'\fR.
.IP "Devel::DProf" 4

Signal dispatch has been moved from the runloop into control ops.
This should give a few percent speed increase, and eliminates nearly

.SS "Optimisation of \fIshift()\fP and \fIpop()\fP calls without arguments"
.IX Subsection "Optimisation of shift() and pop() calls without arguments"
Two fewer OPs are used for \fIshift()\fR and \fIpop()\fR calls with no argument (with
implicit \f(CW@_\fR).  This change makes \fIshift()\fR 5% faster than \f(CW\*(C`shift @_\*(C'\fR

When doing a lot of string appending, perls built to use the system's

inefficient way.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`sv_grow\*(C'\fR, the function used to allocate more memory if necessary
when appending to a string, has been taught to round up the memory
it requests to a certain geometric progression, making it much faster on

faster.

When \f(CW\*(C`MULTIPLICITY\*(C'\fR was first developed, and interpreter state moved into
an interpreter struct, thread\- and interpreter-local \f(CW\*(C`PL_*\*(C'\fR variables
were defined as macros that called accessor functions (returning the
address of the value) outside the Perl core.  The intent was to allow
members within the interpreter struct to change size without breaking
binary compatibility, so that bug fixes could be merged to a maintenance
branch that necessitated such a size change.  This mechanism was redundant
and penalised well-behaved code.  It has been removed.
.SS "Freeing weak references"

When there are many weak references to an object, freeing that object

An earlier optimisation to speed up \f(CW\*(C`my @array = ...\*(C'\fR and

Now we have found another way to speed up these assignments [perl #82110].
.ie n .SS "@_ uses less memory"
.el .SS "\f(CW@_\fP uses less memory"

Previously, \f(CW@_\fR was allocated for every subroutine at compile time with

.SS "Size optimisations to \s-1SV\s0 and \s-1HV\s0 structures"
.IX Subsection "Size optimisations to SV and HV structures"
\&\f(CW\*(C`xhv_fill\*(C'\fR has been eliminated from \f(CW\*(C`struct xpvhv\*(C'\fR, saving 1 \s-1IV\s0 per hash and
on some systems will cause \f(CW\*(C`struct xpvhv\*(C'\fR to become cache-aligned.  To avoid
this memory saving causing a slowdown elsewhere, boolean use of \f(CW\*(C`HvFILL\*(C'\fR
now calls \f(CW\*(C`HvTOTALKEYS\*(C'\fR instead (which is equivalent), so while the fill
data when actually required are now calculated on demand, cases when
this needs to be done should be rare.
.PP
The order of structure elements in \s-1SV\s0 bodies has changed.  Effectively,
the \s-1NV\s0 slot has swapped location with \s-1STASH\s0 and \s-1MAGIC\s0.  As all access to
\&\s-1SV\s0 members is via macros, this should be completely transparent.  This
change allows the space saving for PVHVs documented above, and may reduce
the memory allocation needed for PVIVs on some architectures.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`XPV\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`XPVIV\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`XPVNV\*(C'\fR now allocate only the parts of the \f(CW\*(C`SV\*(C'\fR body

.SS "Memory savings for weak references"

For weak references, the common case of just a single weak reference

The internal structures of threading now make fewer \s-1API\s0 calls and fewer

the ops for \f(CW\*(C`warn if DEBUG\*(C'\fR would be folded to a \f(CW\*(C`null\*(C'\fR op (\f(CW\*(C`ex\-const\*(C'\fR), but

.PP
The execution of a sequence of \f(CW\*(C`nextstate\*(C'\fR ops is indistinguishable from just
the last \f(CW\*(C`nextstate\*(C'\fR op so the peephole optimizer now eliminates the first of
a pair of \f(CW\*(C`nextstate\*(C'\fR ops except when the first carries a label, since labels

The \f(CW\*(C`no 5.13.2\*(C'\fR or similar form is now correctly handled by B::Deparse
(5.12.3).
.Sp
B::Deparse now properly handles the code that applies a conditional
pattern match against implicit \f(CW$_\fR as it was fixed in [perl #20444].
.Sp
Deparsing of \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR followed by a variable with funny characters

Carp has been upgraded from version 1.15 to 1.20.
.Sp
Carp now detects incomplete \fIcaller()\fR
overrides and avoids using bogus \f(CW@DB::args\fR.  To provide backtraces,
Carp relies on particular behaviour of the \fIcaller()\fR builtin.
Carp now detects if other code has overridden this with an
incomplete implementation, and modifies its backtrace accordingly.
Previously incomplete overrides would cause incorrect values in
backtraces (best case), or obscure fatal errors (worst case).
.Sp
This fixes certain cases of \*(L"Bizarre copy of \s-1ARRAY\s0\*(R" caused by modules
overriding \fIcaller()\fR incorrectly (5.12.2).
.Sp
It now also avoids using regular expressions that cause Perl to
load its Unicode tables, so as to avoid the \*(L"\s-1BEGIN\s0 not safe after
errors\*(R" error that ensue if there has been a syntax error
[perl #82854].
.IP "\(bu" 4

Extension building on older (pre 7.3\-2) \s-1VMS\s0 systems was broken because
configure.com hit the \s-1DCL\s0 symbol length limit of 1K.  We now work within
this limit when assembling the list of extensions in the core build (5.12.1).

\&\f(CW\*(C`PerlIOUnix_open\*(C'\fR now honours the default permissions on \s-1VMS\s0.
.Sp
When \f(CW\*(C`perlio\*(C'\fR became the default and \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR became the default bottom layer,
the most common path for creating files from Perl became \f(CW\*(C`PerlIOUnix_open\*(C'\fR,
which has always explicitly used \f(CW0666\fR as the permission mask.  This prevents
inheriting permissions from \s-1RMS\s0 defaults and ACLs, so to avoid that problem,
we now pass \f(CW0777\fR to \fIopen()\fR.  In the \s-1VMS\s0 \s-1CRTL\s0, \f(CW0777\fR has a special
meaning over and above intersecting with the current umask; specifically, it
allows Unix syscalls to preserve native default permissions (5.12.3).
.IP "\(bu" 4
The shortening of symbols longer than 31 characters in the core C sources
and in extensions is now by default done by the C compiler rather than by
xsubpp (which could only do so for generated symbols in \s-1XS\s0 code).  You can
reenable xsubpp's symbol shortening by configuring with \-Uuseshortenedsymbols,
but you'll have some work to do to get the core sources to compile.

\fICustom per-subroutine check hooks\fR
.IX Subsection "Custom per-subroutine check hooks"
.PP
\&\s-1XS\s0 code in an extension module can now annotate a subroutine (whether
implemented in \s-1XS\s0 or in Perl) so that nominated \s-1XS\s0 code will be called
at compile time (specifically as part of op checking) to change the op
tree of that subroutine.  The compile-time check function (supplied by
the extension module) can implement argument processing that can't be
expressed as a prototype, generate customised compile-time warnings,
perform constant folding for a pure function, inline a subroutine
consisting of sufficiently simple ops, replace the whole call with a
custom op, and so on.  This was previously all possible by hooking the
\&\f(CW\*(C`entersub\*(C'\fR op checker, but the new mechanism makes it easy to tie the
hook to a specific subroutine.  See \*(L"cv_set_call_checker\*(R" in perlapi.
.PP
To help in writing custom check hooks, several subtasks within standard
\&\f(CW\*(C`entersub\*(C'\fR op checking have been separated out and exposed in the \s-1API\s0.

.PP
Custom ops can now be registered with the new \f(CW\*(C`custom_op_register\*(C'\fR C

properties of custom ops in the future.  Two new properties have been added
already, \f(CW\*(C`xop_class\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`xop_peep\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`xop_class\*(C'\fR is one of the OA_*OP constants.  It allows B and other
introspection mechanisms to work with custom ops
that aren't BASEOPs.  \f(CW\*(C`xop_peep\*(C'\fR is a pointer to
a function that will be called for ops of this
type from \f(CW\*(C`Perl_rpeep\*(C'\fR.

They allow extension authors to find and remove magic attached to
scalars based on both the magic type and the magic virtual table, similar to how
\&\fIsv_magicext()\fR attaches magic of a certain type and with a given virtual table

\fICheck \s-1API\s0 compatibility when loading \s-1XS\s0 modules\fR
.IX Subsection "Check API compatibility when loading XS modules"
.PP
When Perl's \s-1API\s0 changes in incompatible ways (which usually happens between
major releases), \s-1XS\s0 modules compiled for previous versions of Perl will no
longer work.  They need to be recompiled against the new Perl.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`XS_APIVERSION_BOOTCHECK\*(C'\fR macro has been added to ensure that modules
are recompiled and to prevent users from accidentally loading modules
compiled for old perls into newer perls.  That macro, which is called when
loading every newly compiled extension, compares the \s-1API\s0 version of the
running perl with the version a module has been compiled for and raises an
exception if they don't match.

The first argument of the C \s-1API\s0 function \f(CW\*(C`Perl_fetch_cop_label\*(C'\fR has changed
from \f(CW\*(C`struct refcounted_he *\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`COP *\*(C'\fR, to insulate the user from
implementation details.
.PP
This \s-1API\s0 function was marked as \*(L"may change\*(R", and likely isn't in use outside

.PP
The new \fIGvCV_set()\fR and \fIGvGP_set()\fR macros are now provided to replace
assignment to those two macros.
.PP
This allows a future commit to eliminate some backref magic between \s-1GV\s0

Under some circumstances, the \fICvGV()\fR field of a \s-1CV\s0 is now
reference-counted.  To ensure consistent behaviour, direct assignment to
it, for example \f(CW\*(C`CvGV(cv) = gv\*(C'\fR is now a compile-time error.  A new macro,
\&\f(CW\*(C`CvGV_set(cv,gv)\*(C'\fR has been introduced to run this operation

.PP
Some of the flags parameters to \fIuvuni_to_utf8_flags()\fR and
\&\fIutf8n_to_uvuni()\fR have changed.  This is a result of Perl's now allowing
internal storage and manipulation of code points that are problematic
in some situations.  Hence, the default actions for these functions has
been complemented to allow these code points.  The new flags are
documented in perlapi.  Code that requires the problematic code
points to be rejected needs to change to use the new flags.  Some flag
names are retained for backward source compatibility, though they do
nothing, as they are now the default.  However the flags

Opening a glob reference via \f(CW\*(C`open($fh, ">", \e*glob)\*(C'\fR no longer

There have been several fixes to PerlIO layers:
.Sp
When \f(CW\*(C`binmode(FH, ":crlf")\*(C'\fR pushes the \f(CW\*(C`:crlf\*(C'\fR layer on top of the stack,
it no longer enables crlf layers lower in the stack so as to avoid

Opening a file in \f(CW\*(C`:raw\*(C'\fR mode now does what it advertises to do (first
open the file, then \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR it), instead of simply leaving off the top

The three layers \f(CW\*(C`:pop\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`:bytes\*(C'\fR didn't allow stacking when

The regular expression bracketed character class \f(CW\*(C`[\e8\e9]\*(C'\fR was effectively the

incorrect warnings that the \f(CW8\fR and \f(CW9\fR were ignored.  Now \f(CW\*(C`[\e8\e9]\*(C'\fR is the

unrecognized escape sequences, passed-through.

A regular expression match in the right-hand side of a global substitution

Several cases in which characters in the Latin\-1 non-ASCII range (0x80 to

The trie optimisation was not taking empty groups into account, preventing

A pattern containing a \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR inside a lookahead would sometimes cause an

A regular expression optimisation would sometimes cause a match with a

.IP "\(bu" 4
Case-insensitive matching in regular expressions compiled under
\&\f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR now works much more sanely when the pattern or target
string is internally encoded in \s-1UTF8\s0.  Previously, under these
conditions the localeness was completely lost.  Now, code points
above 255 are treated as Unicode, but code points between 0 and 255
are treated using the current locale rules, regardless of whether
the pattern or the string is encoded in \s-1UTF8\s0.  The few case-insensitive
matches that cross the 255/256 boundary are not allowed.  For
example, 0xFF does not caselessly match the character at 0x178,
\&\s-1LATIN\s0 \s-1CAPITAL\s0 \s-1LETTER\s0 Y \s-1WITH\s0 \s-1DIAERESIS\s0, because 0xFF may not be \s-1LATIN\s0
\&\s-1SMALL\s0 \s-1LETTER\s0 Y in the current locale, and Perl has no way of knowing
if that character even exists in the locale, much less what code
point it is.

The \f(CW\*(C`(?|...)\*(C'\fR regular expression construct no longer crashes if the final

not take multiple branches into account [perl #84746].
.IP "\(bu" 4
A bug has been fixed in the implementation of \f(CW\*(C`{...}\*(C'\fR quantifiers in

When strict \*(L"refs\*(R" mode is off, \f(CW\*(C`%{...}\*(C'\fR in rvalue context returns

5.12.0 to make \f(CW\*(C`keys %{...}\*(C'\fR faster when used as a boolean did not take
this into account, causing \f(CW\*(C`keys %{+undef}\*(C'\fR (and \f(CW\*(C`keys %$foo\*(C'\fR when

.PP
In addition, various other bugs related to typeglobs and stashes have been
fixed:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Some work has been done on the internal pointers that link between symbol
tables (stashes), typeglobs, and subroutines.  This has the effect that
various edge cases related to deleting stashes or stash entries (for example,
<%FOO:: = ()>), and complex typeglob or code-reference aliasing, will no
longer crash the interpreter.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning a reference to a glob copy now assigns to a glob slot instead of
overwriting the glob with a scalar [perl #1804] [perl #77508].
.IP "\(bu" 4
A bug when replacing the glob of a loop variable within the loop has been fixed
[perl #21469].  This
means the following code will no longer crash:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    for $x (...) {
\&        *x = *y;
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assigning a glob to a \s-1PVLV\s0 used to convert it to a plain string.  Now it
works correctly, and a \s-1PVLV\s0 can hold a glob.  This would happen when a
nonexistent hash or array element was passed to a subroutine:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  sub { $_[0] = *foo }\->($hash{key});
\&  # $_[0] would have been the string "*main::foo"
.Ve
.Sp
It also happened when a glob was assigned to, or returned from, an element
of a tied array or hash [perl #36051].
.IP "\(bu" 4
When trying to report \f(CW\*(C`Use of uninitialized value $Foo::BAR\*(C'\fR, crashes could
occur if the glob holding the global variable in question had been detached
from its original stash by, for example, \f(CW\*(C`delete $::{"Foo::"}\*(C'\fR.  This has
been fixed by disabling the reporting of variable names in those
cases.
.IP "\(bu" 4
During the restoration of a localised typeglob on scope exit, any
destructors called as a result would be able to see the typeglob in an
inconsistent state, containing freed entries, which could result in a
crash.  This would affect code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  local *@;
\&  eval { die bless [] }; # puts an object in $@
\&  sub DESTROY {
\&    local $@; # boom
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
Now the glob entries are cleared before any destructors are called.  This
also means that destructors can vivify entries in the glob.  So Perl tries
again and, if the entries are re-created too many times, dies with a
\&\*(L"panic: gp_free ...\*(R" error message.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If a typeglob is freed while a subroutine attached to it is still
referenced elsewhere, the subroutine is renamed to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_ANON_\|_\*(C'\fR in the same
package, unless the package has been undefined, in which case the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_ANON_\|_\*(C'\fR
package is used.  This could cause packages to be sometimes autovivified,
such as if the package had been deleted.  Now this no longer occurs.
The \f(CW\*(C`_\|_ANON_\|_\*(C'\fR package is also now used when the original package is
no longer attached to the symbol table.  This avoids memory leaks in some
cases [perl #87664].

Handling of Unicode non-character code points has changed.
Previously they were mostly considered illegal, except that in some

This is part of the change to allow internal use of any code

Case-insensitive \f(CW"/i"\fR regular expression matching of Unicode

.Ve
.Sp
and
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& "ffi" =~ /\eN{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI}/ui
.Ve
.Sp
are both true.  Previously, there were many bugs with this feature.
What hasn't been fixed are the places where the pattern contains the
multiple characters, but the characters are split up by other things,
such as in
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& "\eN{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI}" =~ /(f)(f)i/ui
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Sp
None of these match.
.Sp
Also, this matching doesn't fully conform to the current Unicode
Standard, which asks that the matching be made upon the \s-1NFD\s0
(Normalization Form Decomposed) of the text.  However, as of this
writing (April 2010), the Unicode Standard is currently in flux about
what they will recommend doing with regard in such scenarios.  It may be
that they will throw out the whole concept of multi-character matches.

Non-commutative binary operators used to swap their operands if the same
tied scalar was used for both operands and returned a different value for
each \s-1FETCH\s0.  For instance, if \f(CW$t\fR returned 2 the first time and 3 the
second, then \f(CW\*(C`$t/$t\*(C'\fR would evaluate to 1.5.  This has been fixed
[perl #87708].
.IP "\(bu" 4
String \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR now detects taintedness of overloaded or tied
arguments [perl #75716].
.IP "\(bu" 4
String \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR and regular expression matches against objects with string
overloading no longer cause memory corruption or crashes [perl #77084].
.IP "\(bu" 4
readline now honors \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR overloading on tied
arguments.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`<expr>\*(C'\fR always respects overloading now if the expression is
overloaded.
.Sp
Because \*(L"<>\ as glob\*(R" was parsed differently from
\&\*(L"<>\ as filehandle\*(R" from 5.6 onwards, something like \f(CW\*(C`<$foo[0]>\*(C'\fR did
not handle overloading, even if \f(CW$foo[0]\fR was an overloaded object.  This
was contrary to the documentation for overload, and meant that \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR
could not be used as a general overloaded iterator operator.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The fallback behaviour of overloading on binary operators was asymmetric
[perl #71286].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Magic applied to variables in the main package no longer affects other packages.
See \*(L"Magic variables outside the main package\*(R" above [perl #76138].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Sometimes magic (ties, taintedness, etc.) attached to variables could cause
an object to last longer than it should, or cause a crash if a tied
variable were freed from within a tie method.  These have been fixed
[perl #81230].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1DESTROY\s0 methods of objects implementing ties are no longer able to crash by
accessing the tied variable through a weak reference [perl #86328].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fixed a regression of \fIkill()\fR when a match variable is used for the
process \s-1ID\s0 to kill [perl #75812].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$AUTOLOAD\fR used to remain tainted forever if it ever became tainted.  Now
it is correctly untainted if an autoloaded method is called and the method
name was not tainted.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR now dies when passed a tainted scalar for the format.  It did
already die for arbitrary expressions, but not for simple scalars
[perl #82250].

\&\f(CW\*(C`lc\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`uc\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`lcfirst\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`ucfirst\*(C'\fR no longer return untainted strings
when the argument is tainted.  This has been broken since perl 5.8.9
[perl #87336].

The Perl debugger now also works in taint mode [perl #76872].

Subroutine redefinition works once more in the debugger [perl #48332].
.IP "\(bu" 4
When \fB\-d\fR is used on the shebang (\f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR) line, the debugger now has access
to the lines of the main program.  In the past, this sometimes worked and
sometimes did not, depending on the order in which things happened to be
arranged in memory [perl #71806].
.IP "\(bu" 4
A possible memory leak when using \fIcaller()\fR to set
\&\f(CW@DB::args\fR has been fixed (5.12.2).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl no longer stomps on \f(CW$DB::single\fR, \f(CW$DB::trace\fR, and \f(CW$DB::signal\fR 
if these variables already have values when \f(CW$^P\fR is assigned to [perl #72422].

\&\f(CW\*(C`#line\*(C'\fR directives in string evals were not properly updating the arrays
of lines of code (\f(CW\*(C`@{"_< ..."}\*(C'\fR) that the debugger (or any debugging or
profiling module) uses.  In threaded builds, they were not being updated at
all.  In non-threaded builds, the line number was ignored, so any change to
the existing line number would cause the lines to be misnumbered
[perl #79442].
.SS "Threads"
.IX Subsection "Threads"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl no longer accidentally clones lexicals in scope within active stack
frames in the parent when creating a child thread [perl #73086].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Several memory leaks in cloning and freeing threaded Perl interpreters have been
fixed [perl #77352].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Creating a new thread when directory handles were open used to cause a
crash, because the handles were not cloned, but simply passed to the new
thread, resulting in a double free.
.Sp
Now directory handles are cloned properly on Windows
and on systems that have a \f(CW\*(C`fchdir\*(C'\fR function.  On other
systems, new threads simply do not inherit directory
handles from their parent threads [perl #75154].
.IP "\(bu" 4
The typeglob \f(CW\*(C`*,\*(C'\fR, which holds the scalar variable \f(CW$,\fR (output field
separator), had the wrong reference count in child threads.
.IP "\(bu" 4
[perl #78494] When pipes are shared between threads, the \f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR function
(and any implicit close, such as on thread exit) no longer blocks.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl now does a timely cleanup of SVs that are cloned into a new
thread but then discovered to be orphaned (that is, their owners
are \fInot\fR cloned).  This eliminates several \*(L"scalars leaked\*(R"
warnings when joining threads.
.SS "Scoping and Subroutines"

Lvalue subroutines are again able to return copy-on-write scalars.  This
had been broken since version 5.10.0 [perl #75656] (5.12.3).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR no longer causes \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR to return the wrong file name for

same file name [perl #68712].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR with a \f(CW\*(C`($$)\*(C'\fR\-prototyped comparison routine used to cause the value
of \f(CW@_\fR to leak out of the sort.  Taking a reference to \f(CW@_\fR within the
sorting routine could cause a crash [perl #72334].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Match variables (like \f(CW$1\fR) no longer persist between calls to a sort
subroutine [perl #76026].

closure) now results in a \*(L"Closure prototype called\*(R" error message instead
of a crash [perl #68560].

they were blocked before by \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::sigprocmask\*(C'\fR [perl #82040].
.IP "\(bu" 4
A signal handler called within a signal handler could cause leaks or
double-frees.  Now fixed [perl #76248].
.SS "Miscellaneous Memory Leaks"

.IP "\(bu" 4
Several memory leaks when loading \s-1XS\s0 modules were fixed (5.12.2).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIsubstr()\fR,
\&\fIpos()\fR, \fIkeys()\fR,

.IP "\(bu" 4
The postincrement and postdecrement operators, \f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR, used to cause

When assigning a list with duplicated keys to a hash, the assignment used to
return garbage and/or freed values:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @a = %h = (list with some duplicate keys);
.Ve
.Sp
This has now been fixed [perl #31865].
.IP "\(bu" 4
The mechanism for freeing objects in globs used to leave dangling
pointers to freed SVs, meaning Perl users could see corrupted state
during destruction.
.Sp
Perl now frees only the affected slots of the \s-1GV\s0, rather than freeing
the \s-1GV\s0 itself.  This makes sure that there are no dangling refs or
corrupted state during destruction.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The interpreter no longer crashes when freeing deeply-nested arrays of
arrays.  Hashes have not been fixed yet [perl #44225].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Concatenating long strings under \f(CW\*(C`use encoding\*(C'\fR no longer causes Perl to
crash [perl #78674].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Calling \f(CW\*(C`\->import\*(C'\fR on a class lacking an import method could corrupt
the stack, resulting in strange behaviour.  For instance,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  push @a, "foo", $b = bar\->import;
.Ve
.Sp
would assign \*(L"foo\*(R" to \f(CW$b\fR [perl #63790].
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`recv\*(C'\fR function could crash when called with the \s-1MSG_TRUNC\s0 flag
[perl #75082].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`formline\*(C'\fR no longer crashes when passed a tainted format picture.  It also
taints \f(CW$^A\fR now if its arguments are tainted [perl #79138].
.IP "\(bu" 4
A bug in how we process filetest operations could cause a segfault.
Filetests don't always expect an op on the stack, so we now use
TOPs only if we're sure that we're not \f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fRing the \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR filehandle.
This is indicated by \f(CW\*(C`OPf_KIDS\*(C'\fR (as checked in ck_ftst) [perl #74542]
(5.12.1).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIunpack()\fR now handles scalar context correctly for \f(CW%32H\fR and \f(CW%32u\fR,
fixing a potential crash.  \fIsplit()\fR would crash because the third item
on the stack wasn't the regular expression it expected.  \f(CW\*(C`unpack("%2H",
\&...)\*(C'\fR would return both the unpacked result and the checksum on the stack,

Stringifying a scalar containing \*(L"\-0.0\*(R" no longer has the effect of turning
false into true [perl #45133].

Some numeric operators were converting integers to floating point,
resulting in loss of precision on 64\-bit platforms [perl #77456].
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIsprintf()\fR was ignoring locales when called with constant arguments
[perl #78632].
.IP "\(bu" 4
Combining the vector (\f(CW%v\fR) flag and dynamic precision would
cause \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR to confuse the order of its arguments, making it 
treat the string as the precision and vice-versa [perl #83194].

.IP "\(bu" 4
The C\-level \f(CW\*(C`lex_stuff_pvn\*(C'\fR function would sometimes cause a spurious
syntax error on the last line of the file if it lacked a final semicolon
[perl #74006] (5.12.1).
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`eval_sv\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eval_pv\*(C'\fR C functions now set \f(CW$@\fR correctly when
there is a syntax error and no \f(CW\*(C`G_KEEPERR\*(C'\fR flag, and never set it if the

.IP "\(bu" 4
The \s-1XS\s0 multicall \s-1API\s0 no longer causes subroutines to lose reference counts
if called via the multicall interface from within those very subroutines.
This affects modules like List::Util.  Calling one of its functions with an
active subroutine as the first argument could cause a crash [perl #78070].
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`SvPVbyte\*(C'\fR function available to \s-1XS\s0 modules now calls magic before
downgrading the \s-1SV\s0, to avoid warnings about wide characters [perl #72398].

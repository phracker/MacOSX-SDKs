perlreapi \- perl regular expression plugin interface
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
As of Perl 5.9.5 there is a new interface for plugging and using other
regular expression engines than the default one.
.PP
Each engine is supposed to provide access to a constant structure of the
following format:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    typedef struct regexp_engine {
\&        REGEXP* (*comp) (pTHX_ const SV * const pattern, const U32 flags);

.Ve
.PP
When a regexp is compiled, its \f(CW\*(C`engine\*(C'\fR field is then set to point at
the appropriate structure, so that when it needs to be used Perl can find
the right routines to do so.
.PP
In order to install a new regexp handler, \f(CW$^H{regcomp}\fR is set
to an integer which (when casted appropriately) resolves to one of these
structures. When compiling, the \f(CW\*(C`comp\*(C'\fR method is executed, and the
resulting regexp structure's engine field is expected to point back at
the same structure.
.PP
The pTHX_ symbol in the definition is a macro used by perl under threading
to provide an extra argument to the routine holding a pointer back to
the interpreter that is executing the regexp. So under threading all
routines get an extra argument.
.SH "Callbacks"
.IX Header "Callbacks"
.SS "comp"
.IX Subsection "comp"
.Vb 1
\&    REGEXP* comp(pTHX_ const SV * const pattern, const U32 flags);
.Ve
.PP
Compile the pattern stored in \f(CW\*(C`pattern\*(C'\fR using the given \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR and
return a pointer to a prepared \f(CW\*(C`REGEXP\*(C'\fR structure that can perform
the match. See \*(L"The \s-1REGEXP\s0 structure\*(R" below for an explanation of
the individual fields in the \s-1REGEXP\s0 struct.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`pattern\*(C'\fR parameter is the scalar that was used as the
pattern. previous versions of perl would pass two \f(CW\*(C`char*\*(C'\fR indicating
the start and end of the stringified pattern, the following snippet can
be used to get the old parameters:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    STRLEN plen;
\&    char*  exp = SvPV(pattern, plen);
\&    char* xend = exp + plen;
.Ve
.PP
Since any scalar can be passed as a pattern it's possible to implement
an engine that does something with an array (\f(CW\*(C`"ook" =~ [ qw/ eek
hlagh / ]\*(C'\fR) or with the non-stringified form of a compiled regular
expression (\f(CW\*(C`"ook" =~ qr/eek/\*(C'\fR). perl's own engine will always
stringify everything using the snippet above but that doesn't mean
other engines have to.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR parameter is a bitfield which indicates which of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`msixp\*(C'\fR flags the regex was compiled with. It also contains
additional info such as whether \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR is in effect.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`eogc\*(C'\fR flags are stripped out before being passed to the comp
routine. The regex engine does not need to know whether any of these
are set as those flags should only affect what perl does with the
pattern and its match variables, not how it gets compiled and
executed.
.PP
By the time the comp callback is called, some of these flags have
already had effect (noted below where applicable). However most of
their effect occurs after the comp callback has run in routines that
read the \f(CW\*(C`rx\->extflags\*(C'\fR field which it populates.
.PP
In general the flags should be preserved in \f(CW\*(C`rx\->extflags\*(C'\fR after
compilation, although the regex engine might want to add or delete
some of them to invoke or disable some special behavior in perl. The
flags along with any special behavior they cause are documented below:
.PP
The pattern modifiers:
.ie n .IP """/m"" \- RXf_PMf_MULTILINE" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/m\fR \- RXf_PMf_MULTILINE" 4
.IX Item "/m - RXf_PMf_MULTILINE"
If this is in \f(CW\*(C`rx\->extflags\*(C'\fR it will be passed to
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_fbm_instr\*(C'\fR by \f(CW\*(C`pp_split\*(C'\fR which will treat the subject string
as a multi-line string.
.ie n .IP """/s"" \- RXf_PMf_SINGLELINE" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/s\fR \- RXf_PMf_SINGLELINE" 4
.IX Item "/s - RXf_PMf_SINGLELINE"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP """/i"" \- RXf_PMf_FOLD" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/i\fR \- RXf_PMf_FOLD" 4

.ie n .IP """/x"" \- RXf_PMf_EXTENDED" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/x\fR \- RXf_PMf_EXTENDED" 4
.IX Item "/x - RXf_PMf_EXTENDED"
.PD
If present on a regex \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR comments will be handled differently by the
tokenizer in some cases.
.Sp
\&\s-1TODO:\s0 Document those cases.
.ie n .IP """/p"" \- RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/p\fR \- RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY" 4
.IX Item "/p - RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY"
\&\s-1TODO:\s0 Document this
.IP "Character set" 4
.IX Item "Character set"
The character set semantics are determined by an enum that is contained
in this field.  This is still experimental and subject to change, but
the current interface returns the rules by use of the in-line function
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_regex_charset(const U32 flags)\*(C'\fR.  The only currently documented
value returned from it is \s-1REGEX_LOCALE_CHARSET\s0, which is set if
\&\f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR is in effect. If present in \f(CW\*(C`rx\->extflags\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR will use the locale dependent definition of whitespace
when RXf_SKIPWHITE or RXf_WHITE is in effect. \s-1ASCII\s0 whitespace
is defined as per isSPACE, and by the internal
macros \f(CW\*(C`is_utf8_space\*(C'\fR under \s-1UTF\-8\s0, and \f(CW\*(C`isSPACE_LC\*(C'\fR under \f(CW\*(C`use
locale\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Additional flags:
.IP "RXf_UTF8" 4
.IX Item "RXf_UTF8"
Set if the pattern is \fISvUTF8()\fR, set by Perl_pmruntime.
.Sp
A regex engine may want to set or disable this flag during
compilation. The perl engine for instance may upgrade non\-UTF\-8
strings to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 if the pattern includes constructs such as \f(CW\*(C`\ex{...}\*(C'\fR
that can only match Unicode values.
.IP "RXf_SPLIT" 4
.IX Item "RXf_SPLIT"
If \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR is invoked as \f(CW\*(C`split \*(Aq \*(Aq\*(C'\fR or with no arguments (which
really means \f(CW\*(C`split(\*(Aq \*(Aq, $_)\*(C'\fR, see split), perl will
set this flag. The regex engine can then check for it and set the
\&\s-1SKIPWHITE\s0 and \s-1WHITE\s0 extflags. To do this the perl engine does:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    if (flags & RXf_SPLIT && r\->prelen == 1 && r\->precomp[0] == \*(Aq \*(Aq)
\&        r\->extflags |= (RXf_SKIPWHITE|RXf_WHITE);
.Ve
.PP
These flags can be set during compilation to enable optimizations in
the \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR operator.
.IP "RXf_SKIPWHITE" 4
.IX Item "RXf_SKIPWHITE"
If the flag is present in \f(CW\*(C`rx\->extflags\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR will delete
whitespace from the start of the subject string before it's operated
on. What is considered whitespace depends on whether the subject is a
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 string and whether the \f(CW\*(C`RXf_PMf_LOCALE\*(C'\fR flag is set.
.Sp
If RXf_WHITE is set in addition to this flag \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR will behave like
\&\f(CW\*(C`split " "\*(C'\fR under the perl engine.
.IP "RXf_START_ONLY" 4
.IX Item "RXf_START_ONLY"
Tells the split operator to split the target string on newlines
(\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR) without invoking the regex engine.
.Sp
Perl's engine sets this if the pattern is \f(CW\*(C`/^/\*(C'\fR (\f(CW\*(C`plen == 1 && *exp
== \*(Aq^\*(Aq\*(C'\fR), even under \f(CW\*(C`/^/s\*(C'\fR, see split. Of course a
different regex engine might want to use the same optimizations
with a different syntax.
.IP "RXf_WHITE" 4
.IX Item "RXf_WHITE"
Tells the split operator to split the target string on whitespace
without invoking the regex engine. The definition of whitespace varies
depending on whether the target string is a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 string and on
whether RXf_PMf_LOCALE is set.
.Sp
Perl's engine sets this flag if the pattern is \f(CW\*(C`\es+\*(C'\fR.
.IP "RXf_NULL" 4
.IX Item "RXf_NULL"
Tells the split operator to split the target string on
characters. The definition of character varies depending on whether
the target string is a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 string.
.Sp
Perl's engine sets this flag on empty patterns, this optimization
makes \f(CW\*(C`split //\*(C'\fR much faster than it would otherwise be. It's even
faster than \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR.

Called by perl when it is freeing a regexp pattern so that the engine
can release any resources pointed to by the \f(CW\*(C`pprivate\*(C'\fR member of the
regexp structure. This is only responsible for freeing private data;
perl will handle releasing anything else contained in the regexp structure.
.SS "Numbered capture callbacks"
.IX Subsection "Numbered capture callbacks"
Called to get/set the value of \f(CW\*(C`$\`\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`$\*(Aq\*(C'\fR, \f(CW$&\fR and their named
equivalents, ${^PREMATCH}, ${^POSTMATCH} and $^{\s-1MATCH\s0}, as well as the
numbered capture groups (\f(CW$1\fR, \f(CW$2\fR, ...).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`paren\*(C'\fR parameter will be \f(CW\*(C`\-2\*(C'\fR for \f(CW\*(C`$\`\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR for \f(CW\*(C`$\*(Aq\*(C'\fR, \f(CW0\fR
for \f(CW$&\fR, \f(CW1\fR for \f(CW$1\fR and so forth.
.PP
The names have been chosen by analogy with Tie::Scalar methods
names with an additional \fB\s-1LENGTH\s0\fR callback for efficiency. However
named capture variables are currently not tied internally but
implemented via magic.
.PP
\fInumbered_buff_FETCH\fR
.IX Subsection "numbered_buff_FETCH"
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    void numbered_buff_FETCH(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const I32 paren,
\&                             SV * const sv);
.Ve
.PP
Fetch a specified numbered capture. \f(CW\*(C`sv\*(C'\fR should be set to the scalar
to return, the scalar is passed as an argument rather than being
returned from the function because when it's called perl already has a
scalar to store the value, creating another one would be
redundant. The scalar can be set with \f(CW\*(C`sv_setsv\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sv_setpvn\*(C'\fR and
friends, see perlapi.
.PP
This callback is where perl untaints its own capture variables under
taint mode (see perlsec). See the \f(CW\*(C`Perl_reg_numbered_buff_fetch\*(C'\fR
function in \fIregcomp.c\fR for how to untaint capture variables if
that's something you'd like your engine to do as well.
.PP

\&                                    SV const * const value);
.Ve
.PP
Set the value of a numbered capture variable. \f(CW\*(C`value\*(C'\fR is the scalar
that is to be used as the new value. It's up to the engine to make
sure this is used as the new value (or reject it).
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    if ("ook" =~ /(o*)/) {
\&        # \*(Aqparen\*(Aq will be \*(Aq1\*(Aq and \*(Aqvalue\*(Aq will be \*(Aqee\*(Aq
\&        $1 =~ tr/o/e/;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Perl's own engine will croak on any attempt to modify the capture
variables, to do this in another engine use the following callback
(copied from \f(CW\*(C`Perl_reg_numbered_buff_store\*(C'\fR):
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    void
\&    Example_reg_numbered_buff_store(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const I32 paren,
\&                                                            SV const * const value)
\&    {
\&        PERL_UNUSED_ARG(rx);
\&        PERL_UNUSED_ARG(paren);
\&        PERL_UNUSED_ARG(value);
\&
\&        if (!PL_localizing)
\&            Perl_croak(aTHX_ PL_no_modify);
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Actually perl will not \fIalways\fR croak in a statement that looks
like it would modify a numbered capture variable. This is because the
\&\s-1STORE\s0 callback will not be called if perl can determine that it
doesn't have to modify the value. This is exactly how tied variables
behave in the same situation:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package CaptureVar;
\&    use base \*(AqTie::Scalar\*(Aq;
\&
\&    sub TIESCALAR { bless [] }
\&    sub FETCH { undef }
\&    sub STORE { die "This doesn\*(Aqt get called" }
\&
\&    package main;
\&
\&    tie my $sv => "CaptureVar";
\&    $sv =~ y/a/b/;
.Ve
.PP
Because \f(CW$sv\fR is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR when the \f(CW\*(C`y///\*(C'\fR operator is applied to it
the transliteration won't actually execute and the program won't
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR. This is different to how 5.8 and earlier versions behaved
since the capture variables were \s-1READONLY\s0 variables then, now they'll
just die when assigned to in the default engine.
.PP
\fInumbered_buff_LENGTH\fR
.IX Subsection "numbered_buff_LENGTH"
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    I32 numbered_buff_LENGTH (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const SV * const sv,
\&                              const I32 paren);
.Ve
.PP
Get the \f(CW\*(C`length\*(C'\fR of a capture variable. There's a special callback
for this so that perl doesn't have to do a \s-1FETCH\s0 and run \f(CW\*(C`length\*(C'\fR on
the result, since the length is (in perl's case) known from an offset
stored in \f(CW\*(C`rx\->offs\*(C'\fR this is much more efficient:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    I32 s1  = rx\->offs[paren].start;
\&    I32 s2  = rx\->offs[paren].end;
\&    I32 len = t1 \- s1;
.Ve
.PP
This is a little bit more complex in the case of \s-1UTF\-8\s0, see what
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_reg_numbered_buff_length\*(C'\fR does with
is_utf8_string_loclen.

(would need an extension to mgvtbl).

On threaded builds a regexp may need to be duplicated so that the pattern
can be used by multiple threads. This routine is expected to handle the
duplication of any private data pointed to by the \f(CW\*(C`pprivate\*(C'\fR member of
the regexp structure.  It will be called with the preconstructed new
regexp structure as an argument, the \f(CW\*(C`pprivate\*(C'\fR member will point at
the \fBold\fR private structure, and it is this routine's responsibility to
construct a copy and return a pointer to it (which perl will then use to
overwrite the field as passed to this routine.)
.PP
This allows the engine to dupe its private data but also if necessary
modify the final structure if it really must.
.PP
On unthreaded builds this field doesn't exist.
.SH "The REGEXP structure"
.IX Header "The REGEXP structure"
The \s-1REGEXP\s0 struct is defined in \fIregexp.h\fR. All regex engines must be able to
correctly build such a structure in their \*(L"comp\*(R" routine.
.PP
The \s-1REGEXP\s0 structure contains all the data that perl needs to be aware of
to properly work with the regular expression. It includes data about
optimisations that perl can use to determine if the regex engine should
really be used, and various other control info that is needed to properly
execute patterns in various contexts such as is the pattern anchored in
some way, or what flags were used during the compile, or whether the
program contains special constructs that perl needs to be aware of.
.PP
In addition it contains two fields that are intended for the private
use of the regex engine that compiled the pattern. These are the
\&\f(CW\*(C`intflags\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`pprivate\*(C'\fR members. \f(CW\*(C`pprivate\*(C'\fR is a void pointer to
an arbitrary structure whose use and management is the responsibility
of the compiling engine. perl will never modify either of these
values.

The fields are discussed in more detail below:
.ie n .SS """engine"""
.el .SS "\f(CWengine\fP"
.IX Subsection "engine"
This field points at a regexp_engine structure which contains pointers
to the subroutines that are to be used for performing a match. It
is the compiling routine's responsibility to populate this field before
returning the regexp object.
.PP
Internally this is set to \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR unless a custom engine is specified in
\&\f(CW$^H{regcomp}\fR, perl's own set of callbacks can be accessed in the struct
pointed to by \f(CW\*(C`RE_ENGINE_PTR\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS """mother_re"""
.el .SS "\f(CWmother_re\fP"
.IX Subsection "mother_re"
\&\s-1TODO\s0, see http://www.mail\-archive.com/perl5\-changes@perl.org/msg17328.html <http://www.mail-archive.com/perl5-changes@perl.org/msg17328.html>
.ie n .SS """extflags"""
.el .SS "\f(CWextflags\fP"
.IX Subsection "extflags"
This will be used by perl to see what flags the regexp was compiled
with, this will normally be set to the value of the flags parameter by
the comp callback. See the comp documentation for
valid flags.
.ie n .SS """minlen"" ""minlenret"""
.el .SS "\f(CWminlen\fP \f(CWminlenret\fP"
.IX Subsection "minlen minlenret"
The minimum string length required for the pattern to match.  This is used to
prune the search space by not bothering to match any closer to the end of a
string than would allow a match. For instance there is no point in even
starting the regex engine if the minlen is 10 but the string is only 5
characters long. There is no way that the pattern can match.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`minlenret\*(C'\fR is the minimum length of the string that would be found
in $& after a match.
.PP
The difference between \f(CW\*(C`minlen\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`minlenret\*(C'\fR can be seen in the
following pattern:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    /ns(?=\ed)/
.Ve
.PP
where the \f(CW\*(C`minlen\*(C'\fR would be 3 but \f(CW\*(C`minlenret\*(C'\fR would only be 2 as the \ed is
required to match but is not actually included in the matched content. This
distinction is particularly important as the substitution logic uses the
\&\f(CW\*(C`minlenret\*(C'\fR to tell whether it can do in-place substitution which can result in
considerable speedup.
.ie n .SS """gofs"""
.el .SS "\f(CWgofs\fP"
.IX Subsection "gofs"
Left offset from \fIpos()\fR to start match at.
.ie n .SS """substrs"""
.el .SS "\f(CWsubstrs\fP"
.IX Subsection "substrs"
Substring data about strings that must appear in the final match. This
is currently only used internally by perl's engine for but might be
used in the future for all engines for optimisations.
.ie n .SS """nparens"", ""lastparen"", and ""lastcloseparen"""
.el .SS "\f(CWnparens\fP, \f(CWlastparen\fP, and \f(CWlastcloseparen\fP"
.IX Subsection "nparens, lastparen, and lastcloseparen"
These fields are used to keep track of how many paren groups could be matched
in the pattern, which was the last open paren to be entered, and which was
the last close paren to be entered.
.ie n .SS """intflags"""
.el .SS "\f(CWintflags\fP"
.IX Subsection "intflags"
The engine's private copy of the flags the pattern was compiled with. Usually
this is the same as \f(CW\*(C`extflags\*(C'\fR unless the engine chose to modify one of them.
.ie n .SS """pprivate"""
.el .SS "\f(CWpprivate\fP"
.IX Subsection "pprivate"
A void* pointing to an engine-defined data structure. The perl engine uses the
\&\f(CW\*(C`regexp_internal\*(C'\fR structure (see \*(L"Base Structures\*(R" in perlreguts) but a custom
engine should use something else.
.ie n .SS """swap"""
.el .SS "\f(CWswap\fP"
.IX Subsection "swap"
Unused. Left in for compatibility with perl 5.10.0.
.ie n .SS """offs"""
.el .SS "\f(CWoffs\fP"
.IX Subsection "offs"
A \f(CW\*(C`regexp_paren_pair\*(C'\fR structure which defines offsets into the string being
matched which correspond to the \f(CW$&\fR and \f(CW$1\fR, \f(CW$2\fR etc. captures, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`regexp_paren_pair\*(C'\fR struct is defined as follows:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    typedef struct regexp_paren_pair {
\&        I32 start;
\&        I32 end;
\&    } regexp_paren_pair;

.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`\->offs[num].start\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\->offs[num].end\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR then that
capture group did not match. \f(CW\*(C`\->offs[0].start/end\*(C'\fR represents \f(CW$&\fR (or
\&\f(CW\*(C`${^MATCH\*(C'\fR under \f(CW\*(C`//p\*(C'\fR) and \f(CW\*(C`\->offs[paren].end\*(C'\fR matches \f(CW$$paren\fR where
\&\f(CW$paren \fR= 1>.
.ie n .SS """precomp"" ""prelen"""
.el .SS "\f(CWprecomp\fP \f(CWprelen\fP"
.IX Subsection "precomp prelen"
Used for optimisations. \f(CW\*(C`precomp\*(C'\fR holds a copy of the pattern that
was compiled and \f(CW\*(C`prelen\*(C'\fR its length. When a new pattern is to be
compiled (such as inside a loop) the internal \f(CW\*(C`regcomp\*(C'\fR operator
checks whether the last compiled \f(CW\*(C`REGEXP\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`precomp\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`prelen\*(C'\fR
are equivalent to the new one, and if so uses the old pattern instead
of compiling a new one.
.PP
The relevant snippet from \f(CW\*(C`Perl_pp_regcomp\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        if (!re || !re\->precomp || re\->prelen != (I32)len ||
\&            memNE(re\->precomp, t, len))
\&        /* Compile a new pattern */
.Ve
.ie n .SS """paren_names"""
.el .SS "\f(CWparen_names\fP"
.IX Subsection "paren_names"
This is a hash used internally to track named capture groups and their
offsets. The keys are the names of the buffers the values are dualvars,
with the \s-1IV\s0 slot holding the number of buffers with the given name and the
pv being an embedded array of I32.  The values may also be contained
independently in the data array in cases where named backreferences are
used.
.ie n .SS """substrs"""
.el .SS "\f(CWsubstrs\fP"
.IX Subsection "substrs"
Holds information on the longest string that must occur at a fixed
offset from the start of the pattern, and the longest string that must
occur at a floating offset from the start of the pattern. Used to do
Fast-Boyer-Moore searches on the string to find out if its worth using
the regex engine at all, and if so where in the string to search.
.ie n .SS """subbeg"" ""sublen"" ""saved_copy"""
.el .SS "\f(CWsubbeg\fP \f(CWsublen\fP \f(CWsaved_copy\fP"
.IX Subsection "subbeg sublen saved_copy"
Used during execution phase for managing search and replace patterns.
.ie n .SS """wrapped"" ""wraplen"""
.el .SS "\f(CWwrapped\fP \f(CWwraplen\fP"
.IX Subsection "wrapped wraplen"
Stores the string \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR stringifies to. The perl engine for example
stores \f(CW\*(C`(?^:eek)\*(C'\fR in the case of \f(CW\*(C`qr/eek/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
When using a custom engine that doesn't support the \f(CW\*(C`(?:)\*(C'\fR construct
for inline modifiers, it's probably best to have \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR stringify to
the supplied pattern, note that this will create undesired patterns in
cases such as:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $x = qr/a|b/;  # "a|b"
\&    my $y = qr/c/i;   # "c"
\&    my $z = qr/$x$y/; # "a|bc"
.Ve
.PP
There's no solution for this problem other than making the custom
engine understand a construct like \f(CW\*(C`(?:)\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS """seen_evals"""
.el .SS "\f(CWseen_evals\fP"
.IX Subsection "seen_evals"
This stores the number of eval groups in the pattern. This is used for security
purposes when embedding compiled regexes into larger patterns with \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS """refcnt"""
.el .SS "\f(CWrefcnt\fP"
.IX Subsection "refcnt"
The number of times the structure is referenced. When this falls to 0 the
regexp is automatically freed by a call to pregfree. This should be set to 1 in
each engine's \*(L"comp\*(R" routine.

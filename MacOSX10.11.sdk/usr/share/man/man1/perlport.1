.SH "NAME"
perlport \- Writing portable Perl
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Perl runs on numerous operating systems.  While most of them share
much in common, they also have their own unique features.
.PP
This document is meant to help you to find out what constitutes portable
Perl code.  That way once you make a decision to write portably,
you know where the lines are drawn, and you can stay within them.
.PP
There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of one particular
type of computer and taking advantage of a full range of them.
Naturally, as you broaden your range and become more diverse, the
common factors drop, and you are left with an increasingly smaller
area of common ground in which you can operate to accomplish a
particular task.  Thus, when you begin attacking a problem, it is
important to consider under which part of the tradeoff curve you
want to operate.  Specifically, you must decide whether it is
important that the task that you are coding have the full generality
of being portable, or whether to just get the job done right now.
This is the hardest choice to be made.  The rest is easy, because
Perl provides many choices, whichever way you want to approach your
problem.
.PP
Looking at it another way, writing portable code is usually about
willfully limiting your available choices.  Naturally, it takes
discipline and sacrifice to do that.  The product of portability
and convenience may be a constant.  You have been warned.
.PP
Be aware of two important points:
.IP "Not all Perl programs have to be portable" 4
.IX Item "Not all Perl programs have to be portable"
There is no reason you should not use Perl as a language to glue Unix
tools together, or to prototype a Macintosh application, or to manage the
Windows registry.  If it makes no sense to aim for portability for one
reason or another in a given program, then don't bother.
.IP "Nearly all of Perl already \fIis\fR portable" 4
.IX Item "Nearly all of Perl already is portable"
Don't be fooled into thinking that it is hard to create portable Perl
code.  It isn't.  Perl tries its level-best to bridge the gaps between
what's available on different platforms, and all the means available to
use those features.  Thus almost all Perl code runs on any machine
without modification.  But there are some significant issues in
writing portable code, and this document is entirely about those issues.
.PP
Here's the general rule: When you approach a task commonly done
using a whole range of platforms, think about writing portable
code.  That way, you don't sacrifice much by way of the implementation
choices you can avail yourself of, and at the same time you can give
your users lots of platform choices.  On the other hand, when you have to
take advantage of some unique feature of a particular platform, as is
often the case with systems programming (whether for Unix, Windows,
\&\s-1VMS,\s0 etc.), consider writing platform-specific code.
.PP
When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, you
may need to consider only the differences of those particular systems.
The important thing is to decide where the code will run and to be
deliberate in your decision.
.PP
The material below is separated into three main sections: main issues of
portability (\*(L"\s-1ISSUES\*(R"\s0), platform-specific issues (\*(L"\s-1PLATFORMS\*(R"\s0), and
built-in perl functions that behave differently on various ports
(\*(L"\s-1FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS\*(R"\s0).
.PP
This information should not be considered complete; it includes possibly
transient information about idiosyncrasies of some of the ports, almost
all of which are in a state of constant evolution.  Thus, this material
should be considered a perpetual work in progress
(\f(CW\*(C`<IMG SRC="yellow_sign.gif" ALT="Under Construction">\*(C'\fR).
.SH "ISSUES"
.IX Header "ISSUES"
.SS "Newlines"
.IX Subsection "Newlines"
In most operating systems, lines in files are terminated by newlines.
Just what is used as a newline may vary from \s-1OS\s0 to \s-1OS. \s0 Unix
traditionally uses \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR, one type of DOSish I/O uses \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR,
and Mac\ \s-1OS\s0 uses \f(CW\*(C`\e015\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Perl uses \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR to represent the \*(L"logical\*(R" newline, where what is
logical may depend on the platform in use.  In MacPerl, \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR always
means \f(CW\*(C`\e015\*(C'\fR.  In DOSish perls, \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR usually means \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR, but when
accessing a file in \*(L"text\*(R" mode, perl uses the \f(CW\*(C`:crlf\*(C'\fR layer that
translates it to (or from) \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR, depending on whether you're
reading or writing. Unix does the same thing on ttys in canonical
mode.  \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR is commonly referred to as \s-1CRLF.\s0
.PP
To trim trailing newlines from text lines use \fIchomp()\fR.  With default 
settings that function looks for a trailing \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR character and thus 
trims in a portable way.
.PP
When dealing with binary files (or text files in binary mode) be sure
to explicitly set $/ to the appropriate value for your file format
before using \fIchomp()\fR.
.PP
Because of the \*(L"text\*(R" mode translation, DOSish perls have limitations
in using \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR on a file accessed in \*(L"text\*(R" mode.
Stick to \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR\-ing to locations you got from \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR (and no
others), and you are usually free to use \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR even
in \*(L"text\*(R" mode.  Using \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR or other file operations
may be non-portable.  If you use \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR on a file, however, you
can usually \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR with arbitrary values in safety.
.PP
A common misconception in socket programming is that \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR eq \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR
everywhere.  When using protocols such as common Internet protocols,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\e015\*(C'\fR are called for specifically, and the values of
the logical \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR (carriage return) are not reliable.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    print SOCKET "Hi there, client!\er\en";      # WRONG
\&    print SOCKET "Hi there, client!\e015\e012";  # RIGHT
.Ve
.PP
However, using \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`\ecM\ecJ\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`\ex0D\ex0A\*(C'\fR) can be tedious
and unsightly, as well as confusing to those maintaining the code.  As
such, the Socket module supplies the Right Thing for those who want it.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
\&    print SOCKET "Hi there, client!$CRLF"      # RIGHT
.Ve
.PP
When reading from a socket, remember that the default input record
separator \f(CW$/\fR is \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR, but robust socket code will recognize as
either \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR as end of line:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    while (<SOCKET>) {
\&        # ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Because both \s-1CRLF\s0 and \s-1LF\s0 end in \s-1LF,\s0 the input record separator can
be set to \s-1LF\s0 and any \s-1CR\s0 stripped later.  Better to write:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
\&    local($/) = LF;      # not needed if $/ is already \e012
\&
\&    while (<SOCKET>) {
\&        s/$CR?$LF/\en/;   # not sure if socket uses LF or CRLF, OK
\&    #   s/\e015?\e012/\en/; # same thing
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
This example is preferred over the previous one\*(--even for Unix
platforms\*(--because now any \f(CW\*(C`\e015\*(C'\fR's (\f(CW\*(C`\ecM\*(C'\fR's) are stripped out
(and there was much rejoicing).
.PP
Similarly, functions that return text data\*(--such as a function that
fetches a web page\*(--should sometimes translate newlines before
returning the data, if they've not yet been translated to the local
newline representation.  A single line of code will often suffice:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $data =~ s/\e015?\e012/\en/g;
\&    return $data;
.Ve
.PP
Some of this may be confusing.  Here's a handy reference to the \s-1ASCII CR\s0
and \s-1LF\s0 characters.  You can print it out and stick it in your wallet.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    LF  eq  \e012  eq  \ex0A  eq  \ecJ  eq  chr(10)  eq  ASCII 10
\&    CR  eq  \e015  eq  \ex0D  eq  \ecM  eq  chr(13)  eq  ASCII 13

\&        \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&        * text\-mode STDIO
.Ve
.PP
The Unix column assumes that you are not accessing a serial line
(like a tty) in canonical mode.  If you are, then \s-1CR\s0 on input becomes
\&\*(L"\en\*(R", and \*(L"\en\*(R" on output becomes \s-1CRLF.\s0
.PP
These are just the most common definitions of \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR in Perl.
There may well be others.  For example, on an \s-1EBCDIC\s0 implementation
such as z/OS (\s-1OS/390\s0) or \s-1OS/400 \s0(using the \s-1ILE,\s0 the \s-1PASE\s0 is ASCII-based)
the above material is similar to \*(L"Unix\*(R" but the code numbers change:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    LF  eq  \e025  eq  \ex15  eq  \ecU  eq  chr(21)  eq  CP\-1047 21
\&    LF  eq  \e045  eq  \ex25  eq           chr(37)  eq  CP\-0037 37

.SS "Numbers endianness and Width"
.IX Subsection "Numbers endianness and Width"
Different CPUs store integers and floating point numbers in different
orders (called \fIendianness\fR) and widths (32\-bit and 64\-bit being the
most common today).  This affects your programs when they attempt to transfer
numbers in binary format from one \s-1CPU\s0 architecture to another,
usually either \*(L"live\*(R" via network connection, or by storing the
numbers to secondary storage such as a disk file or tape.
.PP
Conflicting storage orders make utter mess out of the numbers.  If a
little-endian host (Intel, \s-1VAX\s0) stores 0x12345678 (305419896 in
decimal), a big-endian host (Motorola, Sparc, \s-1PA\s0) reads it as
0x78563412 (2018915346 in decimal).  Alpha and \s-1MIPS\s0 can be either:
Digital/Compaq used/uses them in little-endian mode; SGI/Cray uses
them in big-endian mode.  To avoid this problem in network (socket)
connections use the \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR formats \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR, the
\&\*(L"network\*(R" orders.  These are guaranteed to be portable.
.PP
As of perl 5.10.0, you can also use the \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR modifiers
to force big\- or little-endian byte-order.  This is useful if you want
to store signed integers or 64\-bit integers, for example.
.PP
You can explore the endianness of your platform by unpacking a
data structure packed in native format such as:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    print unpack("h*", pack("s2", 1, 2)), "\en";
\&    # \*(Aq10002000\*(Aq on e.g. Intel x86 or Alpha 21064 in little\-endian mode
\&    # \*(Aq00100020\*(Aq on e.g. Motorola 68040
.Ve
.PP
If you need to distinguish between endian architectures you could use
either of the variables set like so:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $is_big_endian   = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /01/;
\&    $is_little_endian = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /^1/;
.Ve
.PP
Differing widths can cause truncation even between platforms of equal
endianness.  The platform of shorter width loses the upper parts of the
number.  There is no good solution for this problem except to avoid
transferring or storing raw binary numbers.
.PP
One can circumnavigate both these problems in two ways.  Either
transfer and store numbers always in text format, instead of raw
binary, or else consider using modules like Data::Dumper and Storable
(included as of perl 5.8).  Keeping all data as text significantly
simplifies matters.
.PP
The v\-strings are portable only up to v2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF), that's
how far \s-1EBCDIC,\s0 or more precisely UTF-EBCDIC will go.
.SS "Files and Filesystems"
.IX Subsection "Files and Filesystems"
Most platforms these days structure files in a hierarchical fashion.
So, it is reasonably safe to assume that all platforms support the
notion of a \*(L"path\*(R" to uniquely identify a file on the system.  How
that path is really written, though, differs considerably.
.PP
Although similar, file path specifications differ between Unix,
Windows, Mac\ \s-1OS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, RISC\s0\ \s-1OS,\s0 and probably others.
Unix, for example, is one of the few OSes that has the elegant idea
of a single root directory.
.PP
\&\s-1DOS, OS/2, VMS, VOS,\s0 and Windows can work similarly to Unix with \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR
as path separator, or in their own idiosyncratic ways (such as having
several root directories and various \*(L"unrooted\*(R" device files such \s-1NIL:\s0
and \s-1LPT:\s0).
.PP
Mac\ \s-1OS 9\s0 and earlier used \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR as a path separator instead of \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The filesystem may support neither hard links (\f(CW\*(C`link\*(C'\fR) nor
symbolic links (\f(CW\*(C`symlink\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`readlink\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`lstat\*(C'\fR).
.PP
The filesystem may support neither access timestamp nor change
timestamp (meaning that about the only portable timestamp is the
modification timestamp), or one second granularity of any timestamps
(e.g. the \s-1FAT\s0 filesystem limits the time granularity to two seconds).
.PP
The \*(L"inode change timestamp\*(R" (the \f(CW\*(C`\-C\*(C'\fR filetest) may really be the
\&\*(L"creation timestamp\*(R" (which it is not in Unix).
.PP
\&\s-1VOS\s0 perl can emulate Unix filenames with \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR as path separator.  The
native pathname characters greater-than, less-than, number-sign, and
percent-sign are always accepted.
.PP
\&\s-1RISC\s0\ \s-1OS\s0 perl can emulate Unix filenames with \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR as path
separator, or go native and use \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR for path separator and \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR to
signal filesystems and disk names.
.PP
Don't assume Unix filesystem access semantics: that read, write,
and execute are all the permissions there are, and even if they exist,
that their semantics (for example what do r, w, and x mean on
a directory) are the Unix ones.  The various Unix/POSIX compatibility
layers usually try to make interfaces like \fIchmod()\fR work, but sometimes
there simply is no good mapping.
.PP
If all this is intimidating, have no (well, maybe only a little)
fear.  There are modules that can help.  The File::Spec modules
provide methods to do the Right Thing on whatever platform happens
to be running the program.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    use File::Spec::Functions;
\&    chdir(updir());        # go up one directory
\&    my $file = catfile(curdir(), \*(Aqtemp\*(Aq, \*(Aqfile.txt\*(Aq);
\&    # on Unix and Win32, \*(Aq./temp/file.txt\*(Aq
\&    # on Mac OS Classic, \*(Aq:temp:file.txt\*(Aq
\&    # on VMS, \*(Aq[.temp]file.txt\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
File::Spec is available in the standard distribution as of version
5.004_05.  File::Spec::Functions is only in File::Spec 0.7 and later,
and some versions of perl come with version 0.6.  If File::Spec
is not updated to 0.7 or later, you must use the object-oriented
interface from File::Spec (or upgrade File::Spec).
.PP
In general, production code should not have file paths hardcoded.
Making them user-supplied or read from a configuration file is
better, keeping in mind that file path syntax varies on different
machines.
.PP
This is especially noticeable in scripts like Makefiles and test suites,
which often assume \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR as a path separator for subdirectories.
.PP
Also of use is File::Basename from the standard distribution, which
splits a pathname into pieces (base filename, full path to directory,
and file suffix).
.PP
Even when on a single platform (if you can call Unix a single platform),
remember not to count on the existence or the contents of particular
system-specific files or directories, like \fI/etc/passwd\fR,
\&\fI/etc/sendmail.conf\fR, \fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR, or even \fI/tmp/\fR.  For
example, \fI/etc/passwd\fR may exist but not contain the encrypted
passwords, because the system is using some form of enhanced security.
Or it may not contain all the accounts, because the system is using \s-1NIS. \s0
If code does need to rely on such a file, include a description of the
file and its format in the code's documentation, then make it easy for
the user to override the default location of the file.
.PP
Don't assume a text file will end with a newline.  They should,
but people forget.
.PP
Do not have two files or directories of the same name with different
case, like \fItest.pl\fR and \fITest.pl\fR, as many platforms have
case-insensitive (or at least case-forgiving) filenames.  Also, try
not to have non-word characters (except for \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR) in the names, and
keep them to the 8.3 convention, for maximum portability, onerous a
burden though this may appear.
.PP
Likewise, when using the AutoSplit module, try to keep your functions to
8.3 naming and case-insensitive conventions; or, at the least,
make it so the resulting files have a unique (case-insensitively)
first 8 characters.
.PP
Whitespace in filenames is tolerated on most systems, but not all,
and even on systems where it might be tolerated, some utilities
might become confused by such whitespace.
.PP
Many systems (\s-1DOS, VMS ODS\-2\s0) cannot have more than one \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR in their
filenames.
.PP
Don't assume \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR won't be the first character of a filename.
Always use \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR explicitly to open a file for reading, or even
better, use the three-arg version of open, unless you want the user to
be able to specify a pipe open.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    open my $fh, \*(Aq<\*(Aq, $existing_file) or die $!;
.Ve
.PP
If filenames might use strange characters, it is safest to open it
with \f(CW\*(C`sysopen\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR is magic and can
translate characters like \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR, which may
be the wrong thing to do.  (Sometimes, though, it's the right thing.)
Three-arg open can also help protect against this translation in cases
where it is undesirable.
.PP
Don't use \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR as a part of a filename since many systems use that for
their own semantics (Mac \s-1OS\s0 Classic for separating pathname components,
many networking schemes and utilities for separating the nodename and
the pathname, and so on).  For the same reasons, avoid \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Don't assume that in pathnames you can collapse two leading slashes
\&\f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR into one: some networking and clustering filesystems have special
semantics for that.  Let the operating system to sort it out.

.PP
and the \*(L"\-\*(R" shouldn't be the first character.  If you want to be
hypercorrect, stay case-insensitive and within the 8.3 naming
convention (all the files and directories have to be unique within one
directory if their names are lowercased and truncated to eight
characters before the \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR, if any, and to three characters after the
\&\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR, if any).  (And do not use \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fRs in directory names.)
.SS "System Interaction"
.IX Subsection "System Interaction"
Not all platforms provide a command line.  These are usually platforms
that rely primarily on a Graphical User Interface (\s-1GUI\s0) for user
interaction.  A program requiring a command line interface might
not work everywhere.  This is probably for the user of the program
to deal with, so don't stay up late worrying about it.
.PP
Some platforms can't delete or rename files held open by the system,
this limitation may also apply to changing filesystem metainformation
like file permissions or owners.  Remember to \f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR files when you
are done with them.  Don't \f(CW\*(C`unlink\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`rename\*(C'\fR an open file.  Don't
\&\f(CW\*(C`tie\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR a file already tied or opened; \f(CW\*(C`untie\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR
it first.
.PP
Don't open the same file more than once at a time for writing, as some
operating systems put mandatory locks on such files.
.PP
Don't assume that write/modify permission on a directory gives the
right to add or delete files/directories in that directory.  That is
filesystem specific: in some filesystems you need write/modify
permission also (or even just) in the file/directory itself.  In some
filesystems (\s-1AFS, DFS\s0) the permission to add/delete directory entries
is a completely separate permission.
.PP
Don't assume that a single \f(CW\*(C`unlink\*(C'\fR completely gets rid of the file:
some filesystems (most notably the ones in \s-1VMS\s0) have versioned
filesystems, and \fIunlink()\fR removes only the most recent one (it doesn't
remove all the versions because by default the native tools on those
platforms remove just the most recent version, too).  The portable
idiom to remove all the versions of a file is
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    1 while unlink "file";
.Ve
.PP
This will terminate if the file is undeleteable for some reason
(protected, not there, and so on).
.PP
Don't count on a specific environment variable existing in \f(CW%ENV\fR.
Don't count on \f(CW%ENV\fR entries being case-sensitive, or even
case-preserving.  Don't try to clear \f(CW%ENV\fR by saying \f(CW\*(C`%ENV = ();\*(C'\fR, or,
if you really have to, make it conditional on \f(CW\*(C`$^O ne \*(AqVMS\*(Aq\*(C'\fR since in
\&\s-1VMS\s0 the \f(CW%ENV\fR table is much more than a per-process key-value string
table.
.PP
On \s-1VMS,\s0 some entries in the \f(CW%ENV\fR hash are dynamically created when
their key is used on a read if they did not previously exist.  The
values for \f(CW$ENV{HOME}\fR, \f(CW$ENV{TERM}\fR, \f(CW$ENV{HOME}\fR, and \f(CW$ENV{USER}\fR,
are known to be dynamically generated.  The specific names that are
dynamically generated may vary with the version of the C library on \s-1VMS,\s0
and more may exist than is documented.
.PP
On \s-1VMS\s0 by default, changes to the \f(CW%ENV\fR hash are persistent after the process
exits.  This can cause unintended issues.
.PP
Don't count on signals or \f(CW%SIG\fR for anything.
.PP
Don't count on filename globbing.  Use \f(CW\*(C`opendir\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`closedir\*(C'\fR instead.
.PP
Don't count on per-program environment variables, or per-program current
directories.
.PP
Don't count on specific values of \f(CW$!\fR, neither numeric nor
especially the strings values. Users may switch their locales causing
error messages to be translated into their languages.  If you can
trust a POSIXish environment, you can portably use the symbols defined
by the Errno module, like \s-1ENOENT. \s0 And don't trust on the values of \f(CW$!\fR
at all except immediately after a failed system call.
.SS "Command names versus file pathnames"
.IX Subsection "Command names versus file pathnames"
Don't assume that the name used to invoke a command or program with
\&\f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR can also be used to test for the existence of the
file that holds the executable code for that command or program.
First, many systems have \*(L"internal\*(R" commands that are built-in to the
shell or \s-1OS\s0 and while these commands can be invoked, there is no
corresponding file.  Second, some operating systems (e.g., Cygwin,
\&\s-1DJGPP, OS/2,\s0 and \s-1VOS\s0) have required suffixes for executable files;
these suffixes are generally permitted on the command name but are not
required.  Thus, a command like \*(L"perl\*(R" might exist in a file named
\&\*(L"perl\*(R", \*(L"perl.exe\*(R", or \*(L"perl.pm\*(R", depending on the operating system.
The variable \*(L"_exe\*(R" in the Config module holds the executable suffix,
if any.  Third, the \s-1VMS\s0 port carefully sets up $^X and
\&\f(CW$Config\fR{perlpath} so that no further processing is required.  This is
just as well, because the matching regular expression used below would
then have to deal with a possible trailing version number in the \s-1VMS\s0
file name.
.PP

very useful.

All the above \*(L"don't\*(R":s may look daunting, and they are, but the key

.SS "Interprocess Communication (\s-1IPC\s0)"

In general, don't directly access the system in code meant to be

that makes being a perl hacker worth being.
.PP
Commands that launch external processes are generally supported on
most platforms (though many of them do not support any type of
forking).  The problem with using them arises from what you invoke
them on.  External tools are often named differently on different
platforms, may not be available in the same location, might accept
different arguments, can behave differently, and often present their
results in a platform-dependent way.  Thus, you should seldom depend
on them to produce consistent results. (Then again, if you're calling 
\&\fInetstat \-a\fR, you probably don't expect it to run on both Unix and \s-1CP/M.\s0)
.PP
One especially common bit of Perl code is opening a pipe to \fBsendmail\fR:

.Vb 2
\&    open(MAIL, \*(Aq|/usr/lib/sendmail \-t\*(Aq) 
\&        or die "cannot fork sendmail: $!";
.Ve
.PP
This is fine for systems programming when sendmail is known to be
available.  But it is not fine for many non-Unix systems, and even
some Unix systems that may not have sendmail installed.  If a portable
solution is needed, see the various distributions on \s-1CPAN\s0 that deal
with it.  Mail::Mailer and Mail::Send in the MailTools distribution are
commonly used, and provide several mailing methods, including mail,
sendmail, and direct \s-1SMTP \s0(via Net::SMTP) if a mail transfer agent is
not available.  Mail::Sendmail is a standalone module that provides
simple, platform-independent mailing.
.PP
The Unix System V \s-1IPC \s0(\f(CW\*(C`msg*(), sem*(), shm*()\*(C'\fR) is not available
even on all Unix platforms.

Do not use either the bare result of \f(CW\*(C`pack("N", 10, 20, 30, 40)\*(C'\fR or
bare v\-strings (such as \f(CW\*(C`v10.20.30.40\*(C'\fR) to represent IPv4 addresses:
both forms just pack the four bytes into network order.  That this
would be equal to the C language \f(CW\*(C`in_addr\*(C'\fR struct (which is what the
socket code internally uses) is not guaranteed.  To be portable use
the routines of the Socket extension, such as \f(CW\*(C`inet_aton()\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`inet_ntoa()\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`sockaddr_in()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The rule of thumb for portable code is: Do it all in portable Perl, or
use a module (that may internally implement it with platform-specific
code, but expose a common interface).
.SS "External Subroutines (\s-1XS\s0)"
.IX Subsection "External Subroutines (XS)"
\&\s-1XS\s0 code can usually be made to work with any platform, but dependent
libraries, header files, etc., might not be readily available or
portable, or the \s-1XS\s0 code itself might be platform-specific, just as Perl
code might be.  If the libraries and headers are portable, then it is
normally reasonable to make sure the \s-1XS\s0 code is portable, too.
.PP
A different type of portability issue arises when writing \s-1XS\s0 code:
availability of a C compiler on the end-user's system.  C brings
with it its own portability issues, and writing \s-1XS\s0 code will expose
you to some of those.  Writing purely in Perl is an easier way to
achieve portability.
.SS "Standard Modules"
.IX Subsection "Standard Modules"
In general, the standard modules work across platforms.  Notable
exceptions are the \s-1CPAN\s0 module (which currently makes connections to external
programs that may not be available), platform-specific modules (like
ExtUtils::MM_VMS), and \s-1DBM\s0 modules.
.PP
There is no one \s-1DBM\s0 module available on all platforms.
SDBM_File and the others are generally available on all Unix and DOSish
ports, but not in MacPerl, where only NBDM_File and DB_File are
available.
.PP
The good news is that at least some \s-1DBM\s0 module should be available, and
AnyDBM_File will use whichever module it can find.  Of course, then
the code needs to be fairly strict, dropping to the greatest common
factor (e.g., not exceeding 1K for each record), so that it will
work with any \s-1DBM\s0 module.  See AnyDBM_File for more details.
.SS "Time and Date"
.IX Subsection "Time and Date"
The system's notion of time of day and calendar date is controlled in
widely different ways.  Don't assume the timezone is stored in \f(CW$ENV{TZ}\fR,
and even if it is, don't assume that you can control the timezone through
that variable.  Don't assume anything about the three-letter timezone
abbreviations (for example that \s-1MST\s0 would be the Mountain Standard Time,
it's been known to stand for Moscow Standard Time).  If you need to
use timezones, express them in some unambiguous format like the
exact number of minutes offset from \s-1UTC,\s0 or the \s-1POSIX\s0 timezone
format.
.PP
Don't assume that the epoch starts at 00:00:00, January 1, 1970,
because that is \s-1OS\-\s0 and implementation-specific.  It is better to
store a date in an unambiguous representation.  The \s-1ISO 8601\s0 standard
defines YYYY-MM-DD as the date format, or \s-1YYYY\-MM\-DDTHH:MM:SS
\&\s0(that's a literal \*(L"T\*(R" separating the date from the time).
Please do use the \s-1ISO 8601\s0 instead of making us guess what
date 02/03/04 might be.  \s-1ISO 8601\s0 even sorts nicely as-is.
A text representation (like \*(L"1987\-12\-18\*(R") can be easily converted
into an OS-specific value using a module like Date::Parse.
An array of values, such as those returned by \f(CW\*(C`localtime\*(C'\fR, can be
converted to an OS-specific representation using Time::Local.
.PP
When calculating specific times, such as for tests in time or date modules,
it may be appropriate to calculate an offset for the epoch.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    require Time::Local;
\&    my $offset = Time::Local::timegm(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 70);
.Ve
.PP
The value for \f(CW$offset\fR in Unix will be \f(CW0\fR, but in Mac \s-1OS\s0 Classic
will be some large number.  \f(CW$offset\fR can then be added to a Unix time
value to get what should be the proper value on any system.
.SS "Character sets and character encoding"

Assume very little about character sets.
.PP
Assume nothing about numerical values (\f(CW\*(C`ord\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`chr\*(C'\fR) of characters.
Do not use explicit code point ranges (like \exHH\-\exHH); use for

.PP
Do not assume that the alphabetic characters are encoded contiguously
(in the numeric sense).  There may be gaps.
.PP
Do not assume anything about the ordering of the characters.
The lowercase letters may come before or after the uppercase letters;
the lowercase and uppercase may be interlaced so that both \*(L"a\*(R" and \*(L"A\*(R"
come before \*(L"b\*(R"; the accented and other international characters may
be interlaced so that a\*: comes before \*(L"b\*(R".
.SS "Internationalisation"
.IX Subsection "Internationalisation"
If you may assume \s-1POSIX \s0(a rather large assumption), you may read
more about the \s-1POSIX\s0 locale system from perllocale.  The locale
system at least attempts to make things a little bit more portable,
or at least more convenient and native-friendly for non-English
users.  The system affects character sets and encoding, and date
and time formatting\*(--amongst other things.
.PP
If you really want to be international, you should consider Unicode.
See perluniintro and perlunicode for more information.
.PP
If you want to use non-ASCII bytes (outside the bytes 0x00..0x7f) in
the \*(L"source code\*(R" of your code, to be portable you have to be explicit
about what bytes they are.  Someone might for example be using your
code under a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locale, in which case random native bytes might be
illegal (\*(L"Malformed \s-1UTF\-8 ...\*(R"\s0)  This means that for example embedding
\&\s-1ISO 8859\-1\s0 bytes beyond 0x7f into your strings might cause trouble
later.  If the bytes are native 8\-bit bytes, you can use the \f(CW\*(C`bytes\*(C'\fR
pragma.  If the bytes are in a string (regular expression being a
curious string), you can often also use the \f(CW\*(C`\exHH\*(C'\fR notation instead
of embedding the bytes as-is.  If you want to write your code in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0
you can use the \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR.
.SS "System Resources"
.IX Subsection "System Resources"
If your code is destined for systems with severely constrained (or
missing!) virtual memory systems then you want to be \fIespecially\fR mindful
of avoiding wasteful constructs such as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @lines = <$very_large_file>;            # bad
\&

\&    my $file = join(\*(Aq\*(Aq, <$fh>);                # better
.Ve
.PP
The last two constructs may appear unintuitive to most people.  The
first repeatedly grows a string, whereas the second allocates a
large chunk of memory in one go.  On some systems, the second is
more efficient that the first.
.SS "Security"
.IX Subsection "Security"
Most multi-user platforms provide basic levels of security, usually
implemented at the filesystem level.  Some, however, unfortunately do
not.  Thus the notion of user id, or \*(L"home\*(R" directory,
or even the state of being logged-in, may be unrecognizable on many
platforms.  If you write programs that are security-conscious, it
is usually best to know what type of system you will be running
under so that you can write code explicitly for that platform (or
class of platforms).
.PP
Don't assume the Unix filesystem access semantics: the operating
system or the filesystem may be using some \s-1ACL\s0 systems, which are
richer languages than the usual rwx.  Even if the rwx exist,
their semantics might be different.
.PP
(From security viewpoint testing for permissions before attempting to
do something is silly anyway: if one tries this, there is potential
for race conditions. Someone or something might change the
permissions between the permissions check and the actual operation.
Just try the operation.)
.PP
Don't assume the Unix user and group semantics: especially, don't
expect the \f(CW$<\fR and \f(CW$>\fR (or the \f(CW$(\fR and \f(CW$)\fR) to work
for switching identities (or memberships).
.PP
Don't assume set-uid and set-gid semantics. (And even if you do,
think twice: set-uid and set-gid are a known can of security worms.)
.SS "Style"
.IX Subsection "Style"
For those times when it is necessary to have platform-specific code,
consider keeping the platform-specific code in one place, making porting
to other platforms easier.  Use the Config module and the special
variable \f(CW$^O\fR to differentiate platforms, as described in
\&\*(L"\s-1PLATFORMS\*(R"\s0.
.PP
Be careful in the tests you supply with your module or programs.
Module code may be fully portable, but its tests might not be.  This
often happens when tests spawn off other processes or call external
programs to aid in the testing, or when (as noted above) the tests
assume certain things about the filesystem and paths.  Be careful not
to depend on a specific output style for errors, such as when checking
\&\f(CW$!\fR after a failed system call.  Using \f(CW$!\fR for anything else than
displaying it as output is doubtful (though see the Errno module for
testing reasonably portably for error value). Some platforms expect
a certain output format, and Perl on those platforms may have been
adjusted accordingly.  Most specifically, don't anchor a regex when
testing an error value.

Perl works on a bewildering variety of Unix and Unix-like platforms (see

On most of these systems, the value of \f(CW$^O\fR (hence \f(CW$Config{\*(Aqosname\*(Aq}\fR,
too) is determined either by lowercasing and stripping punctuation from the
first field of the string returned by typing \f(CW\*(C`uname \-a\*(C'\fR (or a similar command)
at the shell prompt or by testing the file system for the presence of
uniquely named files such as a kernel or header file.  Here, for example,

.SS "\s-1DOS\s0 and Derivatives"
.IX Subsection "DOS and Derivatives"
Perl has long been ported to Intel-style microcomputers running under
systems like PC-DOS, MS-DOS, \s-1OS/2,\s0 and most Windows platforms you can
bring yourself to mention (except for Windows \s-1CE,\s0 if you count that).
Users familiar with \fI\s-1COMMAND.COM\s0\fR or \fI\s-1CMD.EXE\s0\fR style shells should
be aware that each of these file specifications may have subtle
differences:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    my $filespec0 = "c:/foo/bar/file.txt";
\&    my $filespec1 = "c:\e\efoo\e\ebar\e\efile.txt";
\&    my $filespec2 = \*(Aqc:\efoo\ebar\efile.txt\*(Aq;
\&    my $filespec3 = \*(Aqc:\e\efoo\e\ebar\e\efile.txt\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
System calls accept either \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR as the path separator.
However, many command-line utilities of \s-1DOS\s0 vintage treat \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR as
the option prefix, so may get confused by filenames containing \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
Aside from calling any external programs, \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR will work just fine,
and probably better, as it is more consistent with popular usage,
and avoids the problem of remembering what to backwhack and what
not to.
.PP
The \s-1DOS FAT\s0 filesystem can accommodate only \*(L"8.3\*(R" style filenames.  Under
the \*(L"case-insensitive, but case-preserving\*(R" \s-1HPFS \s0(\s-1OS/2\s0) and \s-1NTFS \s0(\s-1NT\s0)
filesystems you may have to be careful about case returned with functions
like \f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR or used with functions like \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`opendir\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\s-1DOS\s0 also treats several filenames as special, such as \s-1AUX, PRN,
NUL, CON, COM1, LPT1, LPT2,\s0 etc.  Unfortunately, sometimes these
filenames won't even work if you include an explicit directory
prefix.  It is best to avoid such filenames, if you want your code
to be portable to \s-1DOS\s0 and its derivatives.  It's hard to know what
these all are, unfortunately.
.PP
Users of these operating systems may also wish to make use of
scripts such as \fIpl2bat.bat\fR or \fIpl2cmd\fR to
put wrappers around your scripts.
.PP
Newline (\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR) is translated as \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR by \s-1STDIO\s0 when reading from
and writing to files (see \*(L"Newlines\*(R").  \f(CW\*(C`binmode(FILEHANDLE)\*(C'\fR
will keep \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR translated as \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR for that filehandle.  Since it is a
no-op on other systems, \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR should be used for cross-platform code
that deals with binary data.  That's assuming you realize in advance
that your data is in binary.  General-purpose programs should
often assume nothing about their data.

.IX Subsection "VMS"
Perl on \s-1VMS\s0 is discussed in perlvms in the perl distribution.
.PP
The official name of \s-1VMS\s0 as of this writing is OpenVMS.
.PP
Perl on \s-1VMS\s0 can accept either \s-1VMS\-\s0 or Unix-style file
specifications as in either of the following:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ perl \-ne "print if /perl_setup/i" SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM
\&    $ perl \-ne "print if /perl_setup/i" /sys$login/login.com
.Ve
.PP
but not a mixture of both as in:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ perl \-ne "print if /perl_setup/i" sys$login:/login.com
\&    Can\*(Aqt open sys$login:/login.com: file specification syntax error
.Ve
.PP
Interacting with Perl from the Digital Command Language (\s-1DCL\s0) shell
often requires a different set of quotation marks than Unix shells do.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ perl \-e "print ""Hello, world.\en"""
\&    Hello, world.
.Ve
.PP
There are several ways to wrap your perl scripts in \s-1DCL \s0\fI.COM\fR files, if
you are so inclined.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    $ write sys$output "Hello from DCL!"
\&    $ if p1 .eqs. ""
\&    $ then perl \-x \*(Aqf$environment("PROCEDURE")
\&    $ else perl \-x \- \*(Aqp1 \*(Aqp2 \*(Aqp3 \*(Aqp4 \*(Aqp5 \*(Aqp6 \*(Aqp7 \*(Aqp8
\&    $ deck/dollars="_\|_END_\|_"
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
\&
\&    print "Hello from Perl!\en";
\&
\&    _\|_END_\|_
\&    $ endif
.Ve
.PP
Do take care with \f(CW\*(C`$ ASSIGN/nolog/user SYS$COMMAND: SYS$INPUT\*(C'\fR if your
perl-in-DCL script expects to do things like \f(CW\*(C`$read = <STDIN>;\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \s-1VMS\s0 operating system has two filesystems, known as \s-1ODS\-2\s0 and \s-1ODS\-5.\s0
.PP
For \s-1ODS\-2,\s0 filenames are in the format \*(L"name.extension;version\*(R".  The
maximum length for filenames is 39 characters, and the maximum length for
extensions is also 39 characters.  Version is a number from 1 to
32767.  Valid characters are \f(CW\*(C`/[A\-Z0\-9$_\-]/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \s-1ODS\-2\s0 filesystem is case-insensitive and does not preserve case.
Perl simulates this by converting all filenames to lowercase internally.
.PP
For \s-1ODS\-5,\s0 filenames may have almost any character in them and can include
Unicode characters.  Characters that could be misinterpreted by the \s-1DCL\s0
shell or file parsing utilities need to be prefixed with the \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR
character, or replaced with hexadecimal characters prefixed with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR character.  Such prefixing is only needed with the pathnames are
in \s-1VMS\s0 format in applications.  Programs that can accept the Unix format
of pathnames do not need the escape characters.  The maximum length for
filenames is 255 characters.  The \s-1ODS\-5\s0 file system can handle both
a case preserved and a case sensitive mode.
.PP
\&\s-1ODS\-5\s0 is only available on the OpenVMS for 64 bit platforms.
.PP
Support for the extended file specifications is being done as optional
settings to preserve backward compatibility with Perl scripts that
assume the previous \s-1VMS\s0 limitations.
.PP
In general routines on \s-1VMS\s0 that get a Unix format file specification
should return it in a Unix format, and when they get a \s-1VMS\s0 format
specification they should return a \s-1VMS\s0 format unless they are documented
to do a conversion.
.PP
For routines that generate return a file specification, \s-1VMS\s0 allows setting
if the C library which Perl is built on if it will be returned in \s-1VMS\s0
format or in Unix format.
.PP
With the \s-1ODS\-2\s0 file system, there is not much difference in syntax of
filenames without paths for \s-1VMS\s0 or Unix.  With the extended character
set available with \s-1ODS\-5\s0 there can be a significant difference.
.PP
Because of this, existing Perl scripts written for \s-1VMS\s0 were sometimes
treating \s-1VMS\s0 and Unix filenames interchangeably.  Without the extended
character set enabled, this behavior will mostly be maintained for
backwards compatibility.
.PP
When extended characters are enabled with \s-1ODS\-5,\s0 the handling of
Unix formatted file specifications is to that of a Unix system.
.PP
\&\s-1VMS\s0 file specifications without extensions have a trailing dot.  An
equivalent Unix file specification should not show the trailing dot.
.PP
The result of all of this, is that for \s-1VMS,\s0 for portable scripts, you
can not depend on Perl to present the filenames in lowercase, to be
case sensitive, and that the filenames could be returned in either
Unix or \s-1VMS\s0 format.
.PP
And if a routine returns a file specification, unless it is intended to
convert it, it should return it in the same format as it found it.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR by default has traditionally returned lowercased filenames.
When the \s-1ODS\-5\s0 support is enabled, it will return the exact case of the
filename on the disk.
.PP
Files without extensions have a trailing period on them, so doing a
\&\f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR in the default mode with a file named \fIA.;5\fR will
return \fIa.\fR when \s-1VMS\s0 is (though that file could be opened with
\&\f(CW\*(C`open(FH, \*(AqA\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR).
.PP
With support for extended file specifications and if \f(CW\*(C`opendir\*(C'\fR was
given a Unix format directory, a file named \fIA.;5\fR will return \fIa\fR
and optionally in the exact case on the disk.  When \f(CW\*(C`opendir\*(C'\fR is given
a \s-1VMS\s0 format directory, then \f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR should return \fIa.\fR, and
again with the optionally the exact case.
.PP
\&\s-1RMS\s0 had an eight level limit on directory depths from any rooted logical
(allowing 16 levels overall) prior to \s-1VMS 7.2,\s0 and even with versions of
\&\s-1VMS\s0 on \s-1VAX\s0 up through 7.3.  Hence \f(CW\*(C`PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8]\*(C'\fR is a
valid directory specification but \f(CW\*(C`PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9]\*(C'\fR is
not.  \fIMakefile.PL\fR authors might have to take this into account, but at
least they can refer to the former as \f(CW\*(C`/PERL_ROOT/lib/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Pumpkings and module integrators can easily see whether files with too many
directory levels have snuck into the core by running the following in the
top-level source directory:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ perl \-ne "$_=~s/\es+.*//; print if scalar(split /\e//) > 8;" < MANIFEST
.Ve
.PP
The VMS::Filespec module, which gets installed as part of the build
process on \s-1VMS,\s0 is a pure Perl module that can easily be installed on
non-VMS platforms and can be helpful for conversions to and from \s-1RMS\s0
native formats.  It is also now the only way that you should check to
see if \s-1VMS\s0 is in a case sensitive mode.
.PP
What \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR represents depends on the type of file opened.  It usually
represents \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR but it could also be \f(CW\*(C`\e015\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e000\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\e040\*(C'\fR, or nothing depending on the file organization and 
record format.  The VMS::Stdio module provides access to the 
special \fIfopen()\fR requirements of files with unusual attributes on \s-1VMS.\s0
.PP
\&\s-1TCP/IP\s0 stacks are optional on \s-1VMS,\s0 so socket routines might not be
implemented.  \s-1UDP\s0 sockets may not be supported.
.PP
The \s-1TCP/IP\s0 library support for all current versions of \s-1VMS\s0 is dynamically
loaded if present, so even if the routines are configured, they may
return a status indicating that they are not implemented.
.PP
The value of \f(CW$^O\fR on OpenVMS is \*(L"\s-1VMS\*(R". \s0 To determine the architecture
that you are running on without resorting to loading all of \f(CW%Config\fR
you can examine the content of the \f(CW@INC\fR array like so:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    if (grep(/VMS_AXP/, @INC)) {
\&        print "I\*(Aqm on Alpha!\en";
\&
\&    } elsif (grep(/VMS_VAX/, @INC)) {
\&        print "I\*(Aqm on VAX!\en";
\&
\&    } elsif (grep(/VMS_IA64/, @INC)) {
\&        print "I\*(Aqm on IA64!\en";
\&
\&    } else {
\&        print "I\*(Aqm not so sure about where $^O is...\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
In general, the significant differences should only be if Perl is running
on \s-1VMS_VAX\s0 or one of the 64 bit OpenVMS platforms.
.PP
On \s-1VMS,\s0 perl determines the \s-1UTC\s0 offset from the \f(CW\*(C`SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL\*(C'\fR
logical name.  Although the \s-1VMS\s0 epoch began at 17\-NOV\-1858 00:00:00.00,
calls to \f(CW\*(C`localtime\*(C'\fR are adjusted to count offsets from
01\-JAN\-1970 00:00:00.00, just like Unix.

Even though \s-1VOS\s0 allows the slash character to appear in object
names, because the \s-1VOS\s0 port of Perl interprets it as a pathname
delimiting character, \s-1VOS\s0 files, directories, or links whose

must be renamed before they can be processed by Perl.
.PP
Older releases of \s-1VOS \s0(prior to OpenVOS Release 17.0) limit file
names to 32 or fewer characters, prohibit file names from
starting with a \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR character, and prohibit file names from

Newer releases of \s-1VOS \s0(OpenVOS Release 17.0 or later) support a
feature known as extended names.  On these releases, file names
can contain up to 255 characters, are prohibited from starting
with a \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR character, and the set of prohibited characters is
reduced to any character matching \f(CW\*(C`tr/#%*<>?//\*(C'\fR.  There are
restrictions involving spaces and apostrophes:  these characters
must not begin or end a name, nor can they immediately precede or
follow a period.  Additionally, a space must not immediately
precede another space or hyphen.  Specifically, the following
character combinations are prohibited:  space-space,
space-hyphen, period-space, space-period, period-apostrophe,
apostrophe-period, leading or trailing space, and leading or
trailing apostrophe.  Although an extended file name is limited
to 255 characters, a path name is still limited to 256

As of R2.5 of \s-1USS\s0 for \s-1OS/390\s0 and Version 2.3 of \s-1VM/ESA\s0 these Unix
sub-systems do not support the \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR shebang trick for script invocation.
Hence, on \s-1OS/390\s0 and \s-1VM/ESA\s0 perl scripts can be executed with a header
similar to the following simple script:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    : # use perl
\&        eval \*(Aqexec /usr/local/bin/perl \-S $0 ${1+"$@"}\*(Aq
\&            if 0;
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/perl     # just a comment really
\&
\&    print "Hello from perl!\en";
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1OS/390\s0 will support the \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR shebang trick in release 2.8 and beyond.
Calls to \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR and backticks can use \s-1POSIX\s0 shell syntax on all
S/390 systems.
.PP
On the \s-1AS/400,\s0 if \s-1PERL5\s0 is in your library list, you may need
to wrap your perl scripts in a \s-1CL\s0 procedure to invoke them like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    BEGIN
\&      CALL PGM(PERL5/PERL) PARM(\*(Aq/QOpenSys/hello.pl\*(Aq)
\&    ENDPGM
.Ve
.PP
This will invoke the perl script \fIhello.pl\fR in the root of the
QOpenSys file system.  On the \s-1AS/400\s0 calls to \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR or backticks
must use \s-1CL\s0 syntax.
.PP
On these platforms, bear in mind that the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character set may have
an effect on what happens with some perl functions (such as \f(CW\*(C`chr\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ord\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR), as
well as bit-fiddling with \s-1ASCII\s0 constants using operators like \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR, not to mention dealing with socket interfaces to \s-1ASCII\s0 computers
(see \*(L"Newlines\*(R").
.PP
Fortunately, most web servers for the mainframe will correctly
translate the \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR in the following statement to its \s-1ASCII\s0 equivalent
(\f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR is the same under both Unix and \s-1OS/390\s0):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print "Content\-type: text/html\er\en\er\en";
.Ve
.PP
The values of \f(CW$^O\fR on some of these platforms includes:
.PP

.Ve
.PP
Some simple tricks for determining if you are running on an \s-1EBCDIC\s0
platform could include any of the following (perhaps all):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    if ("\et" eq "\e005")   { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\en"; }
\&
\&    if (ord(\*(AqA\*(Aq) == 193) { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\en"; }
\&
\&    if (chr(169) eq \*(Aqz\*(Aq) { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\en"; }
.Ve
.PP
One thing you may not want to rely on is the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 encoding
of punctuation characters since these may differ from code page to code
page (and once your module or script is rumoured to work with \s-1EBCDIC,\s0
folks will want it to work with all \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character sets).

.IX Subsection "Acorn RISC OS"
Because Acorns use \s-1ASCII\s0 with newlines (\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR) in text files as \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR like
Unix, and because Unix filename emulation is turned on by default, 
most simple scripts will probably work \*(L"out of the box\*(R".  The native
filesystem is modular, and individual filesystems are free to be
case-sensitive or insensitive, and are usually case-preserving.  Some
native filesystems have name length limits, which file and directory
names are silently truncated to fit.  Scripts should be aware that the
standard filesystem currently has a name length limit of \fB10\fR
characters, with up to 77 items in a directory, but other filesystems
may not impose such limitations.
.PP
Native filenames are of the form
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Filesystem#Special_Field::DiskName.$.Directory.Directory.File
.Ve
.PP
where
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    Special_Field is not usually present, but may contain . and $ .
\&    Filesystem =~ m|[A\-Za\-z0\-9_]|
\&    DsicName   =~ m|[A\-Za\-z0\-9_/]|
\&    $ represents the root directory
\&    . is the path separator
\&    @ is the current directory (per filesystem but machine global)
\&    ^ is the parent directory
\&    Directory and File =~ m|[^\e0\- "\e.\e$\e%\e&:\e@\e\e^\e|\e177]+|
.Ve
.PP
The default filename translation is roughly \f(CW\*(C`tr|/.|./|;\*(C'\fR
.PP
Note that \f(CW\*(C`"ADFS::HardDisk.$.File" ne \*(AqADFS::HardDisk.$.File\*(Aq\*(C'\fR and that
the second stage of \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR interpolation in regular expressions will fall
foul of the \f(CW$.\fR if scripts are not careful.
.PP
Logical paths specified by system variables containing comma-separated
search lists are also allowed; hence \f(CW\*(C`System:Modules\*(C'\fR is a valid
filename, and the filesystem will prefix \f(CW\*(C`Modules\*(C'\fR with each section of
\&\f(CW\*(C`System$Path\*(C'\fR until a name is made that points to an object on disk.
Writing to a new file \f(CW\*(C`System:Modules\*(C'\fR would be allowed only if
\&\f(CW\*(C`System$Path\*(C'\fR contains a single item list.  The filesystem will also
expand system variables in filenames if enclosed in angle brackets, so
\&\f(CW\*(C`<System$Dir>.Modules\*(C'\fR would look for the file
\&\f(CW\*(C`$ENV{\*(AqSystem$Dir\*(Aq}\ .\ \*(AqModules\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.  The obvious implication of this is
that \fBfully qualified filenames can start with \f(CB\*(C`<>\*(C'\fB\fR and should
be protected when \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR is used for input.
.PP
Because \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR was in use as a directory separator and filenames could not
be assumed to be unique after 10 characters, Acorn implemented the C
compiler to strip the trailing \f(CW\*(C`.c\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`.h\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`.s\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`.o\*(C'\fR suffix from
filenames specified in source code and store the respective files in
subdirectories named after the suffix.  Hence files are translated:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    foo.h           h.foo
\&    C:foo.h         C:h.foo        (logical path variable)
\&    sys/os.h        sys.h.os       (C compiler groks Unix\-speak)
\&    10charname.c    c.10charname
\&    10charname.o    o.10charname
\&    11charname_.c   c.11charname   (assuming filesystem truncates at 10)
.Ve
.PP
The Unix emulation library's translation of filenames to native assumes
that this sort of translation is required, and it allows a user-defined list
of known suffixes that it will transpose in this fashion.  This may
seem transparent, but consider that with these rules \fIfoo/bar/baz.h\fR
and \fIfoo/bar/h/baz\fR both map to \fIfoo.bar.h.baz\fR, and that \f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR cannot and do not attempt to emulate the reverse mapping.  Other
\&\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR's in filenames are translated to \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
As implied above, the environment accessed through \f(CW%ENV\fR is global, and
the convention is that program specific environment variables are of the
form \f(CW\*(C`Program$Name\*(C'\fR.  Each filesystem maintains a current directory,
and the current filesystem's current directory is the \fBglobal\fR current
directory.  Consequently, sociable programs don't change the current
directory but rely on full pathnames, and programs (and Makefiles) cannot
assume that they can spawn a child process which can change the current
directory without affecting its parent (and everyone else for that
matter).
.PP
Because native operating system filehandles are global and are currently 
allocated down from 255, with 0 being a reserved value, the Unix emulation
library emulates Unix filehandles.  Consequently, you can't rely on
passing \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR to your children.
.PP
The desire of users to express filenames of the form
\&\f(CW\*(C`<Foo$Dir>.Bar\*(C'\fR on the command line unquoted causes problems,
too: \f(CW\*(C`\`\`\*(C'\fR command output capture has to perform a guessing game.  It
assumes that a string \f(CW\*(C`<[^<>]+\e$[^<>]>\*(C'\fR is a
reference to an environment variable, whereas anything else involving
\&\f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR is redirection, and generally manages to be 99%
right.  Of course, the problem remains that scripts cannot rely on any
Unix tools being available, or that any tools found have Unix-like command
line arguments.
.PP
Extensions and \s-1XS\s0 are, in theory, buildable by anyone using free
tools.  In practice, many don't, as users of the Acorn platform are
used to binary distributions.  MakeMaker does run, but no available
make currently copes with MakeMaker's makefiles; even if and when
this should be fixed, the lack of a Unix-like shell will cause
problems with makefile rules, especially lines of the form \f(CW\*(C`cd
sdbm && make all\*(C'\fR, and anything using quoting.
.PP
\&\*(L"\s-1RISC\s0\ \s-1OS\*(R"\s0 is the proper name for the operating system, but the value
in \f(CW$^O\fR is \*(L"riscos\*(R" (because we don't like shouting).

This operator is implemented via the File::Glob extension on most

.IP "gmtime" 8
.IX Item "gmtime"
In theory, \fIgmtime()\fR is reliable from \-2**63 to 2**63\-1.  However,
because work arounds in the implementation use floating point numbers,
it will become inaccurate as the time gets larger.  This is a bug and
will be fixed in the future.

Not implemented, hence not useful for taint checking. (\s-1RISC\s0\ \s-1OS\s0)
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`kill()\*(C'\fR doesn't have the semantics of \f(CW\*(C`raise()\*(C'\fR, i.e. it doesn't send
a signal to the identified process like it does on Unix platforms.
Instead \f(CW\*(C`kill($sig, $pid)\*(C'\fR terminates the process identified by \f(CW$pid\fR,
and makes it exit immediately with exit status \f(CW$sig\fR.  As in Unix, if
\&\f(CW$sig\fR is 0 and the specified process exists, it returns true without
actually terminating it. (Win32)
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`kill(\-9, $pid)\*(C'\fR will terminate the process specified by \f(CW$pid\fR and
recursively all child processes owned by it.  This is different from
the Unix semantics, where the signal will be delivered to all

Link count not updated because hard links are not quite that hard

.Sp
Hard links are implemented on Win32 under \s-1NTFS\s0 only. They are
natively supported on Windows 2000 and later.  On Windows \s-1NT\s0 they
are implemented using the Windows \s-1POSIX\s0 subsystem support and the

ctime not supported on \s-1UFS \s0(Mac\ \s-1OS\s0\ X).

dev, rdev, blksize, and blocks are not available.  inode is not

some versions of cygwin when doing a stat(\*(L"foo\*(R") and if not finding it
may then attempt to stat(\*(L"foo.exe\*(R") (Cygwin)
.Sp
On Win32 \fIstat()\fR needs to open the file to determine the link count
and update attributes that may have been changed through hard links.
Setting ${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} to a true value speeds up \fIstat()\fR by
not performing this operation. (Win32)
.IP "symlink" 8

Not implemented. (Win32, \s-1RISC\s0\ \s-1OS\s0)

Implemented on 64 bit \s-1VMS 8.3.  VMS\s0 requires the symbolic link to be in Unix
syntax if it is intended to resolve to a valid path.

.IP "sysopen" 8
.IX Item "sysopen"
The traditional \*(L"0\*(R", \*(L"1\*(R", and \*(L"2\*(R" MODEs are implemented with different
numeric values on some systems.  The flags exported by \f(CW\*(C`Fcntl\*(C'\fR
(O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR) should work everywhere though.  (Mac\ \s-1OS, OS/390\s0)
.IP "system" 8
.IX Item "system"
As an optimization, may not call the command shell specified in
\&\f(CW$ENV{PERL5SHELL}\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`system(1, @args)\*(C'\fR spawns an external
process and immediately returns its process designator, without
waiting for it to terminate.  Return value may be used subsequently
in \f(CW\*(C`wait\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`waitpid\*(C'\fR.  Failure to \fIspawn()\fR a subprocess is indicated
by setting $? to \*(L"255 << 8\*(R".  \f(CW$?\fR is set in a way compatible with
Unix (i.e. the exitstatus of the subprocess is obtained by \*(L"$? >> 8\*(R",
as described in the documentation).  (Win32)
.Sp
There is no shell to process metacharacters, and the native standard is
to pass a command line terminated by \*(L"\en\*(R" \*(L"\er\*(R" or \*(L"\e0\*(R" to the spawned
program.  Redirection such as \f(CW\*(C`> foo\*(C'\fR is performed (if at all) by
the run time library of the spawned program.  \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR \fIlist\fR will call
the Unix emulation library's \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR emulation, which attempts to provide
emulation of the stdin, stdout, stderr in force in the parent, providing
the child program uses a compatible version of the emulation library.
\&\fIscalar\fR will call the native command line direct and no such emulation
of a child Unix program will exists.  Mileage \fBwill\fR vary.  (\s-1RISC\s0\ \s-1OS\s0)
.Sp
Does not automatically flush output handles on some platforms.
(SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX)
.Sp
The return value is POSIX-like (shifted up by 8 bits), which only allows
room for a made-up value derived from the severity bits of the native
32\-bit condition code (unless overridden by \f(CW\*(C`use vmsish \*(Aqstatus\*(Aq\*(C'\fR). 
If the native condition code is one that has a \s-1POSIX\s0 value encoded, the
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 value will be decoded to extract the expected exit value.
For more details see \*(L"$?\*(R" in perlvms. (\s-1VMS\s0)
.IP "times" 8
.IX Item "times"
\&\*(L"cumulative\*(R" times will be bogus.  On anything other than Windows \s-1NT\s0
or Windows 2000, \*(L"system\*(R" time will be bogus, and \*(L"user\*(R" time is
actually the time returned by the \fIclock()\fR function in the C runtime
library. (Win32)

Not useful. (\s-1RISC\s0\ \s-1OS\s0)

Truncation to same-or-shorter lengths only. (\s-1VOS\s0)

If a \s-1FILEHANDLE\s0 is supplied, it must be writable and opened in append

or \f(CW\*(C`sysopen(FH,...,O_APPEND|O_RDWR)\*(C'\fR.  If a filename is supplied, it
should not be held open elsewhere. (Win32)
.IP "umask" 8
.IX Item "umask"
Returns undef where unavailable.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`umask\*(C'\fR works but the correct permissions are set only when the file
is finally closed. (AmigaOS)
.IP "utime" 8
.IX Item "utime"
Only the modification time is updated. (\s-1VMS, RISC\s0\ \s-1OS\s0)
.Sp
May not behave as expected.  Behavior depends on the C runtime
library's implementation of \fIutime()\fR, and the filesystem being
used.  The \s-1FAT\s0 filesystem typically does not support an \*(L"access
time\*(R" field, and it may limit timestamps to a granularity of
two seconds. (Win32)

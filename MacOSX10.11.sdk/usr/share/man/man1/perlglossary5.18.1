.SS "A"
.IX Subsection "A"
.IP "accessor methods" 4
.IX Item "accessor methods"
A \fBmethod\fR used to
indirectly inspect or update an \fBobject\fRXs state (its \fBinstance
variables\fR).
.IX Xref "accessor methods, defined methods, accessor"
.IP "actual arguments" 4
.IX Item "actual arguments"
The \fBscalar values\fR that you supply
to a \fBfunction\fR or \fBsubroutine\fR when you call it. For instance, when you
call \f(CW\*(C`power("puff")\*(C'\fR, the string \f(CW"puff"\fR is the actual argument. See also
\&\fBargument\fR and \fBformal arguments\fR.
.IX Xref "actual arguments arguments, actual"
.IP "address operator" 4
.IX Item "address operator"
Some languages work directly with the memory addresses of
values, but this can be like playing with fire. Perl provides a set of
asbestos gloves for handling all memory management. The closest to an
address operator in Perl is the backslash operator, but it gives you a
\&\fBhard reference\fR, which is much safer than a memory address.
.IX Xref "address operator"
.IP "algorithm" 4
.IX Item "algorithm"
A well-defined sequence of steps, explained clearly
enough that even a computer could do them.
.IX Xref "algorithms (term)"
.IP "alias" 4
.IX Item "alias"
A nickname for something, which behaves in all ways as
though youXd used the original name instead of the nickname. Temporary
aliases are implicitly created in the loop variable for \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR loops, in
the \f(CW$_\fR variable for \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR operators, in \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR
during \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fRXs comparison function, and in each element of \f(CW@_\fR for the
\&\fBactual arguments\fR of a subroutine call. Permanent aliases are explicitly
created in \fBpackages\fR by \fBimporting\fR symbols or by assignment to
\&\fBtypeglobs\fR. Lexically scoped aliases for package variables are explicitly
created by the \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR declaration.
.IX Xref "aliases, defined"
.IP "alphabetic" 4
.IX Item "alphabetic"
The sort of characters we put into words. In Unicode, this
is all letters including all ideographs and certain diacritics, letter
numbers like Roman numerals, and various combining marks.
.IX Xref "alphabetic sort"
.IP "alternatives" 4
.IX Item "alternatives"
A list of possible choices from which you may
select only one, as in, XWould you like door A, B, or C?X Alternatives in
regular expressions are separated with a single vertical bar: \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR.
Alternatives in normal Perl expressions are separated with a double vertical
bar: \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR. Logical alternatives in \fBBoolean\fR expressions are separated
with either \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`or\*(C'\fR.
.IX Xref "alternative characters"
.IP "anonymous" 4
.IX Item "anonymous"
Used to describe a \fBreferent\fR
that is not directly accessible through a named \fBvariable\fR. Such a referent
must be indirectly accessible through at least one \fBhard reference\fR. When
the last hard reference goes away, the anonymous referent is destroyed
without pity.
.IX Xref "anonymous referents referents, anonymous"
.IP "application" 4
.IX Item "application"
A bigger, fancier sort of \fBprogram\fR with a fancier
name so people donXt realize they are using a program.
.IX Xref "applications (term)"
.IP "architecture" 4
.IX Item "architecture"
The kind of computer youXre working on, where one Xkind of
computerX means all those computers sharing a compatible machine language.
Since Perl programs are (typically) simple text files, not executable
images, a Perl program is much less sensitive to the architecture itXs
running on than programs in other languages, such as C, that are \fBcompiled\fR
into machine code. See also \fBplatform\fR and \fBoperating system\fR.
.IX Xref "architecture"
.IP "argument" 4
.IX Item "argument"
A piece of data supplied to a \fBprogram\fR,
\&\fBsubroutine\fR, \fBfunction\fR, or \fBmethod\fR to tell it what itXs supposed to
do. Also called a XparameterX.
.IX Xref "arguments, defined"
.IP "\s-1ARGV\s0" 4
.IX Item "ARGV"
The name of the array containing the \fBargument\fR \fBvector\fR
from the command line. If you use the empty \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR operator, \f(CW\*(C`ARGV\*(C'\fR
is the name of both the \fBfilehandle\fR used to traverse the arguments and the
\&\fBscalar\fR containing the name of the current input file.
.IX Xref "ARGV filehandle"
.IP "arithmetical operator" 4
.IX Item "arithmetical operator"
A \fBsymbol\fR such as \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR that tells
Perl to do the arithmetic you were supposed to learn in grade school.
.IX Xref "arithmetic operators, about"
.IP "array" 4
.IX Item "array"
An ordered sequence of \fBvalues\fR, stored such that you can
easily access any of the values using an \fIinteger subscript\fR that specifies
the valueXs \fBoffset\fR in the sequence.
.IX Xref "arrays, defined"
.IP "array context" 4
.IX Item "array context"
An archaic expression for what is more correctly referred to
as \fBlist context\fR.
.IX Xref "array context"
.IP "Artistic License" 4
.IX Item "Artistic License"
The open source license that Larry Wall
created for Perl, maximizing PerlXs usefulness, availability, and
modifiability. The current version is 2. (<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic\-license.php>).
.IX Xref "Artistic License Wall, Larry"
.IP "\s-1ASCII\s0" 4
.IX Item "ASCII"
The American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (a 7\-bit character set adequate only for poorly
representing English text). Often used loosely to describe the lowest 128
values of the various \s-1ISO\-8859\-X\s0 character sets, a bunch of mutually
incompatible 8\-bit codes best described as half \s-1ASCII.\s0 See also \fBUnicode\fR.
.IX Xref "ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)"
.IP "assertion" 4
.IX Item "assertion"
A component of a \fBregular expression\fR that must be true for the pattern to
match but does not necessarily match any characters itself. Often used
specifically to mean a \fBzero-width\fR assertion.
.IX Xref "assertions (in regexes), defined regular expressions, assertions in"
.IP "assignment" 4
.IX Item "assignment"
An \fBoperator\fR whose assigned mission in life is to
change the value of a \fBvariable\fR.
.IX Xref "assignments, defined"
.IP "assignment operator" 4
.IX Item "assignment operator"
Either a regular \fBassignment\fR or a compound
\&\fBoperator\fR composed of an ordinary assignment and some other operator, that
changes the value of a variable in place; that is, relative to its old
value. For example, \f(CW\*(C`$a += 2\*(C'\fR adds \f(CW2\fR to \f(CW$a\fR.
.IX Xref "assignment operators, about"
.IP "associative array" 4
.IX Item "associative array"
See \fBhash\fR. Please. The term associative array is the
old Perl 4 term for a \fBhash\fR. Some languages call it a dictionary.
.IX Xref "associative arrays"
.IP "associativity" 4
.IX Item "associativity"
Determines whether you do the left \fBoperator\fR first or the
right \fBoperator\fR first when you have \s-1XA \s0\fBoperator\fR B \fBoperator\fR \s-1CX,\s0 and
the two operators are of the same precedence. Operators like \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR are left
associative, while operators like \f(CW\*(C`**\*(C'\fR are right associative. See Camel
chapter 3, XUnary and Binary OperatorsX for a list of operators and their
associativity.
.IX Xref "associativity"
.IP "asynchronous" 4
.IX Item "asynchronous"
Said of events or activities whose relative
temporal ordering is indeterminate because too many things are going on at
once. Hence, an asynchronous event is one you didnXt know when to expect.
.IX Xref "asynchronous event processing"
.IP "atom" 4
.IX Item "atom"
A \fBregular expression\fR component potentially matching a
\&\fBsubstring\fR containing one or more characters and treated as an indivisible
syntactic unit by any following \fBquantifier\fR. (Contrast with an
\&\fBassertion\fR that matches something of \fBzero width\fR and may not be quantified.)
.IX Xref "atoms"
.IP "atomic operation" 4
.IX Item "atomic operation"
When Democritus gave the word XatomX to the indivisible
bits of matter, he meant literally something that could not be cut: \fIX\-\fR
(not) + \fI\-XXXXX\fR (cuttable). An atomic operation is an action that canXt be
interrupted, not one forbidden in a nuclear-free zone.
.IX Xref "atomic operation"
.IP "attribute" 4
.IX Item "attribute"
A new feature that allows the declaration of
\&\fBvariables\fR and \fBsubroutines\fR with modifiers, as in \f(CW\*(C`sub foo : locked
method\*(C'\fR. Also another name for an \fBinstance variable\fR of an \fBobject\fR.
.IX Xref "attribute feature"
.IP "autogeneration" 4
.IX Item "autogeneration"
A feature of \fBoperator overloading\fR of \fBobjects\fR,
whereby the behavior of certain \fBoperators\fR can be reasonably deduced using
more fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded operators will
often have the same relationships as the regular operators. See Camel
chapter 13, XOverloadingX.
.IX Xref "autogeneration, about"
.IP "autoincrement" 4
.IX Item "autoincrement"
To add one to something automatically, hence the name
of the \f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR operator. To instead subtract one from something automatically
is known as an XautodecrementX.
.IX Xref "autoincrement (term)"
.IP "autoload" 4
.IX Item "autoload"
To load on demand. (Also called XlazyX loading.)
Specifically, to call an \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR subroutine on behalf of an undefined
subroutine.
.IX Xref "autoloading, defined"
.IP "autosplit" 4
.IX Item "autosplit"
To split a string automatically, as the \fIXa\fR \fBswitch\fR
does when running under \fIXp\fR or \fIXn\fR in order to emulate \fBawk\fR. (See also
the \f(CW\*(C`AutoSplit\*(C'\fR module, which has nothing to do with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Xa\*(C'\fR switch but a lot to do with autoloading.)
.IX Xref "autosplit (term) AutoSplit module"
.IP "autovivification" 4
.IX Item "autovivification"
A Graeco-Roman word meaning Xto bring oneself to lifeX.
In Perl, storage locations (\fBlvalues\fR) spontaneously generate themselves as
needed, including the creation of any \fBhard reference\fR values to point to
the next level of storage. The assignment \f(CW\*(C`$a[5][5][5][5][5] = "quintet"\*(C'\fR
potentially creates five scalar storage locations, plus four references (in
the first four scalar locations) pointing to four new anonymous arrays (to
hold the last four scalar locations). But the point of autovivification is
that you donXt have to worry about it.
.IX Xref "autovivification"
.IP "\s-1AV\s0" 4
.IX Item "AV"
Short for Xarray
valueX, which refers to one of PerlXs internal data types that holds an
\&\fBarray\fR. The \f(CW\*(C`AV\*(C'\fR type is a subclass of \fB\s-1SV\s0\fR.
.IX Xref "AV (array value) array value (AV) values, array"
.IP "awk" 4
.IX Item "awk"
Descriptive editing termXshort for XawkwardX. Also
coincidentally refers to a venerable text-processing language from which
Perl derived some of its high-level ideas.
.IX Xref "awk (editing term)"
.SS "B"
.IX Subsection "B"
.IP "backreference" 4
.IX Item "backreference"
A substring \fBcaptured\fR
by a subpattern within unadorned parentheses in a \fBregex\fR. Backslashed
decimal numbers (\f(CW\*(C`\e1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\e2\*(C'\fR, etc.) later in the same pattern refer back to
the corresponding subpattern in the current match. Outside the pattern, the
numbered variables (\f(CW$1\fR, \f(CW$2\fR, etc.) continue to refer to these same
values, as long as the pattern was the last successful match of the current
\&\fBdynamic scope\fR.
.IX Xref "backreferences, about references, backreferences"
.IP "backtracking" 4
.IX Item "backtracking"
The practice of saying, XIf I had to do it all over, IXd do
it differently,X and then actually going back and doing it all over
differently. Mathematically speaking, itXs returning from an unsuccessful
recursion on a tree of possibilities. Perl backtracks when it attempts to
match patterns with a \fBregular expression\fR, and its earlier attempts donXt
pan out. See the section XThe Little Engine That /Couldn(nXt)X in Camel
chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.
.IX Xref "backtracking"
.IP "backward compatibility" 4
.IX Item "backward compatibility"
Means you can still run your old program
because we didnXt break any of the features or bugs it was relying on.
.IX Xref "backward compatibility, defined"
.IP "bareword" 4
.IX Item "bareword"
A word sufficiently ambiguous to be deemed illegal under
\&\f(CW\*(C`use strict \*(Aqsubs\*(Aq\*(C'\fR. In the absence of that stricture, a bareword is
treated as if quotes were around it.
.IX Xref "barewords, about"
.IP "base class" 4
.IX Item "base class"
A generic \fBobject\fR type; that is, a \fBclass\fR
from which other, more specific classes are derived genetically by
\&\fBinheritance\fR. Also called a
XsuperclassX by people who respect their ancestors.
.IX Xref "base classes classes, base superclasses classes, superclasses"
.IP "big-endian" 4
.IX Item "big-endian"
From Swift: someone who
eats eggs big end first. Also used of computers that store the most
significant \fBbyte\fR of a word at a lower byte address than the least
significant byte. Often considered superior to little-endian machines. See
also \fBlittle-endian\fR.
.IX Xref "bigXendian, defined endianness, bigXendian"
.IP "binary" 4
.IX Item "binary"
Having to do with numbers represented in base 2. That means
thereXs basically two numbers: 0 and 1. Also used to describe a file of
XnontextX, presumably because such a file makes full use of all the binary
bits in its bytes. With the advent of \fBUnicode\fR, this distinction, already
suspect, loses even more of its meaning.
.IX Xref "binary (term)"
.IP "binary operator" 4
.IX Item "binary operator"
An \fBoperator\fR that takes two \fBoperands\fR.
.IX Xref "binary operators, about"
.IP "bind" 4

.IX Xref "bind (term)"
.IP "bit" 4
.IX Item "bit"
An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The smallest
possible unit of information storage. An eighth of a \fBbyte\fR or of a dollar.
(The term XPieces of EightX comes from being able to split the old Spanish
dollar into 8 bits, each of which still counted for money. ThatXs why a 25\-
cent piece today is still Xtwo bitsX.)
.IX Xref "bits, defined"
.IP "bit shift" 4
.IX Item "bit shift"
The movement of bits left or right in a
computer word, which has the effect of multiplying or dividing by a
power of 2.
.IX Xref "bitXshift operators, defined"
.IP "bit string" 4
.IX Item "bit string"
A sequence of \fBbits\fR that is actually being thought of as a
sequence of bits, for once.
.IX Xref "bit string"
.IP "bless" 4
.IX Item "bless"
In corporate life, to grant official
approval to a thing, as in, XThe \s-1VP\s0 of Engineering has blessed our
WebCruncher project.X Similarly, in Perl, to grant official approval to a
\&\fBreferent\fR so that it can function as an \fBobject\fR, such as a WebCruncher
object. See the \f(CW\*(C`bless\*(C'\fR function in Camel chapter 27, XFunctionsX.
.IX Xref "bless function, about bless (term)"
.IP "block" 4
.IX Item "block"
What a \fBprocess\fR does when it has to wait for something:
XMy process blocked waiting for the disk.X As an unrelated noun, it refers
to a large chunk of data, of a size that the \fBoperating system\fR likes to
deal with (normally a power of 2 such as 512 or 8192). Typically refers to
a chunk of data thatXs coming from or going to a disk file.
.IX Xref "blocks, defined"
.IP "\s-1BLOCK\s0" 4
.IX Item "BLOCK"
A syntactic construct
consisting of a sequence of Perl \fBstatements\fR that is delimited by braces.
The \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR statements are defined in terms of \fI\f(CI\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fI\fRs, for
instance. Sometimes we also say XblockX to mean a lexical scope; that is, a
sequence of statements that acts like a \fI\f(CI\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fI\fR, such as within an
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR or a file, even though the statements arenXt delimited by braces.
.IX Xref "BLOCK construct, about constructs, BLOCK"
.IP "block buffering" 4
.IX Item "block buffering"
A method of making input and output
efficient by passing one \fBblock\fR at a time. By default, Perl does block
buffering to disk files. See \fBbuffer\fR and \fBcommand buffering\fR.
.IX Xref "block buffering buffering, block"

.IP "Boolean context" 4
.IX Item "Boolean context"
A special kind of \fBscalar

.IP "\s-1BSD\s0" 4
.IX Item "BSD"
A psychoactive drug, popular in the X80s, probably developed at \s-1UC\s0
Berkeley or thereabouts. Similar in many ways to the prescription-only

.IP "thread" 4
.IX Item "thread"
Like a forked process, but without \fBfork\fRXs inherent

.IX Item "titlecase"
The case used for capitals

.IP "toolbox approach" 4
.IX Item "toolbox approach"
The notion that, with a complete set of simple tools
that work well together, you can build almost anything you want. Which is
fine if youXre assembling a tricycle, but if youXre building a

.IP "transliterate" 4
.IX Item "transliterate"
To turn one string
representation into another by mapping each character of the source string
to its corresponding character in the result string. Not to be confused
with translation: for example, Greek \fI\s-1XXXXXXXXXX\s0\fR transliterates into

.IP "Unix" 4
.IX Item "Unix"
A very large and constantly evolving language with several
alternative and largely incompatible syntaxes, in which anyone can define
anything any way they choose, and usually do. Speakers of this language
think itXs easy to learn because itXs so easily twisted to oneXs own ends,
but dialectical differences make tribal intercommunication nearly
impossible, and travelers are often reduced to a pidgin-like subset of the
language. To be universally understood, a Unix shell programmer must spend
years of study in the art. Many have abandoned this discipline and now
communicate via an Esperanto-like language called Perl.

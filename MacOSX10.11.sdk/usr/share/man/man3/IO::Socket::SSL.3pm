.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module provides an interface to \s-1SSL\s0 sockets, similar to other IO::Socket
modules. Because of that, it can be used to make existing programs using
IO::Socket::INET or similar modules to provide \s-1SSL\s0 encryption without much
effort.
IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one needs to write a
full-featured \s-1SSL\s0 client or server application: multiple \s-1SSL\s0 contexts, cipher
selection, certificate verification, Server Name Indication (\s-1SNI\s0), Next
Protocol Negotiation (\s-1NPN\s0), \s-1SSL\s0 version selection and more.
.PP
If you have never used \s-1SSL\s0 before, you should read the section 'Using \s-1SSL\s0'
before attempting to use this module.
.PP
If you used IO::Socket before you should read the following section
\&'Differences to IO::Socket'.
.PP
If you want to use \s-1SSL\s0 with non-blocking sockets and/or within an event loop
please read very carefully the sections about non-blocking I/O and polling of \s-1SSL\s0
sockets.
.PP
If you are trying to use it with threads see the \s-1BUGS\s0 section.
.SS "Differences to IO::Socket"
.IX Subsection "Differences to IO::Socket"
Although IO::Socket::SSL tries to behave similar to IO::Socket there are
some important differences due to the way \s-1SSL\s0 works:
.IP "\(bu" 4
buffered input
.Sp
Data are transmitted inside the \s-1SSL\s0 protocol using encrypted frames, which can
only be decrypted once the full frame is received. So if you use \f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`sysread\*(C'\fR to receive less data than the \s-1SSL\s0 frame contains, it will read the
whole frame, return part of it and buffer the rest for later reads. 
This does not make a difference for simple programs, but if you use
select-loops or polling or non-blocking I/O please read the related sections.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1SSL\s0 handshakes
.Sp
Before any encryption can be done the peers have to agree to common algorithms,
verify certificates etc. So a handshake needs to be done before any payload is
send or received and might additionally happen later in the connection again.
.Sp
This has important implications when doing non-blocking or event-based I/O
(please read the related sections), but means also, that connect and accept
calls include the \s-1SSL\s0 handshake and thus might block or fail, if the peer does
not behave like expected. For instance accept will wait infinitly if a \s-1TCP\s0
client connects to the socket but does not initiate an \s-1SSL\s0 handshake.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
IO::Socket::SSL inherits from another IO::Socket module.
The choice of the super class depends on the installed modules:
.IP "\(bu" 4
If IO::Socket::IP with at least version 0.20 is installed it will use this
module as super class, transparently providing IPv6 and IPv4 support.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If IO::Socket::INET6 is installed it will use this module as super class,
transparently providing IPv6 and IPv4 support.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Otherwise it will fall back to IO::Socket::INET, which is a perl core module.
With IO::Socket::INET you only get IPv4 support.
.PP
Please be aware, that with the IPv6 capable super classes, it will lookup first
for the IPv6 address of a given hostname. If the resolver provides an IPv6
address, but the host cannot be reached by IPv6, there will be no automatic
fallback to IPv4.
To avoid these problems you can either force IPv4 by specifying and \s-1AF_INET\s0
as \f(CW\*(C`Domain\*(C'\fR of the socket or globally enforce IPv4 by loading IO::Socket::SSL
with the option 'inet4'.
.PP
IO::Socket::SSL will provide all of the methods of its super class, but
sometimes it will override them to match the behavior expected from \s-1SSL\s0 or to
provide additional arguments.
.PP
The new or changed methods are described below, but please read also the
section about \s-1SSL\s0 specific error handling.
.IP "\fBnew(...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "new(...)"
Creates a new IO::Socket::SSL object.  You may use all the friendly options
that came bundled with the super class (e.g. IO::Socket::IP,
IO::Socket::INET, ...) plus (optionally) the ones described below.
If you don't specify any \s-1SSL\s0 related options it will do it's best in using
secure defaults, e.g. chosing good ciphers, enabling proper verification etc.
.RS 4
.IP "SSL_hostname" 2
.IX Item "SSL_hostname"
This can be given to specify the hostname used for \s-1SNI,\s0 which is needed if you
have multiple \s-1SSL\s0 hostnames on the same \s-1IP\s0 address. If not given it will try to
determine hostname from PeerAddr, which will fail if only \s-1IP\s0 was given or if
this argument is used within start_SSL.
.Sp
If you want to disable \s-1SNI\s0 set this argument to ''.
.Sp
Currently only supported for the client side and will be ignored for the server
side.
.Sp
See section \*(L"\s-1SNI\s0 Support\*(R" for details of \s-1SNI\s0 the support.
.IP "SSL_version" 2
.IX Item "SSL_version"
Sets the version of the \s-1SSL\s0 protocol used to transmit data. 
\&'SSLv23' auto-negotiates between SSLv2 and SSLv3, while 'SSLv2', 'SSLv3',
\&'TLSv1', 'TLSv1_1' or 'TLSv1_2' restrict the protocol to the specified version.
All values are case-insensitive.  Instead of 'TLSv1_1' and 'TLSv1_2' one can
also use 'TLSv11' and 'TLSv12'.  Support for 'TLSv1_1' and 'TLSv1_2' requires
recent versions of Net::SSLeay and openssl.
.Sp
You can limit to set of supported protocols by adding !version separated by ':'.
.Sp
The default SSL_version is 'SSLv23:!SSLv2' which means, that SSLv2, SSLv3 and
TLSv1 are supported for initial protocol handshakes, but SSLv2 will not be
accepted, leaving only SSLv3 and TLSv1. You can also use !TLSv1_1 and !TLSv1_2
to disable \s-1TLS\s0 versions 1.1 and 1.2 while allowing \s-1TLS\s0 version 1.0.
.Sp
Setting the version instead to 'TLSv1' will probably break interaction with
lots of clients which start with SSLv2 and then upgrade to TLSv1. On the other
side some clients just close the connection when they receive a \s-1TLS\s0 version 1.1
request. In this case setting the version to 'SSLv23:!SSLv2:!TLSv1_1:!TLSv1_2'
might help.
.IP "SSL_cipher_list" 2
.IX Item "SSL_cipher_list"
If this option is set the cipher list for the connection will be set to the
given value, e.g. something like '\s-1ALL:\s0!LOW:!EXP:!aNULL'. Look into the OpenSSL
documentation (<http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER_STRINGS>)
for more details.
.Sp
Unless you fail to contact your peer because of no shared ciphers it is
recommended to leave this option at the default setting. The default setting
prefers ciphers with forward secrecy, disables anonymous authentication and
disables known insecure ciphers like \s-1MD5, DES\s0 etc. This gives a grade A result
at the tests of \s-1SSL\s0 Labs.
To use the less secure OpenSSL builtin default (whatever this is) set
SSL_cipher_list to ''.
.IP "SSL_honor_cipher_order" 2
.IX Item "SSL_honor_cipher_order"
If this option is true the cipher order the server specified is used instead
of the order proposed by the client. This option defaults to true to make use of
our secure cipher list setting.
.IP "SSL_use_cert" 2
.IX Item "SSL_use_cert"
If this is true, it forces IO::Socket::SSL to use a certificate and key, even if
you are setting up an \s-1SSL\s0 client.  If this is set to 0 (the default), then you will
only need a certificate and key if you are setting up a server.
.Sp
SSL_use_cert will implicitly be set if SSL_server is set.
For convenience it is also set if it was not given but a cert was given for use
(SSL_cert_file or similar).
.IP "SSL_server" 2
.IX Item "SSL_server"
Set this option to a true value, if the socket should be used as a server.
If this is not explicitly set it is assumed, if the Listen parameter is given
when creating the socket.
.IP "SSL_cert_file | SSL_cert | SSL_key_file | SSL_key" 2
.IX Item "SSL_cert_file | SSL_cert | SSL_key_file | SSL_key"
If you create a server you usually need to specify a server certificate which
should be verified by the client. Same is true for client certificates, which
should be verified by the server.
The certificate can be given as a file in \s-1PEM\s0 format with SSL_cert_file or
as an internal representation of a X509* object with SSL_cert.
.Sp
For each certificate a key is need, which can either be given as a file in \s-1PEM\s0
format with SSL_key_file or as an internal representation of a EVP_PKEY* object
with SSL_key.
.Sp
If your \s-1SSL\s0 server should be able to use different certificates on the same \s-1IP\s0
address, depending on the name given by \s-1SNI,\s0 you can use a hash reference
instead of a file with \f(CW\*(C`<hostname =\*(C'\fR cert_file>>.
.Sp
In case certs and keys are needed but not given it might fall back to builtin
defaults, see \*(L"Defaults for Cert, Key and \s-1CA\*(R".\s0
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& SSL_cert_file => \*(Aqmycert.pem\*(Aq,
\& SSL_key_file => \*(Aqmykey.pem\*(Aq,
\&
\& SSL_cert_file => {
\&    "foo.example.org" => \*(Aqfoo\-cert.pem\*(Aq,
\&    "bar.example.org" => \*(Aqbar\-cert.pem\*(Aq,
\&    # used when nothing matches or client does not support SNI
\&    \*(Aq\*(Aq => \*(Aqdefault\-cert.pem\*(Aq,
\& }
\& SSL_key_file => {
\&    "foo.example.org" => \*(Aqfoo\-key.pem\*(Aq,
\&    "bar.example.org" => \*(Aqbar\-key.pem\*(Aq,
\&    # used when nothing matches or client does not support SNI
\&    \*(Aq\*(Aq => \*(Aqdefault\-key.pem\*(Aq,
\& }
.Ve
.IP "SSL_dh_file" 2
.IX Item "SSL_dh_file"
If you want Diffie-Hellman key exchange you need to supply a suitable file here
or use the SSL_dh parameter. See dhparam command in openssl for more information.
To create a server which provides forward secrecy you need to either give the \s-1DH\s0
parameters or (better, because faster) the \s-1ECDH\s0 curve.
.Sp
If neither \f(CW\*(C`SSL_dh_file\*(C'\fR not \f(CW\*(C`SSL_dh\*(C'\fR is set a builtin \s-1DH\s0 parameter with a
length of 2048 bit is used to offer \s-1DH\s0 key exchange by default. If you don't
want this (e.g. disable \s-1DH\s0 key exchange) explicitly set this or the \f(CW\*(C`SSL_dh\*(C'\fR
parameter to undef.
.IP "SSL_dh" 2
.IX Item "SSL_dh"
Like SSL_dh_file, but instead of giving a file you use a preloaded or generated DH*.
.IP "SSL_ecdh_curve" 2
.IX Item "SSL_ecdh_curve"
If you want Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellmann key exchange you need to supply the
\&\s-1OID\s0 or \s-1NID\s0 of a suitable curve (like 'prime256v1') here.
To create a server which provides forward secrecy you need to either give the \s-1DH\s0
parameters or (better, because faster) the \s-1ECDH\s0 curve.
.Sp
This parameter defaults to 'prime256v1' (builtin of OpenSSL) to offer \s-1ECDH\s0 key
exchange by default. If you don't want this explicitly set it to undef.
.IP "SSL_passwd_cb" 2
.IX Item "SSL_passwd_cb"
If your private key is encrypted, you might not want the default password prompt from
Net::SSLeay.  This option takes a reference to a subroutine that should return the
password required to decrypt your private key.
.IP "SSL_ca_file | SSL_ca_path" 2
.IX Item "SSL_ca_file | SSL_ca_path"
Usually you want to verify that the peer certificate has been signed by a
trusted certificate authority. In this case you should use this option to
specify the file (SSL_ca_file) or directory (SSL_ca_path) containing the
certificate(s) of the trusted certificate authorities.
If both SSL_ca_file and SSL_ca_path are undefined and not builtin defaults (see
\&\*(L"Defaults for Cert, Key and \s-1CA\*(R".\s0) can be used, it will try to use the system
defaults used built into the OpenSSL library.
If you really don't want to set a \s-1CA\s0 set this key to \f(CW\*(Aq\*(Aq\fR.
.IP "SSL_verify_mode" 2
.IX Item "SSL_verify_mode"
This option sets the verification mode for the peer certificate.
You may combine \s-1SSL_VERIFY_PEER \s0(verify_peer), \s-1SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT
\&\s0(fail verification if no peer certificate exists; ignored for clients),
\&\s-1SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE \s0(verify client once; ignored for clients).
See OpenSSL man page for SSL_CTX_set_verify for more information.

.IP "SSL_verifycn_scheme" 2
.IX Item "SSL_verifycn_scheme"
Set the scheme used to automatically verify the hostname of the peer.
See the information about the verification schemes in \fBverify_hostname\fR.
.Sp
The default is undef, e.g. to not automatically verify the hostname.
If no verification is done the other \fBSSL_verifycn_*\fR options have
no effect, but you might still do manual verification by calling
\&\fBverify_hostname\fR.
.IP "SSL_verifycn_name" 2
.IX Item "SSL_verifycn_name"
Set the name which is used in verification of hostname. If SSL_verifycn_scheme
is set and no SSL_verifycn_name is given it will try to use the PeerHost and
PeerAddr settings and fail if no name can be determined.
.Sp
Using PeerHost or PeerAddr works only if you create the connection directly
with \f(CW\*(C`IO::Socket::SSL\->new\*(C'\fR, if an IO::Socket::INET object is upgraded
with \fBstart_SSL\fR the name has to be given in \fBSSL_verifycn_name\fR.
.IP "SSL_check_crl" 2
.IX Item "SSL_check_crl"
If you want to verify that the peer certificate has not been revoked
by the signing authority, set this value to true. OpenSSL will search
for the \s-1CRL\s0 in your SSL_ca_path, or use the file specified by
SSL_crl_file.  See the Net::SSLeay documentation for more details.
Note that this functionality appears to be broken with OpenSSL <
v0.9.7b, so its use with lower versions will result in an error.
.IP "SSL_crl_file" 2
.IX Item "SSL_crl_file"
If you want to specify the \s-1CRL\s0 file to be used, set this value to the
pathname to be used.  This must be used in addition to setting
SSL_check_crl.
.IP "SSL_reuse_ctx" 2
.IX Item "SSL_reuse_ctx"
If you have already set the above options for a previous instance of
IO::Socket::SSL, then you can reuse the \s-1SSL\s0 context of that instance by passing
it as the value for the SSL_reuse_ctx parameter.  You may also create a
new instance of the IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_Context class, using any context options
that you desire without specifying connection options, and pass that here instead.
.Sp
If you use this option, all other context-related options that you pass
in the same call to \fInew()\fR will be ignored unless the context supplied was invalid.
Note that, contrary to versions of IO::Socket::SSL below v0.90, a global \s-1SSL\s0 context
will not be implicitly used unless you use the \fIset_default_context()\fR function.
.IP "SSL_create_ctx_callback" 2
.IX Item "SSL_create_ctx_callback"
With this callback you can make individual settings to the context after it
got created and the default setup was done.
The callback will be called with the \s-1CTX\s0 object from Net::SSLeay as the single
argument.
.Sp
Example for limiting the server session cache size:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  SSL_create_ctx_callback => sub {

.Ve
.IP "SSL_session_cache_size" 2
.IX Item "SSL_session_cache_size"
If you make repeated connections to the same host/port and the \s-1SSL\s0 renegotiation time
is an issue, you can turn on client-side session caching with this option by specifying a
positive cache size.  For successive connections, pass the SSL_reuse_ctx option to
the \fInew()\fR calls (or use \fIset_default_context()\fR) to make use of the cached sessions.
The session cache size refers to the number of unique host/port pairs that can be
stored at one time; the oldest sessions in the cache will be removed if new ones are
added.
.Sp
This option does not effect the session cache a server has for it's clients, e.g. it
does not affect \s-1SSL\s0 objects with SSL_server set.
.IP "SSL_session_cache" 2
.IX Item "SSL_session_cache"
Specifies session cache object which should be used instead of creating a new.
Overrules SSL_session_cache_size.
This option is useful if you want to reuse the cache, but not the rest of
the context.
.Sp
A session cache object can be created using
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::Socket::SSL::Session_Cache\->new( cachesize )\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Use \fIset_default_session_cache()\fR to set a global cache object.
.IP "SSL_session_key" 2
.IX Item "SSL_session_key"
Specifies a key to use for lookups and inserts into client-side session cache.
Per default ip:port of destination will be used, but sometimes you want to
share the same session over multiple ports on the same server (like with \s-1FTPS\s0).
.IP "SSL_session_id_context" 2
.IX Item "SSL_session_id_context"
This gives an id for the servers session cache. It's necessary if you want
clients to connect with a client certificate. If not given but SSL_verify_mode
specifies the need for client certificate a context unique id will be picked.
.IP "SSL_error_trap" 2
.IX Item "SSL_error_trap"
When using the \fIaccept()\fR or \fIconnect()\fR methods, it may be the case that the
actual socket connection works but the \s-1SSL\s0 negotiation fails, as in the case of
an \s-1HTTP\s0 client connecting to an \s-1HTTPS\s0 server.  Passing a subroutine ref attached
to this parameter allows you to gain control of the orphaned socket instead of having it
be closed forcibly.	 The subroutine, if called, will be passed two parameters:
a reference to the socket on which the \s-1SSL\s0 negotiation failed and the full
text of the error message.
.IP "SSL_npn_protocols" 2
.IX Item "SSL_npn_protocols"
If used on the server side it specifies list of protocols advertised by \s-1SSL\s0
server as an array ref, e.g. ['spdy/2','http1.1'].
On the client side it specifies the protocols offered by the client for \s-1NPN\s0
as an array ref.
See also method next_proto_negotiated.
.Sp
Next Protocol Negotioation (\s-1NPN\s0) is available with Net::SSLeay 1.46+ and openssl\-1.0.1+.
To check support you might call \f(CW\*(C`IO::Socket::SSL\-\*(C'\fR\fIcan_npn()\fR>.

throw an error.

.IP "\fBaccept\fR" 4
.IX Item "accept"
This behaves similar to the accept function of the underlying socket class, but
additionally does the initial \s-1SSL\s0 handshake. But because the underlying socket
class does return a blocking file handle even when accept is called on a
non-blocking socket, the \s-1SSL\s0 handshake on the new file object will be done in a
blocking way. Please see the section about non-blocking I/O for details.
If you don't like this behavior you should do accept on the \s-1TCP\s0 socket and then
upgrade it with \f(CW\*(C`start_SSL\*(C'\fR later.
.IP "\fBconnect(...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "connect(...)"
This behaves similar to the connnect function but also does an \s-1SSL\s0 handshake.
Because you cannot give \s-1SSL\s0 specific arguments to this function, you should
better either use \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR to create a connect \s-1SSL\s0 socket or \f(CW\*(C`start_SSL\*(C'\fR to
upgrade an established \s-1TCP\s0 socket to \s-1SSL.\s0
.IP "\fBclose(...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "close(...)"
There are a number of nasty traps that lie in wait if you are not careful about using
\&\fIclose()\fR.  The first of these will bite you if you have been using \fIshutdown()\fR on your
sockets.  Since the \s-1SSL\s0 protocol mandates that a \s-1SSL \s0\*(L"close notify\*(R" message be
sent before the socket is closed, a \fIshutdown()\fR that closes the socket's write channel
will cause the \fIclose()\fR call to hang.  For a similar reason, if you try to close a
copy of a socket (as in a forking server) you will affect the original socket as well.
To get around these problems, call close with an object-oriented syntax
(e.g. \f(CW$socket\fR\->close(SSL_no_shutdown => 1))
and one or more of the following parameters:
.RS 4
.IP "SSL_no_shutdown" 2
.IX Item "SSL_no_shutdown"
If set to a true value, this option will make \fIclose()\fR not use the \fISSL_shutdown()\fR call
on the socket in question so that the close operation can complete without problems
if you have used \fIshutdown()\fR or are working on a copy of a socket.
.Sp
Not using a real ssl shutdown on a socket will make session caching unusable.
.IP "SSL_fast_shutdown" 2
.IX Item "SSL_fast_shutdown"
If set to true only a unidirectional shutdown will be done, e.g. only the
close_notify (see \fISSL_shutdown\fR\|(3)) will be sent. Otherwise a bidirectional
shutdown will be done where it waits for the close_notify of the peer too.
.Sp
Because a unidirectional shutdown is enough to keep session cache working it
defaults to fast shutdown inside close.
.IP "SSL_ctx_free" 2

.IP "\fBsysread( \s-1BUF, LEN,\s0 [ \s-1OFFSET \s0] )\fR" 4
.IX Item "sysread( BUF, LEN, [ OFFSET ] )"
This function behaves from the outside the same as \fBsysread\fR in other
IO::Socket objects, e.g. it returns at most \s-1LEN\s0 bytes of data. 
But in reality it reads not only \s-1LEN\s0 bytes from the underlying socket, but at
a single \s-1SSL\s0 frame. It then returns up to \s-1LEN\s0 bytes it decrypted from this \s-1SSL\s0
frame. If the frame contained more data than requested it will return only \s-1LEN\s0
data, buffer the rest and return it on futher read calls.
This means, that it might be possible to read data, even if the underlying
socket is not readable, so using poll or select might not be sufficient.
.Sp
sysread will only return data from a single \s-1SSL\s0 frame, e.g. either the pending
data from the already buffered frame or it will read a frame from the underlying
socket and return the decrypted data. It will not return data spanning several
\&\s-1SSL\s0 frames in a single call.
.Sp
Also, calls to sysread might fail, because it must first finish an \s-1SSL\s0
handshake.
.Sp
To understand these behaviors is essential, if you write applications which use
event loops and/or non-blocking sockets. Please read the specific sections in
this documentation.
.IP "\fBsyswrite( \s-1BUF,\s0 [ \s-1LEN,\s0 [ \s-1OFFSET \s0]] )\fR" 4
.IX Item "syswrite( BUF, [ LEN, [ OFFSET ]] )"
This functions behaves from the outside the same as \fBsyswrite\fR in other
IO::Socket objects, e.g. it will write at most \s-1LEN\s0 bytes to the socket, but
there is no guarantee, that all \s-1LEN\s0 bytes are written. It will return the number
of bytes written. 
syswrite will write all the data within a single \s-1SSL\s0 frame, which means, that
no more than 16.384 bytes, which is the maximum size of an \s-1SSL\s0 frame, can be
written at once.
.Sp
For non-blocking sockets \s-1SSL\s0 specific behavior applies.

This function has exactly the same syntax as \fBsysread\fR, and performs nearly the
same task but will not advance the read position so that successive calls to

Simple wildcards in subjectAltNames are possible, e.g. *.example.org matches

Note that if \fIstart_SSL()\fR fails in \s-1SSL\s0 negotiation, \f(CW$socket\fR will remain blessed in its
original class.	 For non-blocking sockets you better just upgrade the socket to
IO::Socket::SSL and call accept_SSL or connect_SSL and the upgraded object. To
just upgrade the socket set \fBSSL_startHandshake\fR explicitly to 0. If you call start_SSL
w/o this parameter it will revert to blocking behavior for accept_SSL and connect_SSL.

If given the parameter \*(L"Timeout\*(R" it will stop if after the timeout no \s-1SSL\s0 connection

It will set SSL_ca_file to \f(CW\*(C`certs/my\-ca.pem\*(C'\fR if it exist.
Otherwise it will set SSL_ca_path to \f(CW\*(C`ca/\*(C'\fR if it exist.
.PP
\&\fBPlease note, that these defaults are depreciated and will be removed in the

If you don't specify a \s-1CA\s0 file or path it will fall back to the system default
built into OpenSSL.
.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
.IX Header "ERROR HANDLING"
If an \s-1SSL\s0 specific error occurs the global variable \f(CW$SSL_ERROR\fR will be set.
If the error occurred on an existing \s-1SSL\s0 socket the method \f(CW\*(C`errstr\*(C'\fR will
give access to the latest socket specific error.
Both \f(CW$SSL_ERROR\fR and \f(CW\*(C`errstr\*(C'\fR method give a dualvar similar to \f(CW$!\fR, e.g.
providing an error number in numeric context or an error description in string
context.
.SH "Polling of SSL Sockets (e.g. select, poll and other event loops)"
.IX Header "Polling of SSL Sockets (e.g. select, poll and other event loops)"
If you sysread one byte on a normal socket it will result in a syscall to read
one byte. Thus, if more than one byte is available on the socket it will be kept
in the network stack of your \s-1OS\s0 and the next select or poll call will return the
socket as readable.
But, with \s-1SSL\s0 you don't deliver single bytes. Multiple data bytes are packet
and encrypted together in an \s-1SSL\s0 frame. Decryption can only be done on the whole
frame, so a sysread for one byte actually reads the complete \s-1SSL\s0 frame from the
socket, decrypts it and returns the first decrypted byte. Further sysreads will
return more bytes from the same frame until all bytes are returned and the
next \s-1SSL\s0 frame will be read from the socket.
.PP
Thus, in order to decide if you can read more data (e.g. if sysread will block)
you must check, if there are still data in the current \s-1SSL\s0 frame by calling
\&\f(CW\*(C`pending\*(C'\fR and if there are no data pending you might check the underlying
socket with select or poll.
Another way might be if you try to sysread at least 16k all the time. 16k is the
maximum size of an \s-1SSL\s0 frame and because sysread returns data from only a single
\&\s-1SSL\s0 frame you guarantee this way, that there are no pending data.
Please see the example on top of this documentation on how to use \s-1SSL\s0 within a
select loop.
.SH "Non-blocking I/O"
.IX Header "Non-blocking I/O"
If you have a non-blocking socket, the expected behavior on read, write, accept
or connect is to set \f(CW$!\fR to \s-1EAGAIN\s0 if the operation can not be completed
immediately.
.PP
With \s-1SSL\s0 handshakes might occure at any time, even within an established
connections. In this cases it is necessary to finish the handshake, before
you can read or write data. This might result in situations, where you want to
read but must first finish the write of a handshake or where you want to write
but must first finish a read.
In these cases \f(CW$!\fR is set to \s-1EGAIN\s0 like expected, and additionally
\&\f(CW$SSL_ERROR\fR is set to either \s-1SSL_WANT_READ\s0 or \s-1SSL_WANT_WRITE.\s0
Thus if you get \s-1EAGAIN\s0 on a \s-1SSL\s0 socket you must check \f(CW$SSL_ERROR\fR for
SSL_WANT_* and adapt your event mask accordingly.
.PP
Using readline on non-blocking sockets does not make much sense and I would
advise against using it.
And, while the behavior is not documented for other IO::Socket classes, it
will try to emulate the behavior seen there, e.g. to return the received data
instead of blocking, even if the line is not complete. If an unrecoverable error
occurs it will return nothing, even if it already received some data.
.PP
Also, I would advise against using \f(CW\*(C`accept\*(C'\fR with a non-blocking \s-1SSL\s0 object,
because it might block and this is not what most would expect. The reason for
this is that accept on a non-blocking \s-1TCP\s0 socket (e.g. IO::Socket::IP,
IO::Socket::INET..) results in a new \s-1TCP\s0 socket, which does not inherit the
non-blocking behavior of the master socket. And thus the initial \s-1SSL\s0 handshake
on the new socket inside \f(CW\*(C`IO::Socket::SSL::accept\*(C'\fR will be done in a blocking
way. To work around it you should better do an \s-1TCP\s0 accept and later upgrade the
\&\s-1TCP\s0 socket in a non-blocking way with \f(CW\*(C`start_SSL\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`accept_SSL\*(C'\fR.
.SH "SNI Support"
.IX Header "SNI Support"
Newer extensions to \s-1SSL\s0 can distinguish between multiple hostnames on the same
\&\s-1IP\s0 address using Server Name Indication (\s-1SNI\s0).
.PP
Support for \s-1SNI\s0 on the client side was added somewhere in the OpenSSL 0.9.8
series, but only with 1.0 a bug was fixed when the server could not decide about
its hostname. Therefore client side \s-1SNI\s0 is only supported with OpenSSL 1.0 or
higher in IO::Socket::SSL.
With a supported version, \s-1SNI\s0 is used automatically on the client side, if it can
determine the hostname from \f(CW\*(C`PeerAddr\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`PeerHost\*(C'\fR. On unsupported OpenSSL
versions it will silently not use \s-1SNI.\s0
The hostname can also be given explicitly given with \f(CW\*(C`SSL_hostname\*(C'\fR, but in
this case it will throw in error, if \s-1SNI\s0 is not supported.
To check for support you might call \f(CW\*(C`IO::Socket::SSL\-\*(C'\fR\fIcan_client_sni()\fR>.
.PP
On the server side earlier versions of OpenSSL are supported, but only together
with Net::SSLeay version >= 1.50.
To check for support you might call \f(CW\*(C`IO::Socket::SSL\-\*(C'\fR\fIcan_server_sni()\fR>.
If server side \s-1SNI\s0 is supported, you might specify different certificates per
host with \f(CW\*(C`SSL_cert*\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SSL_key*\*(C'\fR, and check the requested name using
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_servername\*(C'\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
A few changes have gone into IO::Socket::SSL v0.93 and later with respect to
return values.	The behavior on success remains unchanged, but for \fIall\fR functions,
the return value on error is now an empty list.	 Therefore, the return value will be
false in all contexts, but those who have been using the return values as arguments
to subroutines (like \f(CW\*(C`mysub(IO::Socket::SSL(...)\-\*(C'\fRnew, ...)>) may run into problems.
The moral of the story: \fIalways\fR check the return values of these functions before
using them in any way that you consider meaningful.
.SH "DEBUGGING"
.IX Header "DEBUGGING"
If you are having problems using IO::Socket::SSL despite the fact that can recite backwards
the section of this documentation labelled 'Using \s-1SSL\s0', you should try enabling debugging.	To
specify the debug level, pass 'debug#' (where # is a number from 0 to 3) to IO::Socket::SSL
when calling it.
The debug level will also be propagated to Net::SSLeay::trace, see also Net::SSLeay:
.IP "use IO::Socket::SSL qw(debug0);" 4
.IX Item "use IO::Socket::SSL qw(debug0);"
No debugging (default).
.IP "use IO::Socket::SSL qw(debug1);" 4

information from Net::SSLeay.

.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
IO::Socket::SSL depends on Net::SSLeay.  Up to version 1.43 of Net::SSLeay
it was not thread safe, although it did probably work if you did not use
SSL_verify_callback and SSL_password_cb.
.PP
If you use IO::Socket::SSL together with threads you should load it (e.g. use or
require) inside the main thread before creating any other threads which use it.
This way it is much faster because it will be initialized only once. Also there
are reports that it might crash the other way.
.PP
Creating an IO::Socket::SSL object in one thread and closing it in another
thread will not work.
.PP
IO::Socket::SSL does not work together with Storable::fd_retrieve/fd_store.
See \s-1BUGS\s0 file for more information and how to work around the problem.
.PP
Non-blocking and timeouts (which are based on non-blocking) are not
supported on Win32, because the underlying IO::Socket::INET does not support
non-blocking on this platform.
.PP
If you have a server and it looks like you have a memory leak you might
check the size of your session cache. Default for Net::SSLeay seems to be
20480, see the example for SSL_create_ctx_callback for how to limit it.
.PP
The default for SSL_verify_mode on the client is currently \s-1SSL_VERIFY_NONE,\s0
which is a very bad idea, thus the default will change in the near future.
See documentation for SSL_verify_mode for more information.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.IX Header "LIMITATIONS"
IO::Socket::SSL uses Net::SSLeay as the shiny interface to OpenSSL, which is
the shiny interface to the ugliness of \s-1SSL.	\s0 As a result, you will need both Net::SSLeay
and OpenSSL on your computer before using this module.
.PP
If you have Scalar::Util (standard with Perl 5.8.0 and above) or WeakRef, IO::Socket::SSL
sockets will auto-close when they go out of scope, just like IO::Socket::INET sockets.	If
you do not have one of these modules, then IO::Socket::SSL sockets will stay open until the
program ends or you explicitly close them.	This is due to the fact that a circular reference
is required to make IO::Socket::SSL sockets act simultaneously like objects and glob references.

If you are unfamiliar with the way OpenSSL works, good references may be found in
both the book \*(L"Network Security with OpenSSL\*(R" (Oreilly & Assoc.) and the web site
<http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL\-Certificates\-HOWTO/>.  Read on for a quick overview.
.SS "The Long of It (Detail)"
.IX Subsection "The Long of It (Detail)"
The usual reason for using \s-1SSL\s0 is to keep your data safe.  This means that not only
do you have to encrypt the data while it is being transported over a network, but
you also have to make sure that the right person gets the data, e.g. you need to
authenticate the person.
To accomplish this with \s-1SSL,\s0 you have to use certificates.
A certificate closely resembles a Government-issued \s-1ID \s0(at least in places where
you can trust them). The \s-1ID\s0 contains some sort of identifying information such
as a name and address, and is usually stamped with a seal of Government
Approval. Theoretically, this means that you may trust the information on the
card and do business with the owner of the card.
The same ideas apply to \s-1SSL\s0 certificates, which have some identifying
information and are \*(L"stamped\*(R" (signed) by someone (a \s-1CA,\s0 e.g. Certificate
Authority) who you trust will adequately verify the identifying information. In
this case, because of some clever number theory, it is extremely difficult to
falsify the signing process. Another useful consequence of number theory is that
the certificate is linked to the encryption process, so you may encrypt data
(using information on the certificate) that only the certificate owner can
decrypt.
.PP
What does this mean for you?
So most common case is that at least the server has a certificate which the
client can verify, but the server may also ask back for a certificate to
authenticate the client.
To verify that a certificate is trusted, one checks if the certificate is signed
by the expected \s-1CA \s0(Certificate Authority), which often means any \s-1CA\s0 installed
on the system (IO::Socket::SSL tries to use the CAs installed on the system by
default). So if you trust the \s-1CA,\s0 trust the number theory and trust the
used algorithms you can be confident, that no-one is reading your data.
.PP
Beside the authentication using certificates there is also anonymous
authentication, which effectivly means no authentication. In this case it is
easy for somebody in between to intercept the connection, e.g. playing man in
the middle and nobody notices.
By default IO::Socket::SSL uses only ciphers which require certificates and
which are safe enough, but if you want to set your own cipher_list make sure,
that you explicitly exclude anonymous authentication. E.g. setting the cipher
list to \s-1HIGH\s0 is not enough, you should use at least \s-1HIGH:\s0!aNULL.
.SS "The Short of It (Summary)"
.IX Subsection "The Short of It (Summary)"
For servers, you will need to generate a cryptographic private key and a certificate
request.  You will need to send the certificate request to a Certificate Authority to
get a real certificate back, after which you can start serving people.	For clients,
you will not need anything unless the server wants validation, in which case you will
also need a private key and a real certificate.	 For more information about how to
get these, see <http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#ToC24>.

.SH "NAME"
Time::Piece \- Object Oriented time objects
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&    use Time::Piece;
\&    
\&    my $t = localtime;
\&    print "Time is $t\en";
\&    print "Year is ", $t\->year, "\en";
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module replaces the standard localtime and gmtime functions with
implementations that return objects. It does so in a backwards
compatible manner, so that using localtime/gmtime in the way documented
in perlfunc will still return what you expect.
.PP
The module actually implements most of an interface described by
Larry Wall on the perl5\-porters mailing list here:
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing\-lists/perl5\-porters/2000\-01/msg00241.html
.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
After importing this module, when you use localtime or gmtime in a scalar
context, rather than getting an ordinary scalar string representing the
date and time, you get a Time::Piece object, whose stringification happens
to produce the same effect as the localtime and gmtime functions. There is 
also a \fInew()\fR constructor provided, which is the same as \fIlocaltime()\fR, except
when passed a Time::Piece object, in which case it's a copy constructor. The
following methods are available on the object:
.PP

.SS "Local Locales"
.IX Subsection "Local Locales"
Both wdayname (day) and monname (month) allow passing in a list to use
to index the name of the days against. This can be useful if you need
to implement some form of localisation without actually installing or
using locales.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my @days = qw( Dimanche Lundi Merdi Mercredi Jeudi Vendredi Samedi );
\&
\&  my $french_day = localtime\->day(@days);
.Ve
.PP
These settings can be overriden globally too:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  Time::Piece::day_list(@days);
.Ve
.PP
Or for months:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  Time::Piece::mon_list(@months);
.Ve
.PP
And locally for months:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  print localtime\->month(@months);
.Ve
.SS "Date Calculations"
.IX Subsection "Date Calculations"
It's possible to use simple addition and subtraction of objects:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Time::Seconds;
\&    
\&    my $seconds = $t1 \- $t2;
\&    $t1 += ONE_DAY; # add 1 day (constant from Time::Seconds)
.Ve
.PP
The following are valid ($t1 and \f(CW$t2\fR are Time::Piece objects):
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $t1 \- $t2; # returns Time::Seconds object
\&    $t1 \- 42; # returns Time::Piece object
\&    $t1 + 533; # returns Time::Piece object
.Ve
.PP
However adding a Time::Piece object to another Time::Piece object
will cause a runtime error.
.PP
Note that the first of the above returns a Time::Seconds object, so
while examining the object will print the number of seconds (because
of the overloading), you can also get the number of minutes, hours,
days, weeks and years in that delta, using the Time::Seconds \s-1API.\s0
.PP
In addition to adding seconds, there are two APIs for adding months and
years:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $t\->add_months(6);
\&    $t\->add_years(5);
.Ve
.PP
The months and years can be negative for subtractions. Note that there
is some \*(L"strange\*(R" behaviour when adding and subtracting months at the
ends of months. Generally when the resulting month is shorter than the
starting month then the number of overlap days is added. For example
subtracting a month from 2008\-03\-31 will not result in 2008\-02\-31 as this
is an impossible date. Instead you will get 2008\-03\-02. This appears to
be consistent with other date manipulation tools.
.SS "Date Comparisons"
.IX Subsection "Date Comparisons"
Date comparisons are also possible, using the full suite of \*(L"<\*(R", \*(L">\*(R",
\&\*(L"<=\*(R", \*(L">=\*(R", \*(L"<=>\*(R", \*(L"==\*(R" and \*(L"!=\*(R".
.SS "Date Parsing"
.IX Subsection "Date Parsing"
Time::Piece has a built-in \fIstrptime()\fR function (from FreeBSD), allowing
you incredibly flexible date parsing routines. For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $t = Time::Piece\->strptime("Sunday 3rd Nov, 1943",
\&                                "%A %drd %b, %Y");
\&  
\&  print $t\->strftime("%a, %d %b %Y");
.Ve
.PP
Outputs:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  Wed, 03 Nov 1943
.Ve
.PP
(see, it's even smart enough to fix my obvious date bug)
.PP
For more information see \*(L"man strptime\*(R", which should be on all unix
systems.
.PP
Alternatively look here: http://www.unix.com/man\-page/FreeBSD/3/strftime/
.SS "YYYY\-MM\-DDThh:mm:ss"
.IX Subsection "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss"
The \s-1ISO 8601\s0 standard defines the date format to be YYYY-MM-DD, and
the time format to be hh:mm:ss (24 hour clock), and if combined, they
should be concatenated with date first and with a capital 'T' in front
of the time.
.SS "Week Number"
.IX Subsection "Week Number"
The \fIweek number\fR may be an unknown concept to some readers.  The \s-1ISO
8601\s0 standard defines that weeks begin on a Monday and week 1 of the
year is the week that includes both January 4th and the first Thursday
of the year.  In other words, if the first Monday of January is the
2nd, 3rd, or 4th, the preceding days of the January are part of the
last week of the preceding year.  Week numbers range from 1 to 53.
.SS "Global Overriding"
.IX Subsection "Global Overriding"
Finally, it's possible to override localtime and gmtime everywhere, by
including the ':override' tag in the import list:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Time::Piece \*(Aq:override\*(Aq;
.Ve
.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
.ie n .SS "Setting $ENV{\s-1TZ\s0} in Threads on Win32"
.el .SS "Setting \f(CW$ENV\fP{\s-1TZ\s0} in Threads on Win32"
.IX Subsection "Setting $ENV{TZ} in Threads on Win32"
Note that when using perl in the default build configuration on Win32
(specifically, when perl is built with \s-1PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS\s0), each perl
interpreter maintains its own copy of the environment and only the main
interpreter will update the process environment seen by strftime.
.PP
Therefore, if you make changes to \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1TZ\s0} from inside a thread other than
the main thread then those changes will not be seen by strftime if you
subsequently call that with the \f(CW%Z\fR formatting code. You must change \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1TZ\s0}
in the main thread to have the desired effect in this case (and you must
also call \fI_tzset()\fR in the main thread to register the environment change).
.PP
Furthermore, remember that this caveat also applies to \fIfork()\fR, which is
emulated by threads on Win32.
.SS "Use of epoch seconds"
.IX Subsection "Use of epoch seconds"
This module internally uses the epoch seconds system that is provided via
the perl \f(CW\*(C`time()\*(C'\fR function and supported by \f(CW\*(C`gmtime()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`localtime()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If your perl does not support times larger than \f(CW\*(C`2^31\*(C'\fR seconds then this
module is likely to fail at processing dates beyond the year 2038. There are
moves afoot to fix that in perl. Alternatively use 64 bit perl. Or if none
of those are options, use the DateTime module which has support for years
well into the future and past.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \f(CW\*(C`use utf8\*(C'\fR pragma tells the Perl parser to allow \s-1UTF\-8\s0 in the
program text in the current lexical scope (allow UTF-EBCDIC on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 based
platforms).  The \f(CW\*(C`no utf8\*(C'\fR pragma tells Perl to switch back to treating
the source text as literal bytes in the current lexical scope.
.PP
\&\fBDo not use this pragma for anything else than telling Perl that your
script is written in \s-1UTF\-8.\s0\fR The utility functions described below are
directly usable without \f(CW\*(C`use utf8;\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Because it is not possible to reliably tell \s-1UTF\-8\s0 from native 8 bit
encodings, you need either a Byte Order Mark at the beginning of your
source code, or \f(CW\*(C`use utf8;\*(C'\fR, to instruct perl.
.PP
When \s-1UTF\-8\s0 becomes the standard source format, this pragma will
effectively become a no-op.  For convenience in what follows the term
\&\fIUTF-X\fR is used to refer to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 on \s-1ASCII\s0 and \s-1ISO\s0 Latin based
platforms and UTF-EBCDIC on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 based platforms.
.PP
See also the effects of the \f(CW\*(C`\-C\*(C'\fR switch and its cousin, the
\&\f(CW$ENV{PERL_UNICODE}\fR, in perlrun.
.PP
Enabling the \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR pragma has the following effect:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Bytes in the source text that have their high-bit set will be treated
as being part of a literal UTF-X sequence.  This includes most
literals such as identifier names, string constants, and constant
regular expression patterns.
.Sp
On \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms characters in the Latin 1 character set are
treated as being part of a literal UTF-EBCDIC character.
.PP
Note that if you have bytes with the eighth bit on in your script
(for example embedded Latin\-1 in your string literals), \f(CW\*(C`use utf8\*(C'\fR
will be unhappy since the bytes are most probably not well-formed
UTF-X.  If you want to have such bytes under \f(CW\*(C`use utf8\*(C'\fR, you can disable
this pragma until the end the block (or file, if at top level) by
\&\f(CW\*(C`no utf8;\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Utility functions"
.IX Subsection "Utility functions"
The following functions are defined in the \f(CW\*(C`utf8::\*(C'\fR package by the
Perl core.  You do not need to say \f(CW\*(C`use utf8\*(C'\fR to use these and in fact
you should not say that  unless you really want to have \s-1UTF\-8\s0 source code.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$num_octets\fR = utf8::upgrade($string)
.Sp
Converts in-place the internal representation of the string from an octet
sequence in the native encoding (Latin\-1 or \s-1EBCDIC\s0) to \fIUTF-X\fR. The
logical character sequence itself is unchanged.  If \fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR is already
stored as \fIUTF-X\fR, then this is a no-op. Returns the
number of octets necessary to represent the string as \fIUTF-X\fR.  Can be
used to make sure that the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 flag is on, so that \f(CW\*(C`\ew\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`lc()\*(C'\fR
work as Unicode on strings containing characters in the range 0x80\-0xFF
(on \s-1ASCII\s0 and derivatives).
.Sp
\&\fBNote that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.\fR
Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also
Encode.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$success\fR = utf8::downgrade($string[, \s-1FAIL_OK\s0])
.Sp
Converts in-place the internal representation of the string from
\&\fIUTF-X\fR to the equivalent octet sequence in the native encoding (Latin\-1
or \s-1EBCDIC\s0). The logical character sequence itself is unchanged. If
\&\fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR is already stored as native 8 bit, then this is a no-op.  Can
be used to
make sure that the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 flag is off, e.g. when you want to make sure
that the \fIsubstr()\fR or \fIlength()\fR function works with the usually faster
byte algorithm.
.Sp
Fails if the original \fIUTF-X\fR sequence cannot be represented in the
native 8 bit encoding. On failure dies or, if the value of \f(CW\*(C`FAIL_OK\*(C'\fR is
true, returns false.
.Sp
Returns true on success.
.Sp
\&\fBNote that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.\fR
Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also
Encode.
.IP "\(bu" 4
utf8::encode($string)
.Sp
Converts in-place the character sequence to the corresponding octet
sequence in \fIUTF-X\fR. That is, every (possibly wide) character gets
replaced with a sequence of one or more characters that represent the
individual \fIUTF-X\fR bytes of the character.  The \s-1UTF8\s0 flag is turned off.
Returns nothing.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $a = "\ex{100}"; # $a contains one character, with ord 0x100
\&    utf8::encode($a);  # $a contains two characters, with ords 0xc4 and 0x80
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBNote that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.\fR
Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also
Encode.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$success\fR = utf8::decode($string)
.Sp
Attempts to convert in-place the octet sequence in \fIUTF-X\fR to the
corresponding character sequence. That is, it replaces each sequence of
characters in the string whose ords represent a valid UTF-X byte
sequence, with the corresponding single character.  The \s-1UTF\-8\s0 flag is
turned on only if the source string contains multiple-byte \fIUTF-X\fR
characters.  If \fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR is invalid as \fIUTF-X\fR, returns false;
otherwise returns true.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $a = "\exc4\ex80"; # $a contains two characters, with ords 0xc4 and 0x80
\&    utf8::decode($a);   # $a contains one character, with ord 0x100
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBNote that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.\fR
Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also
Encode.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$flag\fR = utf8::is_utf8(\s-1STRING\s0)
.Sp
(Since Perl 5.8.1)  Test whether \s-1STRING\s0 is encoded internally in \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
Functionally the same as \fIEncode::is_utf8()\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$flag\fR = utf8::valid(\s-1STRING\s0)
.Sp
[\s-1INTERNAL\s0] Test whether \s-1STRING\s0 is in a consistent state regarding
\&\s-1UTF\-8. \s0 Will return true if it is well-formed \s-1UTF\-8\s0 and has the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 flag
on \fBor\fR if \s-1STRING\s0 is held as bytes (both these states are 'consistent').
Main reason for this routine is to allow Perl's testsuite to check
that operations have left strings in a consistent state.  You most
probably want to use \fIutf8::is_utf8()\fR instead.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::encode\*(C'\fR is like \f(CW\*(C`utf8::upgrade\*(C'\fR, but the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag is
cleared.  See perlunicode for more on the \s-1UTF8\s0 flag and the C \s-1API\s0
functions \f(CW\*(C`sv_utf8_upgrade\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sv_utf8_downgrade\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sv_utf8_encode\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`sv_utf8_decode\*(C'\fR, which are wrapped by the Perl functions
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::upgrade\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8::downgrade\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8::encode\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`utf8::decode\*(C'\fR.  Also, the functions utf8::is_utf8, utf8::valid,
utf8::encode, utf8::decode, utf8::upgrade, and utf8::downgrade are
actually internal, and thus always available, without a \f(CW\*(C`require utf8\*(C'\fR
statement.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
One can have Unicode in identifier names, but not in package/class or
subroutine names.  While some limited functionality towards this does
exist as of Perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than designed; use of
Unicode for the said purposes is unsupported.
.PP
One reason of this unfinishedness is its (currently) inherent
unportability: since both package names and subroutine names may need
to be mapped to file and directory names, the Unicode capability of
the filesystem becomes important\*(-- and there unfortunately aren't
portable answers.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This documents any important or noteworthy changes in Moose, with a
focus on things that affect backwards compatibility. This does duplicate data
from the \fIChanges\fR file, but aims to provide more details and when possible
workarounds.
.PP
Besides helping keep up with changes, you can also use this document
for finding the lowest version of Moose that supported a given
feature.  If you encounter a problem and have a solution but don't see
it documented here, or think we missed an important feature, please
send us a patch.
.SH "2.1200"
.IX Header "2.1200"
.ie n .IP "Classes created by Moose are now registered in %INC" 4
.el .IP "Classes created by Moose are now registered in \f(CW%INC\fR" 4
.IX Item "Classes created by Moose are now registered in %INC"
This means that this will no longer die (and will also no longer try to load
\&\f(CW\*(C`Foo.pm\*(C'\fR):
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  {
\&      package Foo;
\&      use Moose;
\&  }
\&
\&  # ...
\&
\&  use Foo;
.Ve
.Sp
If you're using the \s-1MOP,\s0 this behavior will occur when the \f(CW\*(C`create\*(C'\fR (or
\&\f(CW\*(C`create_anon_class\*(C'\fR) method is used, but not when the \f(CW\*(C`initialize\*(C'\fR method
is used.
.IP "Moose now uses Module::Runtime instead of Class::Load to load classes" 4
.IX Item "Moose now uses Module::Runtime instead of Class::Load to load classes"
Class::Load has always had some weird issues with the ways that it tries to
figure out if a class is loaded. For instance, extending an empty package was
previously impossible, because Class::Load would think that the class failed to
load, even though that is a perfectly valid thing to do. It was also difficult
to deal with modules like IO::Handle, which partially populate several other
packages when they are loaded (so calling \f(CW\*(C`load_class\*(C'\fR on \f(CW\*(AqIO::Handle\*(Aq\fR
followed by \f(CW\*(AqIO::File\*(Aq\fR could end up with a broken \f(CW\*(C`IO::File\*(C'\fR, in some
cases).
.Sp
Now, Moose uses the same mechanisms as perl itself to figure out if a class is
loaded. A class is considered to be loaded if its entry in \f(CW%INC\fR is set. Perl
sets the \f(CW%INC\fR entry for you automatically whenever a file is loaded via
\&\f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR. Also, as mentioned above, Moose also now sets the \f(CW%INC\fR
entry for any classes defined with it, even if they aren't loaded from a
separate file. This does however mean that if you are trying to use Moose with
non-Moose classes defined in the same file, then you will need to set \f(CW%INC\fR
manually now, where it may have worked in the past. For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  {
\&      package My::NonMoose;
\&
\&      sub new { bless {}, shift }
\&
\&      $INC{\*(AqMy/NonMoose.pm\*(Aq} = _\|_FILE_\|_;
\&      # alternatively:
\&      # use Module::Runtime \*(Aqmodule_notional_filename\*(Aq;
\&      # $INC{module_notional_filename(_\|_PACKAGE_\|_)} = _\|_FILE_\|_;
\&  }
\&
\&  {
\&      package My::Moose;
\&      use Moose;
\&
\&      extends \*(AqMy::NonMoose\*(Aq;
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
If you don't do this, you will get an error message about not being able to
locate \f(CW\*(C`My::NonMoose\*(C'\fR in \f(CW@INC\fR. We hope that this case will be fairly rare.
.IP "The Class::Load wrapper functions in Class::MOP have been deprecated" 4
.IX Item "The Class::Load wrapper functions in Class::MOP have been deprecated"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Class::MOP::load_class\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Class::MOP::is_class_loaded\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`Class::MOP::load_first_existing_class\*(C'\fR have been deprecated. They have been
undocumented and discouraged since version 2.0200. You should replace their use
with the corresponding functions in Class::Load, or just use
Module::Runtime directly.
.ie n .IP "The non-arrayref forms of ""enum"" and ""duck_type"" have been deprecated" 4
.el .IP "The non-arrayref forms of \f(CWenum\fR and \f(CWduck_type\fR have been deprecated" 4
.IX Item "The non-arrayref forms of enum and duck_type have been deprecated"
Originally, \f(CW\*(C`enum\*(C'\fR could be called like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  enum(\*(AqMyType\*(Aq => qw(foo bar baz))
.Ve
.Sp
This was confusing, however (since it was different from the syntax for
anonymous enum types), and it makes error checking more difficult (since you
can't tell just by looking whether \f(CW\*(C`enum(\*(AqFoo\*(Aq, \*(AqBar\*(Aq, \*(AqBaz\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR was intended to
be a type named \f(CW\*(C`Foo\*(C'\fR with elements of \f(CW\*(C`Bar\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Baz\*(C'\fR, or if this was
actually a mistake where someone got the syntax for an anonymous enum type
wrong). This all also applies to \f(CW\*(C`duck_type\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Calling \f(CW\*(C`enum\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`duck_type\*(C'\fR with a list of arguments as described above
has been undocumented since version 0.93, and is now deprecated. You should
replace
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  enum MyType => qw(foo bar baz);
.Ve
.Sp
in your code with
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  enum MyType => [qw(foo bar baz)];
.Ve
.IP "Moose string exceptions have been replaced by Moose exception objects" 4
.IX Item "Moose string exceptions have been replaced by Moose exception objects"
Previously, Moose threw string exceptions on error conditions, which were not
so verbose. All those string exceptions have now been converted to exception
objects, which provide very detailed information about the exceptions. These
exception objects provide a string overload that matches the previous exception
message, so in most cases you should not have to change your code.
.Sp
For learning about the usage of Moose exception objects, read
Moose::Manual::Exceptions. Individual exceptions are documented in
Moose::Manual::Exceptions::Manifest.

.SH "2.1000"
.IX Header "2.1000"
.IP "The Num type is now stricter" 4
.IX Item "The Num type is now stricter"
The \f(CW\*(C`Num\*(C'\fR type used to accept anything that fits Perl's notion of a number,
which included Inf, NaN, and strings like \f(CW" 1234 \en"\fR.  We believe that the
type constraint should indicate \*(L"this is a number\*(R", not \*(L"this coerces to a
number\*(R".  Therefore, now Num accepts only integers, floating point numbers
(both in decimal notation and exponential notation), 0, .0, 0.0 etc.
.Sp
If you want the old behavior you can use the \f(CW\*(C`LaxNum\*(C'\fR type in
MooseX::Types::LaxNum.
.IP "You can use Specio instead of core Moose types" 4
.IX Item "You can use Specio instead of core Moose types"
The Specio distribution is an experimental new type system intended to
eventually replace the core Moose types, but yet also work with things like
Moo and Mouse and anything else. Right now this is all speculative, but
at least you can use Specio with Moose.
.SH "2.0600"
.IX Header "2.0600"
.ie n .IP """\->init_meta"" is even less reliable at loading extensions" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\->init_meta\fR is even less reliable at loading extensions" 4
.IX Item "->init_meta is even less reliable at loading extensions"
Previously, calling \f(CW\*(C`MooseX::Foo\->init_meta(@_)\*(C'\fR (and nothing else) from
within your own \f(CW\*(C`init_meta\*(C'\fR had a decent chance of doing something useful.
This was never supported behavior, and didn't always work anyway. Due to some
implementation adjustments, this now has a smaller chance of doing something
useful, which could break code that was expecting it to continue doing useful
things. Code that does this should instead just call
\&\f(CW\*(C`MooseX::Foo\->import({ into => $into })\*(C'\fR.
.IP "All the Cookbook recipes have been renamed" 4
.IX Item "All the Cookbook recipes have been renamed"
We've given them all descriptive names, rather than numbers. This makes it
easier to talk about them, and eliminates the need to renumber recipes in
order to reorder them or delete one.
.SH "2.0400"
.IX Header "2.0400"
.IP "The parent of a union type is its components' nearest common ancestor" 4
.IX Item "The parent of a union type is its components' nearest common ancestor"
Previously, union types considered all of their component types their parent
types. This was incorrect because parent types are defined as types that must
be satisfied in order for the child type to be satisfied, but in a union,
validating as any parent type will validate against the entire union. This has
been changed to find the nearest common ancestor for all of its components. For
example, a union of \*(L"Int|ArrayRef[Int]\*(R" now has a parent of \*(L"Defined\*(R".
.ie n .IP "Union types consider all members in the ""is_subtype_of"" and ""is_a_type_of"" methods" 4
.el .IP "Union types consider all members in the \f(CWis_subtype_of\fR and \f(CWis_a_type_of\fR methods" 4
.IX Item "Union types consider all members in the is_subtype_of and is_a_type_of methods"
Previously, a union type would report itself as being of a subtype of a type if
\&\fIany\fR of its member types were subtypes of that type. This was incorrect
because any value that passes a subtype constraint must also pass a parent
constraint. This has changed so that \fIall\fR of its member types must be a
subtype of the specified type.
.IP "Enum types now work with just one value" 4
.IX Item "Enum types now work with just one value"
Previously, an \f(CW\*(C`enum\*(C'\fR type needed to have two or more values.  Nobody knew
why, so we fixed it.
.IP "Methods defined in \s-1UNIVERSAL\s0 now appear in the \s-1MOP\s0" 4
.IX Item "Methods defined in UNIVERSAL now appear in the MOP"
Any method introspection methods that look at methods from parent classes now
find methods defined in \s-1UNIVERSAL.\s0 This includes methods like \f(CW\*(C`$class\->get_all_methods\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`$class\->find_method_by_name\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This also means that you can now apply method modifiers to these methods.
.IP "Hand-optimized type constraint code causes a deprecation warning" 4
.IX Item "Hand-optimized type constraint code causes a deprecation warning"
If you provide an optimized sub ref for a type constraint, this now causes a
deprecation warning. Typically, this comes from passing an \f(CW\*(C`optimize_as\*(C'\fR
parameter to \f(CW\*(C`subtype\*(C'\fR, but it could also happen if you create a
Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object directly.
.Sp
Use the inlining feature (\f(CW\*(C`inline_as\*(C'\fR) added in 2.0100 instead.
.ie n .IP """Class::Load::load_class"" and ""is_class_loaded"" have been removed" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWClass::Load::load_class\fR and \f(CWis_class_loaded\fR have been removed" 4
.IX Item "Class::Load::load_class and is_class_loaded have been removed"
The \f(CW\*(C`Class::MOP::load_class\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Class::MOP::is_class_loaded\*(C'\fR subroutines
are no longer documented, and will cause a deprecation warning in the
future. Moose now uses Class::Load to provide this functionality, and you
should do so as well.
.SH "2.0205"
.IX Header "2.0205"
.ie n .IP "Array and Hash native traits provide a ""shallow_clone"" method" 4
.el .IP "Array and Hash native traits provide a \f(CWshallow_clone\fR method" 4
.IX Item "Array and Hash native traits provide a shallow_clone method"
The Array and Hash native traits now provide a \*(L"shallow_clone\*(R" method, which
will return a reference to a new container with the same contents as the
attribute's reference.
.SH "2.0200"
.IX Header "2.0200"
.IP "Hand-optimized type constraint code is deprecated in favor of inlining" 4
.IX Item "Hand-optimized type constraint code is deprecated in favor of inlining"
Moose allows you to provide a hand-optimized version of a type constraint's
subroutine reference. This version allows type constraints to generate inline
code, and you should use this inlining instead of providing a hand-optimized
subroutine reference.
.Sp
This affects the \f(CW\*(C`optimize_as\*(C'\fR sub exported by
Moose::Util::TypeConstraints. Use \f(CW\*(C`inline_as\*(C'\fR instead.
.Sp
This will start warning in the 2.0300 release.
.SH "2.0002"
.IX Header "2.0002"
.IP "More useful type constraint error messages" 4
.IX Item "More useful type constraint error messages"
If you have Devel::PartialDump version 0.14 or higher installed, Moose's
type constraint error messages will use it to display the invalid value, rather
than just displaying it directly. This will generally be much more useful. For
instance, instead of this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Attribute (foo) does not pass the type constraint because: Validation failed for \*(AqArrayRef[Int]\*(Aq with value ARRAY(0x275eed8)
.Ve
.Sp
the error message will instead look like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Attribute (foo) does not pass the type constraint because: Validation failed for \*(AqArrayRef[Int]\*(Aq with value [ "a" ]
.Ve
.Sp
Note that Devel::PartialDump can't be made a direct dependency at the
moment, because it uses Moose itself, but we're considering options to make
this easier.
.SH "2.0000"
.IX Header "2.0000"
.IP "Roles have their own default attribute metaclass" 4
.IX Item "Roles have their own default attribute metaclass"
Previously, when a role was applied to a class, it would use the attribute
metaclass defined in the class when copying over the attributes in the role.
This was wrong, because for instance, using MooseX::FollowPBP in the class
would end up renaming all of the accessors generated by the role, some of which
may be being called in the role, causing it to break. Roles now keep track of
their own attribute metaclass to use by default when being applied to a class
(defaulting to Moose::Meta::Attribute). This is modifiable using
Moose::Util::MetaRole by passing the \f(CW\*(C`applied_attribute\*(C'\fR key to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`role_metaroles\*(C'\fR option, as in:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    Moose::Util::MetaRole::apply_metaroles(
\&        for => _\|_PACKAGE_\|_,
\&        class_metaroles => {
\&            attribute => [\*(AqMy::Meta::Role::Attribute\*(Aq],
\&        },
\&        role_metaroles => {
\&            applied_attribute => [\*(AqMy::Meta::Role::Attribute\*(Aq],
\&        },
\&    );
.Ve
.IP "Class::MOP has been folded into the Moose dist" 4
.IX Item "Class::MOP has been folded into the Moose dist"
Moose and Class::MOP are tightly related enough that they have always had to be
kept pretty closely in step in terms of versions. Making them into a single
dist should simplify the upgrade process for users, as it should no longer be
possible to upgrade one without the other and potentially cause issues. No
functionality has changed, and this should be entirely transparent.
.IP "Moose's conflict checking is more robust and useful" 4
.IX Item "Moose's conflict checking is more robust and useful"
There are two parts to this. The most useful one right now is that Moose will
ship with a \f(CW\*(C`moose\-outdated\*(C'\fR script, which can be run at any point to list the
modules which are installed that conflict with the installed version of Moose.
After upgrading Moose, running \f(CW\*(C`moose\-outdated | cpanm\*(C'\fR should be sufficient
to ensure that all of the Moose extensions you use will continue to work.
.Sp
The other part is that Moose's \f(CW\*(C`META.json\*(C'\fR file will also specify the
conflicts under the \f(CW\*(C`x_conflicts\*(C'\fR key. We are working with the Perl tool chain
developers to try to get conflicts support added to \s-1CPAN\s0 clients, and if/when
that happens, the metadata already exists, and so the conflict checking will
become automatic.
.IP "Most deprecated APIs/features are slated for removal in Moose 2.0200" 4
.IX Item "Most deprecated APIs/features are slated for removal in Moose 2.0200"
Most of the deprecated APIs and features in Moose will start throwing an error
in Moose 2.0200. Some of the features will go away entirely, and some will
simply throw an error.
.Sp
The things on the chopping block are:

Old public methods in Class::MOP and Moose
.Sp
This includes things like \f(CW\*(C`Class::MOP::Class\->get_attribute_map\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Class::MOP::Class\->construct_instance\*(C'\fR, and many others. These were
deprecated in Class::MOP 0.80_01, released on April 5, 2009.
.Sp
These methods will be removed entirely in Moose 2.0200.

New release policy
.Sp
As of the 2.0 release, Moose now has an official release and support policy,
documented in Moose::Manual::Support. All \s-1API\s0 changes will now go through a
deprecation cycle of at least one year, after which the deprecated \s-1API\s0 can be
removed. Deprecations and removals will only happen in major releases.
.Sp
In between major releases, we will still make minor releases to add new
features, fix bugs, update documentation, etc.

Classes which use the Moose::Error::Default error class can now have
stacktraces disabled by setting the \f(CW\*(C`MOOSE_ERROR_STYLE\*(C'\fR env var to \f(CW\*(C`croak\*(C'\fR.
This is experimental, fairly incomplete, and won't work in all cases (because
Moose's error system in general is all of these things), but this should allow
for reducing at least some of the verbosity in most cases.

.IX Header "1.15"
.IP "Native Delegations" 4
.IX Item "Native Delegations"
In previous versions of Moose, the Native delegations were created as
closures. The generated code was often quite slow compared to doing the same
thing by hand. For example, the Array's push delegation ended up doing
something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  push @{ $self\->$reader() }, @_;
.Ve
.Sp
If the attribute was created without a reader, the \f(CW$reader\fR sub reference
followed a very slow code path. Even with a reader, this is still slower than
it needs to be.
.Sp
Native delegations are now generated as inline code, just like other
accessors, so we can access the slot directly.
.Sp
In addition, native traits now do proper constraint checking in all cases. In
particular, constraint checking has been improved for array and hash
references. Previously, only the \fIcontained\fR type (the \f(CW\*(C`Str\*(C'\fR in
\&\f(CW\*(C`HashRef[Str]\*(C'\fR) would be checked when a new value was added to the
collection. However, if there was a constraint that applied to the whole
value, this was never checked.
.Sp
In addition, coercions are now called on the whole value.
.Sp
The delegation methods now do more argument checking. All of the methods check
that a valid number of arguments were passed to the method. In addition, the
delegation methods check that the arguments are sane (array indexes, hash
keys, numbers, etc.) when applicable. We have tried to emulate the behavior of
Perl builtins as much as possible.
.Sp
Finally, triggers are called whenever the value of the attribute is changed by
a Native delegation.
.Sp
These changes are only likely to break code in a few cases.
.Sp
The inlining code may or may not preserve the original reference when changes
are made. In some cases, methods which change the value may replace it
entirely. This will break tied values.
.Sp
If you have a typed arrayref or hashref attribute where the type enforces a
constraint on the whole collection, this constraint will now be checked. It's
possible that code which previously ran without errors will now cause the
constraint to fail. However, presumably this is a good thing ;)
.Sp
If you are passing invalid arguments to a delegation which were previously
being ignored, these calls will now fail.
.Sp
If your code relied on the trigger only being called for a regular writer,
that may cause problems.
.Sp
As always, you are encouraged to test before deploying the latest version of
Moose to production.
.IP "Defaults is and default for String, Counter, and Bool" 4
.IX Item "Defaults is and default for String, Counter, and Bool"
A few native traits (String, Counter, Bool) provide default values of \*(L"is\*(R" and
\&\*(L"default\*(R" when you created an attribute. Allowing them to provide these values
is now deprecated. Supply the value yourself when creating the attribute.
.ie n .IP "The ""meta"" method" 4
.el .IP "The \f(CWmeta\fR method" 4
.IX Item "The meta method"
Moose and Class::MOP have been cleaned up internally enough to make the
\&\f(CW\*(C`meta\*(C'\fR method that you get by default optional. \f(CW\*(C`use Moose\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`use Moose::Role\*(C'\fR now can take an additional \f(CW\*(C`\-meta_name\*(C'\fR option, which
tells Moose what name to use when installing the \f(CW\*(C`meta\*(C'\fR method. Passing
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR to this option suppresses generation of the \f(CW\*(C`meta\*(C'\fR method
entirely. This should be useful for users of modules which also use a \f(CW\*(C`meta\*(C'\fR
method or function, such as Curses or Rose::DB::Object.

Previously, deprecation mostly consisted of simply saying \*(L"X is deprecated\*(R" in
the Changes file. We were not very consistent about actually warning. Now, all
deprecated features still present in Moose actually give a warning. The
warning is issued once per calling package. See Moose::Deprecated for more
details.

Previously, this was accepted, and it sort of worked, except that if you
attempted to set the attribute after the object was created, you would get a
runtime error.
.Sp
Now you will get a warning when you attempt to define the attribute.

.IX Item "no Moose, no Moose::Role, and no Moose::Exporter no longer unimport strict and warnings"
This change was made in 1.05, and has now been reverted. We don't know if the
user has explicitly loaded strict or warnings on their own, and unimporting
them is just broken in that case.
.IP "Reversed logic when defining which options can be changed" 4
.IX Item "Reversed logic when defining which options can be changed"
Moose::Meta::Attribute now allows all options to be changed in an
overridden attribute. The previous behaviour required each option to be
whitelisted using the \f(CW\*(C`legal_options_for_inheritance\*(C'\fR method. This method has
been removed, and there is a new method, \f(CW\*(C`illegal_options_for_inheritance\*(C'\fR,
which can now be used to prevent certain options from being changeable.
.Sp
In addition, we only throw an error if the illegal option is actually
changed. If the superclass didn't specify this option at all when defining the
attribute, the subclass version can still add it as an option.
.Sp
Example of overriding this in an attribute trait:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  package Bar::Meta::Attribute;
\&  use Moose::Role;
\&
\&  has \*(Aqmy_illegal_option\*(Aq => (
\&      isa => \*(AqCodeRef\*(Aq,

The metaclass compatibility checking

inheritance and with custom metaclasses for things like attributes,
constructors, etc. For correct code, the only thing that should require a
change is that custom error metaclasses must now inherit from

This is dangerous because modifying a class after a subclass has been
immutabilized will lead to incorrect results in the subclass, due to inlining,
caching, etc. This occasionally happens accidentally, when a class loads one
of its subclasses in the middle of its class definition, so pointing out that
this may cause issues should be helpful. Metaclasses (classes that inherit
from Class::MOP::Object) are currently exempt from this check, since at the
moment we aren't very consistent about which metaclasses we immutabilize.

Previously, calling these functions with a list would take the first element of
the list as the type constraint name, and use the remainder as the enum values
or method names. This makes the interface inconsistent with the anon-type forms
of these functions (which must take an arrayref), and a free-form list where
the first value is sometimes special is hard to validate (and harder to give
reasonable error messages for). These functions have been changed to take
arrayrefs in all their forms \- so, \f(CW\*(C`enum \*(AqMy::Type\*(Aq => [qw(foo bar)]\*(C'\fR is
now the preferred way to create an enum type constraint. The old syntax still
works for now, but it will hopefully be deprecated and removed in a future

The \f(CW\*(C`provides\*(C'\fR syntax was like core Moose \f(CW\*(C`handles => HASHREF\*(C'\fR
syntax, but with the keys and values reversed.  This was confusing,
and AttributeHelpers now uses \f(CW\*(C`handles => HASHREF\*(C'\fR in a way that
should be intuitive to anyone already familiar with how it is used for
other attributes.

The \f(CW\*(C`curries\*(C'\fR functionality provided by AttributeHelpers has been

can easily mask real errors.
.SH "0.71_01"
.IX Header "0.71_01"
Calling \f(CW\*(C`type\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`subtype\*(C'\fR without the sugar helpers (\f(CW\*(C`as\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`where\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`message\*(C'\fR) is now deprecated.
.PP
As a side effect, this meant we ended up using Perl prototypes on
\&\f(CW\*(C`as\*(C'\fR, and code like this will no longer work:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;
\&  use Declare::Constraints::Simple \-All;
\&
\&  subtype \*(AqArrayOfInts\*(Aq
\&      => as \*(AqArrayRef\*(Aq
\&      => IsArrayRef(IsInt);
.Ve
.PP
Instead it must be changed to this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  subtype(
\&      \*(AqArrayOfInts\*(Aq => {
\&          as    => \*(AqArrayRef\*(Aq,
\&          where => IsArrayRef(IsInt)
\&      }
\&  );
.Ve
.PP
If you want to maintain backwards compat with older versions of Moose,
you must explicitly test Moose's \f(CW\*(C`VERSION\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  if ( Moose\->VERSION < 0.71_01 ) {
\&      subtype \*(AqArrayOfInts\*(Aq
\&          => as \*(AqArrayRef\*(Aq
\&          => IsArrayRef(IsInt);
\&  }
\&  else {
\&      subtype(
\&          \*(AqArrayOfInts\*(Aq => {
\&              as    => \*(AqArrayRef\*(Aq,
\&              where => IsArrayRef(IsInt)
\&          }
\&      );
\&  }
.Ve
.SH "0.70"
.IX Header "0.70"
We no longer pass the meta-attribute object as a final argument to
triggers. This actually changed for inlined code a while back, but the
non-inlined version and the docs were still out of date.
.PP
If by some chance you actually used this feature, the workaround is
simple. You fetch the attribute object from out of the \f(CW$self\fR
that is passed as the first argument to trigger, like so:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  has \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq => (
\&      is      => \*(Aqro\*(Aq,
\&      isa     => \*(AqAny\*(Aq,
\&      trigger => sub {
\&          my ( $self, $value ) = @_;
\&          my $attr = $self\->meta\->find_attribute_by_name(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq);
\&
\&          # ...
\&      }
\&  );
.Ve
.SH "0.66"
.IX Header "0.66"
If you created a subtype and passed a parent that Moose didn't know
about, it simply ignored the parent. Now it automatically creates the
parent as a class type. This may not be what you want, but is less
broken than before.
.PP
You could declare a name with subtype such as \*(L"Foo!Bar\*(R". Moose would
accept this allowed, but if you used it in a parameterized type such
as \*(L"ArrayRef[Foo!Bar]\*(R" it wouldn't work. We now do some vetting on
names created via the sugar functions, so that they can only contain
alphanumerics, \*(L":\*(R", and \*(L".\*(R".
.SH "0.65"
.IX Header "0.65"
Methods created via an attribute can now fulfill a \f(CW\*(C`requires\*(C'\fR
declaration for a role. Honestly we don't know why Stevan didn't make
this work originally, he was just insane or something.
.PP
Stack traces from inlined code will now report the line and file as
being in your class, as opposed to in Moose guts.
.SH "0.62_02"
.IX Header "0.62_02"
When a class does not provide all of a role's required methods, the
error thrown now mentions all of the missing methods, as opposed to
just the first missing method.
.PP
Moose will no longer inline a constructor for your class unless it
inherits its constructor from Moose::Object, and will warn when it
doesn't inline. If you want to force inlining anyway, pass
\&\f(CW\*(C`replace_constructor => 1\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`make_immutable\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If you want to get rid of the warning, pass \f(CW\*(C`inline_constructor =>
0\*(C'\fR.
.SH "0.62"
.IX Header "0.62"
Removed the (deprecated) \f(CW\*(C`make_immutable\*(C'\fR keyword.
.PP
Removing an attribute from a class now also removes delegation
(\f(CW\*(C`handles\*(C'\fR) methods installed for that attribute. This is correct
behavior, but if you were wrongly relying on it you might get bit.
.SH "0.58"
.IX Header "0.58"
Roles now add methods by calling \f(CW\*(C`add_method\*(C'\fR, not
\&\f(CW\*(C`alias_method\*(C'\fR. They make sure to always provide a method object,
which will be cloned internally. This means that it is now possible to
track the source of a method provided by a role, and even follow its
history through intermediate roles.  This means that methods added by
a role now show up when looking at a class's method list/map.
.PP
Parameter and Union args are now sorted, this makes Int|Str the same
constraint as Str|Int. Also, incoming type constraint strings are
normalized to remove all whitespace differences. This is mostly for
internals and should not affect outside code.
.PP
Moose::Exporter will no longer remove a subroutine that the
exporting package re-exports. Moose re-exports the Carp::confess
function, among others. The reasoning is that we cannot know whether
you have also explicitly imported those functions for your own use, so
we err on the safe side and always keep them.
.SH "0.56"
.IX Header "0.56"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Moose::init_meta\*(C'\fR should now be called as a method.
.PP
New modules for extension writers, Moose::Exporter and
Moose::Util::MetaRole.
.SH "0.55_01"
.IX Header "0.55_01"
Implemented metaclass traits (and wrote a recipe for it):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Moose \-traits => \*(AqFoo\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
This should make writing small Moose extensions a little
easier.
.SH "0.55"
.IX Header "0.55"
Fixed \f(CW\*(C`coerce\*(C'\fR to accept anon types just like \f(CW\*(C`subtype\*(C'\fR can.
So that you can do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  coerce $some_anon_type => from \*(AqStr\*(Aq => via { ... };
.Ve
.SH "0.51"
.IX Header "0.51"
Added \f(CW\*(C`BUILDARGS\*(C'\fR, a new step in \f(CW\*(C`Moose::Object\->new()\*(C'\fR.
.SH "0.49"
.IX Header "0.49"
Fixed how the \f(CW\*(C`is => (ro|rw)\*(C'\fR works with custom defined
\&\f(CW\*(C`reader\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`writer\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`accessor\*(C'\fR options. See the below table for
details:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  is => ro, writer => _foo    # turns into (reader => foo, writer => _foo)
\&  is => rw, writer => _foo    # turns into (reader => foo, writer => _foo)
\&  is => rw, accessor => _foo  # turns into (accessor => _foo)
\&  is => ro, accessor => _foo  # error, accesor is rw
.Ve
.SH "0.45"
.IX Header "0.45"
The \f(CW\*(C`before/around/after\*(C'\fR method modifiers now support regexp
matching of method names. \s-1NOTE:\s0 this only works for classes, it is
currently not supported in roles, but, ... patches welcome.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`has\*(C'\fR keyword for roles now accepts the same array ref form that
Moose.pm does for classes.
.PP
A trigger on a read-only attribute is no longer an error, as it's
useful to trigger off of the constructor.
.PP
Subtypes of parameterizable types now are parameterizable types
themselves.
.SH "0.44"
.IX Header "0.44"
Fixed issue where \f(CW\*(C`DEMOLISHALL\*(C'\fR was eating the value in \f(CW$@\fR, and so
not working correctly. It still kind of eats them, but so does vanilla
perl.
.SH "0.41"
.IX Header "0.41"
Inherited attributes may now be extended without restriction on the
type ('isa', 'does').
.PP
The entire set of Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::* classes were
refactored in this release. If you were relying on their internals you
should test your code carefully.
.SH "0.40"
.IX Header "0.40"
Documenting the use of '+name' with attributes that come from recently
composed roles. It makes sense, people are using it, and so why not
just officially support it.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Moose::Meta::Class\->create\*(C'\fR method now supports roles.
.PP
It is now possible to make anonymous enum types by passing \f(CW\*(C`enum\*(C'\fR an
array reference instead of the \f(CW\*(C`enum $name => @values\*(C'\fR.
.SH "0.37"
.IX Header "0.37"
Added the \f(CW\*(C`make_immutable\*(C'\fR keyword as a shortcut to calling
\&\f(CW\*(C`make_immutable\*(C'\fR on the meta object. This eventually got removed!
.PP
Made \f(CW\*(C`init_arg => undef\*(C'\fR work in Moose. This means \*(L"do not accept
a constructor parameter for this attribute\*(R".
.PP
Type errors now use the provided message. Prior to this release they
didn't.
.SH "0.34"
.IX Header "0.34"
Moose is now a postmodern object system :)
.PP
The Role system was completely refactored. It is 100% backwards
compat, but the internals were totally changed. If you relied on the
internals then you are advised to test carefully.
.PP
Added method exclusion and aliasing for Roles in this release.
.PP
Added the Moose::Util::TypeConstraints::OptimizedConstraints
module.
.PP
Passing a list of values to an accessor (which is only expecting one
value) used to be silently ignored, now it throws an error.
.SH "0.26"
.IX Header "0.26"
Added parameterized types and did a pretty heavy refactoring of the
type constraint system.
.PP
Better framework extensibility and better support for \*(L"making your own
Moose\*(R".
.SH "0.25 or before"
.IX Header "0.25 or before"
Honestly, you shouldn't be using versions of Moose that are this old,
so many bug fixes and speed improvements have been made you would be
crazy to not upgrade.
.PP
Also, I am tired of going through the Changelog so I am stopping here,
if anyone would like to continue this please feel free.

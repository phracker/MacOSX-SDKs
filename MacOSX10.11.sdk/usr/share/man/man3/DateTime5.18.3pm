.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
DateTime is a class for the representation of date/time combinations,
and is part of the Perl DateTime project. For details on this project
please see <http://datetime.perl.org/>. The DateTime site has a \s-1FAQ\s0
which may help answer many \*(L"how do I do X?\*(R" questions. The \s-1FAQ\s0 is at
<http://datetime.perl.org/wiki/datetime/page/FAQ>.
.PP
It represents the Gregorian calendar, extended backwards in time
before its creation (in 1582). This is sometimes known as the
\&\*(L"proleptic Gregorian calendar\*(R". In this calendar, the first day of
the calendar (the epoch), is the first day of year 1, which
corresponds to the date which was (incorrectly) believed to be the
birth of Jesus Christ.
.PP
The calendar represented does have a year 0, and in that way differs
from how dates are often written using \*(L"\s-1BCE/CE\*(R"\s0 or \*(L"\s-1BC/AD\*(R".\s0
.PP
For infinite datetimes, please see the
DateTime::Infinite module.
.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
.SS "0\-based Versus 1\-based Numbers"
.IX Subsection "0-based Versus 1-based Numbers"
The DateTime.pm module follows a simple consistent logic for
determining whether or not a given number is 0\-based or 1\-based.
.PP
Month, day of month, day of week, and day of year are 1\-based. Any
method that is 1\-based also has an equivalent 0\-based method ending in
\&\*(L"_0\*(R". So for example, this class provides both \f(CW\*(C`day_of_week()\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`day_of_week_0()\*(C'\fR methods.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`day_of_week_0()\*(C'\fR method still treats Monday as the first day of
the week.
.PP
All \fItime\fR\-related numbers such as hour, minute, and second are
0\-based.
.PP
Years are neither, as they can be both positive or negative, unlike
any other datetime component. There \fIis\fR a year 0.
.PP
There is no \f(CW\*(C`quarter_0()\*(C'\fR method.
.SS "Error Handling"
.IX Subsection "Error Handling"
Some errors may cause this module to die with an error string. This
can only happen when calling constructor methods, methods that change
the object, such as \f(CW\*(C`set()\*(C'\fR, or methods that take parameters.
Methods that retrieve information about the object, such as \f(CW\*(C`year()\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`epoch()\*(C'\fR, will never die.
.SS "Locales"
.IX Subsection "Locales"
All the object methods which return names or abbreviations return data
based on a locale. This is done by setting the locale when
constructing a DateTime object. There is also a \f(CW\*(C`DefaultLocale()\*(C'\fR
class method which may be used to set the default locale for all
DateTime objects created. If this is not set, then \*(L"en_US\*(R" is used.
.SS "Floating DateTimes"
.IX Subsection "Floating DateTimes"
The default time zone for new DateTime objects, except where stated
otherwise, is the \*(L"floating\*(R" time zone. This concept comes from the
iCal standard. A floating datetime is one which is not anchored to
any particular time zone. In addition, floating datetimes do not
include leap seconds, since we cannot apply them without knowing the
datetime's time zone.
.PP
The results of date math and comparison between a floating datetime
and one with a real time zone are not really valid, because one
includes leap seconds and the other does not. Similarly, the results
of datetime math between two floating datetimes and two datetimes with
time zones are not really comparable.
.PP
If you are planning to use any objects with a real time zone, it is
strongly recommended that you \fBdo not\fR mix these with floating
datetimes.
.SS "Math"
.IX Subsection "Math"
If you are going to be using doing date math, please read the section \*(L"How
DateTime Math Works\*(R".
.SS "Time Zone Warnings"
.IX Subsection "Time Zone Warnings"
Determining the local time zone for a system can be slow. If \f(CW$ENV{TZ}\fR is
not set, it may involve reading a number of files in \fI/etc\fR or elsewhere. If
you know that the local time zone won't change while your code is running, and
you need to make many objects for the local time zone, it is strongly
recommended that you retrieve the local time zone once and cache it:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  our $App::LocalTZ = DateTime::TimeZone\->new( name => \*(Aqlocal\*(Aq );
\&
\&  ... # then everywhere else
\&
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->new( ..., time_zone => $App::LocalTZ );
.Ve
.PP
DateTime itself does not do this internally because local time zones can
change, and there's no good way to determine if it's changed without doing all
the work to look it up.
.PP
Do not try to use named time zones (like \*(L"America/Chicago\*(R") with dates
very far in the future (thousands of years). The current
implementation of \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\*(C'\fR will use a huge amount of
memory calculating all the \s-1DST\s0 changes from now until the future
date. Use \s-1UTC\s0 or the floating time zone and you will be safe.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
DateTime provide many methods. The documentation breaks them down into groups
based on what they do (constructor, accessors, modifiers, etc.).
.SS "Constructors"
.IX Subsection "Constructors"
All constructors can die when invalid parameters are given.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->new( ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->new( ... )"
.PP
This class method accepts parameters for each date and time component:
\&\*(L"year\*(R", \*(L"month\*(R", \*(L"day\*(R", \*(L"hour\*(R", \*(L"minute\*(R", \*(L"second\*(R", \*(L"nanosecond\*(R".
It also accepts \*(L"locale\*(R", \*(L"time_zone\*(R", and \*(L"formatter\*(R" parameters.
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->new(
\&      year       => 1966,
\&      month      => 10,
\&      day        => 25,
\&      hour       => 7,
\&      minute     => 15,
\&      second     => 47,
\&      nanosecond => 500000000,
\&      time_zone  => \*(AqAmerica/Chicago\*(Aq,
\&  );
.Ve
.PP
DateTime validates the \*(L"month\*(R", \*(L"day\*(R", \*(L"hour\*(R", \*(L"minute\*(R", and \*(L"second\*(R",
and \*(L"nanosecond\*(R" parameters. The valid values for these parameters are:
.IP "\(bu" 8
month
.Sp
An integer from 1\-12.
.IP "\(bu" 8
day
.Sp
An integer from 1\-31, and it must be within the valid range of days for the
specified month.
.IP "\(bu" 8
hour
.Sp
An integer from 0\-23.
.IP "\(bu" 8
minute
.Sp
An integer from 0\-59.
.IP "\(bu" 8
second
.Sp
An integer from 0\-61 (to allow for leap seconds). Values of 60 or 61 are only
allowed when they match actual leap seconds.
.IP "\(bu" 8
nanosecond
.Sp
An integer >= 0. If this number is greater than 1 billion, it will be
normalized into the second value for the DateTime object.
.PP
Invalid parameter types (like an array reference) will cause the
constructor to die.
.PP
The value for seconds may be from 0 to 61, to account for leap
seconds. If you give a value greater than 59, DateTime does check to
see that it really matches a valid leap second.
.PP
All of the parameters are optional except for \*(L"year\*(R". The \*(L"month\*(R" and
\&\*(L"day\*(R" parameters both default to 1, while the \*(L"hour\*(R", \*(L"minute\*(R",
\&\*(L"second\*(R", and \*(L"nanosecond\*(R" parameters all default to 0.
.PP
The \*(L"locale\*(R" parameter should be a string matching one of the valid
locales, or a \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::Locale\*(C'\fR object. See the
DateTime::Locale documentation for details.
.PP
The time_zone parameter can be either a scalar or a
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\*(C'\fR object. A string will simply be passed to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\->new\*(C'\fR method as its \*(L"name\*(R" parameter. This
string may be an Olson \s-1DB\s0 time zone name (\*(L"America/Chicago\*(R"), an
offset string (\*(L"+0630\*(R"), or the words \*(L"floating\*(R" or \*(L"local\*(R". See the
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\*(C'\fR documentation for more details.
.PP
The default time zone is \*(L"floating\*(R".
.PP
The \*(L"formatter\*(R" can be either a scalar or an object, but the class
specified by the scalar or the object must implement a
\&\f(CW\*(C`format_datetime()\*(C'\fR method.
.PP
Parsing Dates
.IX Subsection "Parsing Dates"
.PP
\&\fBThis module does not parse dates!\fR That means there is no
constructor to which you can pass things like \*(L"March 3, 1970 12:34\*(R".
.PP
Instead, take a look at the various \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::Format::*\*(C'\fR modules on
\&\s-1CPAN.\s0 These parse all sorts of different date formats, and you're
bound to find something that can handle your particular needs.
.PP
Ambiguous Local Times
.IX Subsection "Ambiguous Local Times"
.PP
Because of Daylight Saving Time, it is possible to specify a local
time that is ambiguous. For example, in the \s-1US\s0 in 2003, the
transition from to saving to standard time occurred on October 26, at
02:00:00 local time. The local clock changed from 01:59:59 (saving
time) to 01:00:00 (standard time). This means that the hour from
01:00:00 through 01:59:59 actually occurs twice, though the \s-1UTC\s0 time
continues to move forward.
.PP
If you specify an ambiguous time, then the latest \s-1UTC\s0 time is always
used, in effect always choosing standard time. In this case, you can
simply subtract an hour to the object in order to move to saving time,
for example:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  # This object represent 01:30:00 standard time
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->new(
\&      year      => 2003,
\&      month     => 10,
\&      day       => 26,
\&      hour      => 1,
\&      minute    => 30,
\&      second    => 0,
\&      time_zone => \*(AqAmerica/Chicago\*(Aq,
\&  );
\&
\&  print $dt\->hms;  # prints 01:30:00
\&
\&  # Now the object represent 01:30:00 saving time
\&  $dt\->subtract( hours => 1 );
\&
\&  print $dt\->hms;  # still prints 01:30:00
.Ve
.PP
Alternately, you could create the object with the \s-1UTC\s0 time zone, and
then call the \f(CW\*(C`set_time_zone()\*(C'\fR method to change the time zone. This
is a good way to ensure that the time is not ambiguous.
.PP
Invalid Local Times
.IX Subsection "Invalid Local Times"
.PP
Another problem introduced by Daylight Saving Time is that certain
local times just do not exist. For example, in the \s-1US\s0 in 2003, the
transition from standard to saving time occurred on April 6, at the
change to 2:00:00 local time. The local clock changes from 01:59:59
(standard time) to 03:00:00 (saving time). This means that there is
no 02:00:00 through 02:59:59 on April 6!
.PP
Attempting to create an invalid time currently causes a fatal error.
This may change in future version of this module.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->from_epoch( epoch => \f(CI$epoch\fI, ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->from_epoch( epoch => $epoch, ... )"
.PP
This class method can be used to construct a new DateTime object from
an epoch time instead of components. Just as with the \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR
method, it accepts \*(L"time_zone\*(R", \*(L"locale\*(R", and \*(L"formatter\*(R" parameters.
.PP
If the epoch value is not an integer, the part after the decimal will
be converted to nanoseconds. This is done in order to be compatible
with \f(CW\*(C`Time::HiRes\*(C'\fR. If the floating portion extends past 9 decimal
places, it will be truncated to nine, so that 1.1234567891 will become
1 second and 123,456,789 nanoseconds.
.PP
By default, the returned object will be in the \s-1UTC\s0 time zone.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->now( ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->now( ... )"
.PP
This class method is equivalent to calling \f(CW\*(C`from_epoch()\*(C'\fR with the
value returned from Perl's \f(CW\*(C`time()\*(C'\fR function. Just as with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR method, it accepts \*(L"time_zone\*(R" and \*(L"locale\*(R" parameters.
.PP
By default, the returned object will be in the \s-1UTC\s0 time zone.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->today( ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->today( ... )"
.PP
This class method is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  DateTime\->now(@_)\->truncate( to => \*(Aqday\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
\fIDateTime\->from_object( object => \f(CI$object\fI, ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->from_object( object => $object, ... )"
.PP
This class method can be used to construct a new DateTime object from
any object that implements the \f(CW\*(C`utc_rd_values()\*(C'\fR method. All
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime::Calendar\*(C'\fR modules must implement this method in order to
provide cross-calendar compatibility. This method accepts a
\&\*(L"locale\*(R" and \*(L"formatter\*(R" parameter
.PP
If the object passed to this method has a \f(CW\*(C`time_zone()\*(C'\fR method, that
is used to set the time zone of the newly created \f(CW\*(C`DateTime.pm\*(C'\fR
object.
.PP
Otherwise, the returned object will be in the floating time zone.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->last_day_of_month( ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->last_day_of_month( ... )"
.PP
This constructor takes the same arguments as can be given to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR method, except for \*(L"day\*(R". Additionally, both \*(L"year\*(R" and
\&\*(L"month\*(R" are required.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->from_day_of_year( ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->from_day_of_year( ... )"
.PP

Return the \s-1UTC\s0 epoch value for the datetime object. Internally, this
is implemented using \f(CW\*(C`Time::Local\*(C'\fR, which uses the Unix epoch even on
machines with a different epoch (such as MacOS). Datetimes before the

\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->truncate( to => ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->truncate( to => ... )"
.PP
This method allows you to reset some of the local time components in the
object to their \*(L"zero\*(R" values. The \*(L"to\*(R" parameter is used to specify which
values to truncate, and it may be one of \*(L"year\*(R", \*(L"month\*(R", \*(L"week\*(R", \*(L"local_week\*(R"
\&\*(L"day\*(R", \*(L"hour\*(R", \*(L"minute\*(R", or \*(L"second\*(R". For example, if \*(L"month\*(R" is specified,
then the local day becomes 1, and the hour, minute, and second all become 0.
.PP
If \*(L"week\*(R" is given, then the datetime is set to the Monday of the week in
which it occurs, and the time components are all set to 0. If you truncate to
\&\*(L"local_week\*(R", then the first day of the week is locale-dependent. For example,
in the \f(CW\*(C`en_US\*(C'\fR locale, the first day of the week is Sunday.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->set_time_zone( \f(CI$tz\fI )\fR

.PP
This method accepts either a time zone object or a string that can be
passed as the \*(L"name\*(R" parameter to \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\->new()\*(C'\fR.
If the new time zone's offset is different from the old time zone,
then the \fIlocal\fR time is adjusted accordingly.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->new(

\&
\&  $dt\->set_time_zone( \*(AqAmerica/Chicago\*(Aq );
\&

.Ve
.PP
If the old time zone was a floating time zone, then no adjustments to
the local time are made, except to account for leap seconds. If the
new time zone is floating, then the \fI\s-1UTC\s0\fR time is adjusted in order
to leave the local time untouched.

This method returns a new \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::Duration\*(C'\fR object representing
the difference between the two dates. The duration is \fBrelative\fR to
the object from which \f(CW$datetime\fR is subtracted. For example:
.PP

.Ve
.PP
Note that this duration is not an absolute measure of the amount of
time between the two datetimes, because the length of a month varies,
as well as due to the presence of leap seconds.

The returned duration may have deltas for months, days, minutes,
seconds, and nanoseconds.

.IX Subsection "$dt->delta_days( $datetime )"
.PP
Each of these methods returns a new \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::Duration\*(C'\fR object
representing some portion of the difference between two datetimes.
The \f(CW\*(C`delta_md()\*(C'\fR method returns a duration which contains only the
month and day portions of the duration is represented. The

.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`delta_md\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`delta_days\*(C'\fR methods truncate the duration so
that any fractional portion of a day is ignored. Both of these
methods operate on the date portion of a datetime only, and so
effectively ignore the time zone.

Compare two DateTime objects. The semantics are compatible with Perl's
\&\f(CW\*(C`sort()\*(C'\fR function; it returns \-1 if \f(CW$dt1\fR < \f(CW$dt2\fR, 0 if \f(CW$dt1\fR == \f(CW$dt2\fR, 1 if \f(CW$dt1\fR
> \f(CW$dt2\fR.
.PP
If one of the two DateTime objects has a floating time zone, it will
first be converted to the time zone of the other object. This is what
you want most of the time, but it can lead to inconsistent results
when you compare a number of DateTime objects, some of which are
floating, and some of which are in other time zones.
.PP
If you want to have consistent results (because you want to sort a
number of objects, for example), you can use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`compare_ignore_floating()\*(C'\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @dates = sort { DateTime\->compare_ignore_floating($a, $b) } @dates;
.Ve
.PP
In this case, objects with a floating time zone will be sorted as if
they were \s-1UTC\s0 times.
.PP
Since DateTime objects overload comparison operators, this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @dates = sort @dates;
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @dates = sort { DateTime\->compare($a, $b) } @dates;

DateTime objects can be compared to any other calendar class that
implements the \f(CW\*(C`utc_rd_values()\*(C'\fR method.

.PP
If you want to simplify your life and not have to think too hard about
the nitty-gritty of datetime math, I have several recommendations:
.IP "\(bu" 4
use the floating time zone
.Sp
If you do not care about time zones or leap seconds, use the
\&\*(L"floating\*(R" timezone:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->now( time_zone => \*(Aqfloating\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
Math done on two objects in the floating time zone produces very
predictable results.
.Sp
Note that in most cases you will want to start by creating an object in a
specific zone and \fIthen\fR convert it to the floating time zone. When an object
goes from a real zone to the floating zone, the time for the object remains
the same.
.Sp
This means that passing the floating zone to a constructor may not do what you
want.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->now( time_zone => \*(Aqfloating\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
is equivalent to
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->now( time_zone => \*(AqUTC\*(Aq )\->set_time_zone(\*(Aqfloating\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
This might not be what you wanted. Instead, you may prefer to do this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->now( time_zone => \*(Aqlocal\*(Aq )\->set_time_zone(\*(Aqfloating\*(Aq);
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
use \s-1UTC\s0 for all calculations
.Sp
If you do care about time zones (particularly \s-1DST\s0) or leap seconds,
try to use non-UTC time zones for presentation and user input only.
Convert to \s-1UTC\s0 immediately and convert back to the local time zone for
presentation:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->new( %user_input, time_zone => $user_tz );
\&  $dt\->set_time_zone(\*(AqUTC\*(Aq);
\&
\&  # do various operations \- store it, retrieve it, add, subtract, etc.
\&
\&  $dt\->set_time_zone($user_tz);
\&  print $dt\->datetime;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
math on non-UTC time zones
.Sp
If you need to do date math on objects with non-UTC time zones, please
read the caveats below carefully. The results \f(CW\*(C`DateTime.pm\*(C'\fR produces are
predictable and correct, and mostly intuitive, but datetime math gets
very ugly when time zones are involved, and there are a few strange
corner cases involving subtraction of two datetimes across a \s-1DST\s0
change.
.Sp
If you can always use the floating or \s-1UTC\s0 time zones, you can skip
ahead to Leap Seconds and Date Math
.IP "\(bu" 4
date vs datetime math
.Sp
If you only care about the date (calendar) portion of a datetime, you
should use either \f(CW\*(C`delta_md()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`delta_days()\*(C'\fR, not
\&\f(CW\*(C`subtract_datetime()\*(C'\fR. This will give predictable, unsurprising
results, free from DST-related complications.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIsubtract_datetime()\fR and \fIadd_duration()\fR
.Sp
You must convert your datetime objects to the \s-1UTC\s0 time zone before
doing date math if you want to make sure that the following formulas
are always true:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  $dt2 \- $dt1 = $dur
\&  $dt1 + $dur = $dt2
\&  $dt2 \- $dur = $dt1
.Ve
.Sp
Note that using \f(CW\*(C`delta_days\*(C'\fR ensures that this formula always works,
regardless of the timezone of the objects involved, as does using
\&\f(CW\*(C`subtract_datetime_absolute()\*(C'\fR. Other methods of subtraction are not
always reversible.
.PP
\fIAdding a Duration to a Datetime\fR
.IX Subsection "Adding a Duration to a Datetime"
.PP
The parts of a duration can be broken down into five parts. These are
months, days, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds. Adding one month to
a date is different than adding 4 weeks or 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
Similarly, due to \s-1DST\s0 and leap seconds, adding a day can be different
than adding 86,400 seconds, and adding a minute is not exactly the
same as 60 seconds.
.PP
We cannot convert between these units, except for seconds and
nanoseconds, because there is no fixed conversion between the two
units, because of things like leap seconds, \s-1DST\s0 changes, etc.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime.pm\*(C'\fR always adds (or subtracts) days, then months, minutes, and then
seconds and nanoseconds. If there are any boundary overflows, these are
normalized at each step. For the days and months the local (not \s-1UTC\s0) values
are used. For minutes and seconds, the local values are used. This generally
just works.
.PP
This means that adding one month and one day to February 28, 2003 will
produce the date April 1, 2003, not March 29, 2003.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->new( year => 2003, month => 2, day => 28 );
\&
\&  $dt\->add( months => 1, days => 1 );
\&
\&  # 2003\-04\-01 \- the result
.Ve
.PP
On the other hand, if we add months first, and then separately add
days, we end up with March 29, 2003:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dt\->add( months => 1 )\->add( days => 1 );
\&
\&  # 2003\-03\-29
.Ve
.PP
We see similar strangeness when math crosses a \s-1DST\s0 boundary:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->new(
\&      year      => 2003,
\&      month     => 4,
\&      day       => 5,
\&      hour      => 1,
\&      minute    => 58,
\&      time_zone => "America/Chicago",
\&  );
\&
\&  $dt\->add( days => 1, minutes => 3 );
\&  # 2003\-04\-06 02:01:00
\&
\&  $dt\->add( minutes => 3 )\->add( days => 1 );
\&  # 2003\-04\-06 03:01:00
.Ve
.PP
Note that if you converted the datetime object to \s-1UTC\s0 first you would
get predictable results.
.PP
If you want to know how many seconds a duration object represents, you
have to add it to a datetime to find out, so you could do:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& my $now = DateTime\->now( time_zone => \*(AqUTC\*(Aq );
\& my $later = $now\->clone\->add_duration($duration);
\&
\& my $seconds_dur = $later\->subtract_datetime_absolute($now);
.Ve
.PP
This returns a duration which only contains seconds and nanoseconds.
.PP
If we were add the duration to a different datetime object we might
get a different number of seconds.
.PP
DateTime::Duration supports three different end-of-month algorithms for
adding months. This comes into play when an addition results in a day past the
end of the month (for example, adding one month to January 30).
.PP
.Vb 2
\& # 2010\-08\-31 + 1 month = 2010\-10\-01
\& $dt\->add( months => 1, end_of_month => \*(Aqwrap\*(Aq );
\&
\& # 2010\-01\-30 + 1 month = 2010\-02\-28
\& $dt\->add( months => 1, end_of_month => \*(Aqlimit\*(Aq );
\&
\& # 2010\-04\-30 + 1 month = 2010\-05\-31
\& $dt\->add( months => 1, end_of_month => \*(Aqpreserve\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
By default, it uses \*(L"wrap\*(R" for positive durations and \*(L"preserve\*(R" for negative
durations. See DateTime::Duration for a detailed explanation of these
algorithms.
.PP
If you need to do lots of work with durations, take a look at Rick
Measham's \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::Format::Duration\*(C'\fR module, which lets you present
information from durations in many useful ways.
.PP
There are other subtract/delta methods in DateTime.pm to generate
different types of durations. These methods are
\&\f(CW\*(C`subtract_datetime()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`subtract_datetime_absolute()\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`delta_md()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`delta_days()\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`delta_ms()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIDatetime Subtraction\fR
.IX Subsection "Datetime Subtraction"
.PP
Date subtraction is done solely based on the two object's local
datetimes, with one exception to handle \s-1DST\s0 changes. Also, if the two
datetime objects are in different time zones, one of them is converted
to the other's time zone first before subtraction. This is best
explained through examples:
.PP
The first of these probably makes the most sense:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  my $dt1 = DateTime\->new(
\&      year      => 2003,
\&      month     => 5,

\&
\&  # is DST
\&
\&  my $dur = $dt2\->subtract_datetime($dt1);
\&  # 6 months
.Ve
.PP
Nice and simple.
.PP
This one is a little trickier, but still fairly logical:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  my $dt1 = DateTime\->new(
\&      year      => 2003,
\&      month     => 4,
\&      day       => 5,
\&      hour      => 1,

\&
\&  # is DST

\&  );
\&
\&  # not DST
\&
\&  my $dur = $dt2\->subtract_datetime($dt1);
\&
\&  # 2 days and 3 minutes
.Ve
.PP
Which contradicts the result this one gives, even though they both
make sense:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  my $dt1 = DateTime\->new(
\&      year      => 2003,
\&      month     => 4,

\&  );
\&
\&  # not DST
\&
\&  my $dur = $dt2\->subtract_datetime($dt1);
\&
\&  # 1 day and 3 minutes
.Ve
.PP
This last example illustrates the \*(L"\s-1DST\*(R"\s0 exception mentioned earlier.
The exception accounts for the fact 2003\-04\-06 only lasts 23 hours.
.PP
And finally:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  my $dt2 = DateTime\->new(
\&      year      => 2003,
\&      month     => 10,

\&
\&  my $dt1 = $dt2\->clone\->subtract( hours => 1 );
\&
\&  my $dur = $dt2\->subtract_datetime($dt1);
\&  # 60 minutes
.Ve
.PP
This seems obvious until you realize that subtracting 60 minutes from
\&\f(CW$dt2\fR in the above example still leaves the clock time at
\&\*(L"01:00:00\*(R". This time we are accounting for a 25 hour day.
.PP
\fIReversibility\fR
.IX Subsection "Reversibility"
.PP
Date math operations are not always reversible. This is because of
the way that addition operations are ordered. As was discussed
earlier, adding 1 day and 3 minutes in one call to \f(CW\*(C`add()\*(C'\fR is not the
same as first adding 3 minutes and 1 day in two separate calls.
.PP
If we take a duration returned from \f(CW\*(C`subtract_datetime()\*(C'\fR and then
try to add or subtract that duration from one of the datetimes we just
used, we sometimes get interesting results:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  my $dt1 = DateTime\->new(
\&      year      => 2003,
\&      month     => 4,
\&      day       => 5,
\&      hour      => 1,
\&      minute    => 58,
\&      time_zone => "America/Chicago",

\&
\&  my $dt2 = DateTime\->new(

\&
\&  my $dur = $dt2\->subtract_datetime($dt1);
\&  # 1 day and 3 minutes
\&
\&  $dt1\->add_duration($dur);
\&  # gives us $dt2
\&
\&  $dt2\->subtract_duration($dur);
\&  # gives us 2003\-04\-05 02:58:00 \- 1 hour later than $dt1
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`subtract_duration()\*(C'\fR operation gives us a (perhaps) unexpected
answer because it first subtracts one day to get 2003\-04\-05T03:01:00
and then subtracts 3 minutes to get the final result.
.PP
If we explicitly reverse the order we can get the original value of
\&\f(CW$dt1\fR. This can be facilitated by \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::Duration\*(C'\fR's

If we do the following:

Leap seconds also force us to distinguish between minutes and seconds
during date math. Given the following datetime:
.PP

we will get different results when adding 1 minute than we get if we

However, this works:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->new(
\&      year      => 2003,
\&      month     => 4,
\&      day       => 5,
\&      hour      => 2,
\&      time_zone => \*(AqAmerica/Chicago\*(Aq,
\&  );
\&
\&  $dt\->add( hours => 24 );
.Ve
.PP
and produces a datetime with the local time of \*(L"03:00\*(R".
.PP
If all this makes your head hurt, there is a simple alternative. Just
convert your datetime object to the \*(L"\s-1UTC\*(R"\s0 time zone before doing date
math on it, and switch it back to the local time zone afterwards.
This avoids the possibility of having date math throw an exception,
and makes sure that 1 day equals 24 hours. Of course, this may not
always be desirable, so caveat user!
.SS "Overloading"
.IX Subsection "Overloading"
This module explicitly overloads the addition (+), subtraction (\-),
string and numeric comparison operators. This means that the
following all do sensible things:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $new_dt = $dt + $duration_obj;
\&
\&  my $new_dt = $dt \- $duration_obj;
\&
\&  my $duration_obj = $dt \- $new_dt;
\&
\&  foreach my $dt ( sort @dts ) { ... }
.Ve
.PP
Additionally, the fallback parameter is set to true, so other
derivable operators (+=, \-=, etc.) will work properly. Do not expect
increment (++) or decrement (\-\-) to do anything useful.
.PP
The string comparison operators, \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`ne\*(C'\fR, will use the string
value to compare with non-DateTime objects.
.PP
DateTime objects do not have a numeric value, using \f(CW\*(C`==\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`<=>\*(C'\fR to compare a DateTime object with a non-DateTime object will result
in an exception. To safely sort mixed DateTime and non-DateTime
objects, use \f(CW\*(C`sort { $a cmp $b } @dates\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The module also overloads stringification using the object's
formatter, defaulting to \f(CW\*(C`iso8601()\*(C'\fR method. See \*(L"Formatters And
Stringification\*(R" for details.
.SS "Formatters And Stringification"
.IX Subsection "Formatters And Stringification"
You can optionally specify a \*(L"formatter\*(R", which is usually a
DateTime::Format::* object/class, to control the stringification of
the DateTime object.
.PP
Any of the constructor methods can accept a formatter argument:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $formatter = DateTime::Format::Strptime\->new(...);
\&  my $dt = DateTime\->new(year => 2004, formatter => $formatter);
.Ve
.PP
Or, you can set it afterwards:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $dt\->set_formatter($formatter);
\&  $formatter = $dt\->formatter();
.Ve
.PP
Once you set the formatter, the overloaded stringification method will
use the formatter. If unspecified, the \f(CW\*(C`iso8601()\*(C'\fR method is used.
.PP
A formatter can be handy when you know that in your application you
want to stringify your DateTime objects into a special format all the
time, for example to a different language.
.PP
If you provide a formatter class name or object, it must implement a
\&\f(CW\*(C`format_datetime\*(C'\fR method. This method will be called with just the
DateTime object as its argument.
.SS "\s-1CLDR\s0 Patterns"
.IX Subsection "CLDR Patterns"
The \s-1CLDR\s0 pattern language is both more powerful and more complex than
strftime. Unlike strftime patterns, you often have to explicitly
escape text that you do not want formatted, as the patterns are simply
letters without any prefix.
.PP
For example, \*(L"yyyy-MM-dd\*(R" is a valid \s-1CLDR\s0 pattern. If you want to
include any lower or upper case \s-1ASCII\s0 characters as-is, you can
surround them with single quotes ('). If you want to include a single
quote, you must escape it as two single quotes ('').
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  \*(AqToday is \*(Aq EEEE
\&  \*(AqIt is now\*(Aq h \*(Aqo\*(Aq\*(Aqclock\*(Aq a
.Ve
.PP
Spaces and any non-letter text will always be passed through as-is.
.PP
Many \s-1CLDR\s0 patterns which produce numbers will pad the number with
leading zeroes depending on the length of the format specifier. For
example, \*(L"h\*(R" represents the current hour from 1\-12. If you specify
\&\*(L"hh\*(R" then the 1\-9 will have a leading zero prepended.
.PP
However, \s-1CLDR\s0 often uses five of a letter to represent the narrow form
of a pattern. This inconsistency is necessary for backwards
compatibility.
.PP
\&\s-1CLDR\s0 often distinguishes between the \*(L"format\*(R" and \*(L"stand-alone\*(R" forms
of a pattern. The format pattern is used when the thing in question is
being placed into a larger string. The stand-alone form is used when
displaying that item by itself, for example in a calendar.
.PP
It also often provides three sizes for each item, wide (the full
name), abbreviated, and narrow. The narrow form is often just a single
character, for example \*(L"T\*(R" for \*(L"Tuesday\*(R", and may not be unique.
.PP
\&\s-1CLDR\s0 provides a fairly complex system for localizing time zones that
we ignore entirely. The time zone patterns just use the information
provided by \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\*(C'\fR, and \fIdo not follow the \s-1CLDR\s0 spec\fR.
.PP
The output of a \s-1CLDR\s0 pattern is always localized, when applicable.
.PP
\&\s-1CLDR\s0 provides the following patterns:
.IP "\(bu" 4

yy
.Sp

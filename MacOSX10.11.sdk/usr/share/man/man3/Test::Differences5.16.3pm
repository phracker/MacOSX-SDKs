When the code you're testing returns multiple lines, records or data
structures and they're just plain wrong, an equivalent to the Unix
\&\f(CW\*(C`diff\*(C'\fR utility may be just what's needed.  Here's output from an
example test script that checks two text documents and then two
(trivial) data structures:

.PP
eq_or_diff_...() compares two strings or (limited) data structures and
either emits an ok indication or a side-by-side diff.  Test::Differences
is designed to be used with Test.pm and with Test::Simple, Test::More,
and other Test::Builder based testing modules.  As the \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0 shows,
another testing module must be used as the basis for your test suite.
.PP
These functions assume that you are presenting it with \*(L"flat\*(R" records,
looking like:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   \- scalars composed of record\-per\-line
\&   \- arrays of scalars,
\&   \- arrays of arrays of scalars,
\&   \- arrays of hashes containing only scalars
.Ve
.PP
All of these are flattened in to single strings which are then compared
for differences.  Differently data structures can be compared, as long
as they flatten identically.
.PP
All other data structures are run through Data::Dumper first.  This is a
bit dangerous, as some versions of perl shipped with Data::Dumpers that
could do the oddest things with unexpected, like core dump.  Only as of
5.8.0 does Data::Dumper sort hash keys, which is necessary for \s-1HASH\s0
dumps to be fully predictable.  This will be changed when this bites
somebody or I get some free time.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`eq_or_diff()\*(C'\fR starts counting records at 0 unless you pass it two text
strings:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   eq_or_diff $a, $b;   ## First line is line number 1
\&   eq_or_diff @a, @b;   ## First element is element 0
\&   eq_or_diff $a, @b;   ## First line/element is element 0
.Ve
.PP
If you want to force a first record number of 0, use \f(CW\*(C`eq_or_diff_data\*(C'\fR.  If
you want to force a first record number of 1, use \f(CW\*(C`eq_or_diff_text\*(C'\fR.  I chose
this over passing in an options hash because it's clearer and simpler this way.
\&\s-1YMMV\s0.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The options to \f(CW\*(C`eq_or_diff\*(C'\fR give some fine-grained control over the output.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`context\*(C'\fR
.Sp
This allows you to control the amount of context shown:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   eq_or_diff $got, $expected, $name, { context => 50000 };
.Ve
.Sp
will show you lots and lots of context.  Normally, \fIeq_or_diff()\fR uses
some heuristics to determine whether to show 3 lines of context (like
a normal unified diff) or 25 lines.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`data_type\*(C'\fR
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`text\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`data\*(C'\fR. See \f(CW\*(C`eq_or_diff_text\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eq_or_diff_data\*(C'\fR to
understand this. You can usually ignore this.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`Sortkeys\*(C'\fR
.Sp
If passed, whatever value is added is used as the argument for Data::Dumper
Sortkeys option. See the Data::Dumper docs to understand how you can
control the Sortkeys behavior.
.SH "DIFF STYLES"
.IX Header "DIFF STYLES"
For extremely long strings, a table diff can wrap on your screen and be hard
to read.  If you are comfortable with different diff formats, you can switch
to a format more suitable for your data.  These are the four formats supported
by the Text::Diff module and are set with the following functions:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`table_diff\*(C'\fR (the default)
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`unified_diff\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`oldstyle_diff\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`context_diff\*(C'\fR
.PP
You can run the following to understand the different diff output styles:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& use Test::More \*(Aqno_plan\*(Aq;
\& use Test::Differences;
\&
\& my $long_string = join \*(Aq\*(Aq => 1..40;
\&
\& TODO: {
\&     local $TODO = \*(AqTesting diff styles\*(Aq;
\&
\&     # this is the default and does not need to explicitly set unless you need
\&     # to reset it back from another diff type
\&     table_diff;
\&     eq_or_diff $long_string, "\-$long_string", \*(Aqtable diff\*(Aq;
\&
\&     unified_diff;
\&     eq_or_diff $long_string, "\-$long_string", \*(Aqunified diff\*(Aq;
\&
\&     context_diff;
\&     eq_or_diff $long_string, "\-$long_string", \*(Aqcontext diff\*(Aq;
\&
\&     oldstyle_diff;
\&     eq_or_diff $long_string, "\-$long_string", \*(Aqoldstyle diff\*(Aq;
\& }
.Ve
.SH "DEPLOYING"
.IX Header "DEPLOYING"
There are several basic ways of deploying Test::Differences requiring more or less
labor by you or your users.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fallback to \f(CW\*(C`is_deeply\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This is your best option if you want this module to be optional.
.Sp
.Vb 6
\& use Test::More;
\& BEGIN {
\&     if (!eval q{ use Test::Differences; 1 }) {
\&         *eq_or_diff = \e&is_deeply;
\&     }
\& }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4

.Sp
.Vb 1
\& eval "use Test::Differences";
.Ve
.Sp
If you want to detect the presence of Test::Differences on the fly, something
like the following code might do the trick for you:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use Test qw( !ok );   ## get all syms *except* ok
\&
\&    eval "use Test::Differences";
\&    use Data::Dumper;
\&
\&    sub ok {
\&        goto &eq_or_diff if defined &eq_or_diff && @_ > 1;
\&        @_ = map ref $_ ? Dumper( @_ ) : $_, @_;
\&        goto Test::&ok;
\&    }
\&
\&    plan tests => 1;
\&
\&    ok "a", "b";
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1PREREQ_PM\s0 => { .... \*(L"Test::Differences\*(R" => 0, ... }
.Sp
This method will let \s-1CPAN\s0 and \s-1CPANPLUS\s0 users download it automatically.  It
will discomfit those users who choose/have to download all packages manually.
.IP "\(bu" 4
t/lib/Test/Differences.pm, t/lib/Text/Diff.pm, ...
.Sp
By placing Test::Differences and its prerequisites in the t/lib directory, you
avoid forcing your users to download the Test::Differences manually if they
aren't using \s-1CPAN\s0 or \s-1CPANPLUS\s0.
.Sp
If you put a \f(CW\*(C`use lib "t/lib";\*(C'\fR in the top of each test suite before the
\&\f(CW\*(C`use Test::Differences;\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR should work well.
.Sp
You might want to check once in a while for new Test::Differences releases
if you do this.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.IX Header "LIMITATIONS"
.ie n .SS """Test"" or ""Test::More"""
.el .SS "\f(CWTest\fP or \f(CWTest::More\fP"
.IX Subsection "Test or Test::More"
This module \*(L"mixes in\*(R" with Test.pm or any of the test libraries based on
Test::Builder (Test::Simple, Test::More, etc).  It does this by peeking to see
whether Test.pm or Test/Builder.pm is in \f(CW%INC\fR, so if you are not using one of
those, it will print a warning and play dumb by not emitting test numbers (or
incrementing them).  If you are using one of these, it should interoperate
nicely.
.SS "Exporting"
.IX Subsection "Exporting"
Exports all 3 functions by default (and by design).  Use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Test::Differences ();
.Ve
.PP
to suppress this behavior if you don't like the namespace pollution.
.PP
This module will not override functions like \fIok()\fR, \fIis()\fR, \fIis_deeply()\fR, etc.  If
it did, then you could \f(CW\*(C`eval "use Test::Differences qw( is_deeply );"\*(C'\fR to get
automatic upgrading to diffing behaviors without the \f(CW\*(C`sub my_ok\*(C'\fR shown above.
Test::Differences intentionally does not provide this behavior because this
would mean that Test::Differences would need to emulate every popular test
module out there, which would require far more coding and maintenance that I'm
willing to do.  Use the eval and my_ok deployment shown above if you want some
level of automation.
.SS "Unicode"
.IX Subsection "Unicode"
Perls before 5.6.0 don't support characters > 255 at all, and 5.6.0
seems broken.  This means that you might get odd results using perl5.6.0
with unicode strings.
.ie n .SS """Data::Dumper"" and older Perls."
.el .SS "\f(CWData::Dumper\fP and older Perls."
.IX Subsection "Data::Dumper and older Perls."
Relies on Data::Dumper (for now), which, prior to perl5.8, will not always
report hashes in the same order.  \f(CW $Data::Dumper::SortKeys \fR \fIis\fR set to 1,
so on more recent versions of Data::Dumper, this should not occur.  Check \s-1CPAN\s0
to see if it's been peeled out of the main perl distribution and backported.
Reported by Ilya Martynov <ilya@martynov.org>, although the SortKeys \*(L"future
perfect\*(R" workaround has been set in anticipation of a new Data::Dumper for a
while.  Note that the two hashes should report the same here:

Data::Dumper also overlooks the difference between
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $a[0] = \e$a[1];
\&    $a[1] = \e$a[0];   # $a[0] = \e$a[1]

.Vb 3
\&    $x = \e$y;
\&    $y = \e$x;
\&    @a = ( $x, $y );  # $a[0] = \e$y, not \e$a[1]
.Ve
.PP
The former involves two scalars, the latter 4: \f(CW$x\fR, \f(CW$y\fR, and \f(CW@a\fR[0,1].
This was carefully explained to me in words of two syllables or less by
Yves Orton <demerphq@hotmail.com>.  The plan to address this is to allow
you to select Data::Denter or some other module of your choice as an
option.

.SH "NAME"
AutoSplit \- split a package for autoloading
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& autosplit($file, $dir, $keep, $check, $modtime);
\&
\& autosplit_lib_modules(@modules);
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This function will split up your program into files that the AutoLoader
module can handle. It is used by both the standard perl libraries and by
the MakeMaker utility, to automatically configure libraries for autoloading.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`autosplit\*(C'\fR interface splits the specified file into a hierarchy 
rooted at the directory \f(CW$dir\fR. It creates directories as needed to reflect
class hierarchy, and creates the file \fIautosplit.ix\fR. This file acts as
both forward declaration of all package routines, and as timestamp for the
last update of the hierarchy.
.PP
The remaining three arguments to \f(CW\*(C`autosplit\*(C'\fR govern other options to
the autosplitter.
.ie n .IP "$keep" 2
.el .IP "\f(CW$keep\fR" 2
.IX Item "$keep"
If the third argument, \fI\f(CI$keep\fI\fR, is false, then any
pre-existing \f(CW\*(C`*.al\*(C'\fR files in the autoload directory are removed if
they are no longer part of the module (obsoleted functions).
\&\f(CW$keep\fR defaults to 0.
.ie n .IP "$check" 2
.el .IP "\f(CW$check\fR" 2
.IX Item "$check"
The
fourth argument, \fI\f(CI$check\fI\fR, instructs \f(CW\*(C`autosplit\*(C'\fR to check the module
currently being split to ensure that it includes a \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR
specification for the AutoLoader module, and skips the module if
AutoLoader is not detected.
\&\f(CW$check\fR defaults to 1.
.ie n .IP "$modtime" 2
.el .IP "\f(CW$modtime\fR" 2
.IX Item "$modtime"
Lastly, the \fI\f(CI$modtime\fI\fR argument specifies
that \f(CW\*(C`autosplit\*(C'\fR is to check the modification time of the module
against that of the \f(CW\*(C`autosplit.ix\*(C'\fR file, and only split the module if
it is newer.
\&\f(CW$modtime\fR defaults to 1.
.PP
Typical use of AutoSplit in the perl MakeMaker utility is via the command-line
with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& perl \-e \*(Aquse AutoSplit; autosplit($ARGV[0], $ARGV[1], 0, 1, 1)\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Defined as a Make macro, it is invoked with file and directory arguments;
\&\f(CW\*(C`autosplit\*(C'\fR will split the specified file into the specified directory and
delete obsolete \f(CW\*(C`.al\*(C'\fR files, after checking first that the module does use
the AutoLoader, and ensuring that the module is not already currently split
in its current form (the modtime test).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`autosplit_lib_modules\*(C'\fR form is used in the building of perl. It takes
as input a list of files (modules) that are assumed to reside in a directory
\&\fBlib\fR relative to the current directory. Each file is sent to the 
autosplitter one at a time, to be split into the directory \fBlib/auto\fR.
.PP
In both usages of the autosplitter, only subroutines defined following the
perl \fI_\|_END_\|_\fR token are split out into separate files. Some
routines may be placed prior to this marker to force their immediate loading
and parsing.
.SS "Multiple packages"
.IX Subsection "Multiple packages"
As of version 1.01 of the AutoSplit module it is possible to have
multiple packages within a single file. Both of the following cases
are supported:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&   package NAME;
\&   _\|_END_\|_
\&   sub AAA { ... }
\&   package NAME::option1;
\&   sub BBB { ... }
\&   package NAME::option2;
\&   sub BBB { ... }
\&
\&   package NAME;
\&   _\|_END_\|_
\&   sub AAA { ... }
\&   sub NAME::option1::BBB { ... }
\&   sub NAME::option2::BBB { ... }
.Ve
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoSplit\*(C'\fR will inform the user if it is necessary to create the
top-level directory specified in the invocation. It is preferred that
the script or installation process that invokes \f(CW\*(C`AutoSplit\*(C'\fR have
created the full directory path ahead of time. This warning may
indicate that the module is being split into an incorrect path.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoSplit\*(C'\fR will warn the user of all subroutines whose name causes
potential file naming conflicts on machines with drastically limited
(8 characters or less) file name length. Since the subroutine name is
used as the file name, these warnings can aid in portability to such
systems.
.PP
Warnings are issued and the file skipped if \f(CW\*(C`AutoSplit\*(C'\fR cannot locate
either the \fI_\|_END_\|_\fR marker or a \*(L"package Name;\*(R"\-style specification.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoSplit\*(C'\fR will also emit general diagnostics for inability to
create directories or files.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.IX Header "AUTHOR"
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoSplit\*(C'\fR is maintained by the perl5\-porters. Please direct
any questions to the canonical mailing list. Anything that
is applicable to the \s-1CPAN\s0 release can be sent to its maintainer,
though.

.SH "COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE"

This package has been part of the perl core since the first release
of perl5. It has been released separately to \s-1CPAN\s0 so older installations
can benefit from bug fixes.

\&    fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file

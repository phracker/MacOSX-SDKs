Use this when the moving or creation of an item will replace any item that gets in its way. To avoid a race condition use it regardless of whether there is actually an item in the way before the writing begins. Don't use this when simply updating the contents of a file, even if the way you do that is writing the contents to another file and renaming it into place. This is not a valid option to use with -prepareForReadingItemsAtURLs:options:writingItemsAtURLs:options:error:byAccessor:.

If your application reads an item and then registers a file presenter for it there is a possible race condition in which between those two steps another process does coordinated reading or writing of the item, without any messages sent to your not-quite-registered file presenter. This can leave your file presenter ignorant of the fact that what it knows about the item it just read is already out of date, or under the misconception that just because it hasn't received a -relinquish... method it owns the item. To avoid that race condition you can invoke +addFilePresenter: in the same block that you pass to -coordinateReadingItemAtURL:options:error:byAccessor: to read what the file presenter will present.

/* The designated initializer. If an NSFilePresenter is provided then the receiver is considered to have been created by that NSFilePresenter, or on its behalf.

NSFileCoordinator is meant to be instantiated on a per-file-operation basis, where a file operation is something like the opening or saving of a document, or the copying or moving of a batch of folders and files. There is no benefit to keeping an instance of it alive in your application for much more time than it takes to actually perform the file operation. Doing so can be harmful, or at least wasteful of memory, because NSFileCoordinators may retain NSFilePresenters.

You pass an NSFilePresenter to this initializer when the operation whose file access is to be coordinated is being performed by that NSFilePresenter. Associating an NSFileCoordinator with an NSFilePresenter accomplishes a few important things:
- It prevents the NSFileCoordinator from sending messages to that NSFilePresenter, so the NSFilePresenter does not have to somehow filter out messages about its own file operations. The exception to this rule is that messages about versions of the presented item being added, remove, or resolved during coordinated writing are sent to every relevant NSFilePresenter, even the one passed to -initWithFilePresenter:.
- It allows the file coordination mechanism to determine when coordinated writing is being done in response to an NSFilePresenter receiving a -savePresentedItemChangesWithCompletionHandler: message, and not deadlock. Usually coordinated writing done by one NSFileCoordinator must wait for coordinated reading of the same file or directory done by another NSFileCoordinator. But, for example, when coordinated reading is begun with one NSFileCoordinator, and that causes an NSFilePresenter to do coordinated writing using another NSFileCoordinator, the writing done with the second NSFileCoordinator should not wait for the completion of the first NSFileCoordinator's reading, it should instead happen while the first NSFileCoordinator is waiting to read.
- It allows the file coordination mechanism to handle a race condition that can occur when it has sent an NSFilePresenter a -presentedItemDidMoveToURL: message in the NSFilePresenter's operation queue but before that message is dequeued the NSFilePresenter enqueues, on a different queue, an operation using the old URL. For this to be effective however the NSFileCoordinator must be initialized in the same operation queue in which NSFilePresenter messages are received.
- It allows the file coordination mechanism to gracefully handle your application's registration of an NSFilePresenter that at first returns nil when sent -presentedItemURL but can later return non-nil at the end of doing a coordinated write that creates the presented item in the file system for the very first time. AppKit for example takes advantage of this by registering brand new untitled NSDocuments as NSFilePresenters immediately, instead of waiting until after the first time the user causes the document to be saved to a file, which would be more complicated.

For example, NSDocument creates a single NSFileCoordinator for all of the coordinated reading and writing it does during the saving of a document. It always creates the NSFileCoordinator in the main queue even when it is doing the actual coordinated reading and writing in a background queue to implement asynchronous saving.

#pragma mark *** Purpose Identifier ***

/* A string that uniquely identifies the file access that will be done by this NSFileCoordinator. Every NSFileCoordinator has a unique purpose identifier that is created during initialization. Coordinated reads and writes performed by NSFileCoordinators with the same purpose identifier never block each other, even if they exist in different processes. In addition to some of the reasons explained in the comments of -initWithFilePresenter:, you may want to set a custom purpose identifier for the following reasons:
- Your application has an NSFileProviderExtension. Any file coordination done on behalf of the NSFileProviderExtension needs to be done using the same purpose identifier reported by your NSFileProviderExtension.
- To avoid deadlocking when two separate subsystems need to work together to perform one high-level operation, and both subsystems perform their own coordinated reads or writes.
 
If you are coordinating file access on behalf of an NSFilePresenter, you should use -initWithFilePresenter: and should not attempt to set a custom purpose identifier. Every NSFileCoordinator instance initialized with the same NSFilePresenter will have the same purpose identifier.
 
When creating custom purpose identifiers, you can use a reverse DNS style string, such as "com.mycompany.myapplication.mypurpose", or a UUID string. Nil and zero-length strings are not allowed.
 
Purpose identifiers can be set only once. If you attempt to set the purpose identifier of an NSFileCoordinator that you initialized with -initWithFilePresenter: or that you already assigned a purpose identifier, an exception will be thrown.

#pragma mark *** Asynchronous File Coordination ***

/* You can consider "item" in method names and comments in this header file to be an abbreviation of "fileOrDirectory." As always, a directory might actually be a file package.

The term "reader" refers to an invocation of -coordinateAccessWithIntents:queue:byAccessor: with at least one NSFileAccessIntent created with +readingIntentWithURL:options:. Similarly, the term "writer" refers to an invocation of -coordinateAccessWithIntents:queue:byAccessor: with at least one NSFileAccessIntent created with +writingIntentWithURL:optiosn:.
*/

/* Given an array of one or more NSFileAccessIntent objects that specify reading and/or writing items located by the corresponding URLs, wait asynchronously for certain other readers and writers and then invoke the passed-in block on the given queue, which must not be nil. If an error occurs, file access is not granted and a non-nil error will be passed to the accessor block. If file access is successfully granted, then 'error' will be nil and you may perform the intended file access inside the accessor block.
 
You must use the URL property on the NSFileAccessIntent objects when performing file access in the accessor block. Within the block, the NSFileAccessIntent objects' URLs may differ from their original values to account for items that have been moved or renamed while waiting for access to be granted. When access to the intended files is granted, certain other readers and writers are made to wait until the given block returns, which defines the end of that file access. Do not allow file access to continue after the accessor block returns by dispatching work to other threads or queues.
 
You can invoke this method to serialize your process's access of files and directories with other processes' access of the same files and directories so that inconsistencies due to overlapping reading and writing don't occur. It also causes messages to be sent to NSFilePresenters, and wait for NSFilePresenters to react, as described below. The fact that file system items can be moved or renamed while this method is waiting to invoke the block you passed when invoking it is why it's critical to use the URL property on the NSFileAccessIntent objects, not the URLs you used when initializing them.
 
In general a coordinated reader waits for a coordinated writer of the same item, and a coordinated writer waits for coordinated readers and other coordinated writers of the same item. Coordinated readers do not wait for each other. Coordinated reading or writing of items in a file package is treated as coordinated reading or writing of the file package as a whole. A coordinated reader of a directory that is not a file package does not wait for coordinated writers of contained items, or cause such writers to wait. With one exception, a coordinated writer of a directory that is not a file package does not wait for coordinated readers and writers of contained items, or cause such readers and writers to wait. The exception is when you use NSFileCoordinatorWritingForDeleting, NSFileCoordinatorWritingForMoving, or NSFileCoordinatorWritingForReplacing. They make your coordinated writer wait for previously scheduled coordinated readers and writers of contained items, and causes subsequently scheduled coordinated readers and writers of contained items to wait.
 
None of those rules apply to coordinated readers and writers that are using the exact same instance of NSFileCoordinator, including arrays of multiple NSFileAccessIntent objects. Instances of NSFileCoordinator never block themselves. You can take advantage of that in a couple of ways when invoking -coordinateAccessWithIntents:queue:byAccessor: multiple times on the same NSFileCoordinator instance, but take care because doing so raises the possibility of deadlocking with other processes that are doing the same sort of thing. If you can, you should invoke -coordinateAccessWithIntents:queue:byAccessor: a single time with multiple NSFileAccessIntent objects instead of invoking it multiple times with a single NSFileAccssIntent object.
 
In addition to waiting for writers, readers wait for NSFilePresenters that are messaged as part of the coordinated reading.
 
Coordinated reading of an item triggers the sending of messages to NSFilePresenters that implement the corresponding optional methods, even those in other processes, except the one specified when -initWithFilePresenter: was invoked:
- -relinquishPresentedItemToReader: is sent to NSFilePresenters of the item and, if the item is in a file package, NSFilePresenters of the file package. If there are nested file packages then the message is sent to NSFilePresenters of all of them.
- If NSFileCoordinatorReadingWithoutChanges is not used then -savePresentedItemChangesWithCompletionHandler: is also sent to the same NSFilePresenters.

In addition to waiting for readers and other writers, writers wait for NSFilePresenters that are messaged as part of the coordinated writing.
 
Coordinated writing of an item triggers the sending of messages to NSFilePresenters that implement the corresponding optional methods, even those in other processes, except the one specified when -initWithFilePresenter: was invoked:
- -relinquishPresentedItemToWriter: is sent to NSFilePresenters of the item and, if the item is in a file package, NSFilePresenters of the file package. If there are nested file packages then the message is sent to NSFilePresenters of all of them.
- If NSFileCoordinatorWritingForDeleting, NSFileCoordinatorWritingForMoving, or NSFileCoordinatorWritingForReplacing is used and the item is a directory then -relinquishPresentedItemToWriter: is also sent to NSFilePresenters of each item contained by it.
- If NSFileCoordinatorWritingForDeleting or NSFileCoordinatorWritingForReplacing is used then -accommodatePresentedItemDeletionWithCompletionHandler: is sent to NSFilePresenters of the item and, if the item is a directory, NSFilePresenters of each item contained by it. -accommodatePresentedSubitemDeletionAtURL:completionHandler: is sent to NSFilePresenters of each file package that contains the item.
- When NSFileCoordinatorWritingForReplacing is used the the definition of "the item" depends on what happened while waiting for other writers. See the description of it above.
- If NSFileCoordinatorWritingForMerging is used then -savePresentedItemChangesWithCompletionHandler: is sent to NSFilePresenters of the item and, if the item is in a file package, NSFilePresenters of the file package. If there are nested file packages then the message is sent to NSFilePresenters of all of them.
 
For both coordinated reading and writing, if there are multiple NSFilePresenters involved then the order in which they are messaged is undefined. If an NSFilePresenter signals failure then waiting will fail and *outError will be set to an NSError describing the failure.

#pragma mark *** Synchronous File Coordination ***

/* The next four methods behave similarly to -coordinateAccessWithIntents:queue:byAccessor: with one or two NSFileAccessIntent objects with the following exceptions:

Each of these methods wait synchronously on the same thread they were invoked on before invoking the passed-in accessor block on the same thread, instead of waiting asynchronously and scheduling invocation of the block on a specific queue.

The accessor block of each of these methods is passed one or more URLs that locate the intended items, perhaps changed from the original URLs to take into account the fact that the item might have been moved or renamed during the waiting.
 
Each of these methods returns an NSError by reference instead of passing it to the accessory block. However, these methods are uncommon among Cocoa framework methods in that they don't also return a result indicating success or failure. The success of the waiting that they do is typically not interesting to invokers. Only the success of file system access done by the passed-in block is interesting. (The failure of either is of course interesting.) When invoking these methods it's cleanest to just declare a __block variable outside of the block and initialize it to a value that signals failure, and then inside the block set it to a value that signals success. If the waiting fails then the invoked method sets the error reference to an NSError that describes what went wrong, your block will not be invoked, your __block variable will not be set to a value that signals success, and all will be as it should be, with failure signaled and an NSError that describes the failure.

#pragma mark *** Batched File Coordination ***

/* Prepare to more efficiently do a large number of invocations of -coordinate... methods, first synchronously messaging and waiting for NSFilePresenters in a variation of what individual invocations of the -coordinate... methods would do, and then, if no error occurs, invoke the passed-in block. The passed-in block must invoke the completion handler passed to it when all of the coordinated reading and writing it does is done. The completion handler block can be invoked on any thread (or from any dispatch queue, if that's how you think of it). This method returns errors in the same manner as the -coordinate... methods.

The -coordinate... methods must use interprocess communication to message instances of NSFileCoordinator and NSFilePresenter in other processes in the system. That is an expense best avoided when reading or writing many files in one operation. Using this method can greatly reduce the amount of interprocess communication required by, for example, a large batched copying or moving of files. You use it by moving all of the invocations of the -coordinate... methods your application will do during a batch operation, or the scheduling of them if the operation's work is done in a multithreaded fashion, into a block and passing that block to an invocation of this method, remembering that the completion handler passed to that block must be invoked when the operation is done. You don't simply pass all URLs that will be passed into invocations of the -coordinate... methods when invoking this method. Instead you pass the top-level files and directories involved in the operation. This method triggers messages to not just NSFilePresenters of those items, but also NSFilePresenters of items contained by those items. For example, when Finder uses this method during a copy operation readingURLs is an array of the URLs of the exact files and folders that the user has selected, even though those folders may contain many files and subfolders for which Finder is going to do coordinated reading, and writingURLs is an array that contains just the URL of the destination folder.

In most cases it is redundant to pass the same reading or writing options in an invocation of this method as are passed to individual invocations of the -coordinate... methods invoked by the block passed to an invocation of this method. For example, when Finder invokes this method during a copy operation it does not pass NSFileCoordinatorReadingWithoutChanges because it is appropriate to trigger the saving of document changes right away, but it does pass it when doing the nested invocations of -coordinate... methods because it is not necessary to trigger saving again, even if the user changes the document before the Finder proceeds far enough to actually copy that document's file.

A sandboxed application like TextEdit must ordinarily prompt the user for approval before renaming a document. You can invoke this method to make your process declare its intent to rename a document without user approval. After the renaming succeeds you must invoke -itemAtURL:didMoveToURL:, with the same arguments, for the process to keep access to the file with its new name and to give up access to any file that appears with the old name.

Messages that have already been sent to NSFilePresenters will not be cancelled but the file coordination machinery will stop waiting for the replies.

This method can be invoked from any thread. It always returns immediately, without waiting for anything.

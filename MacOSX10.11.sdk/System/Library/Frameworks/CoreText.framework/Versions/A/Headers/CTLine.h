    @discussion Passing 0 (no options) returns the typographic bounds,
                including typographic leading and shifts.

    @constant   kCTLineBoundsExcludeTypographicLeading
                Pass this option to exclude typographic leading.

    @constant   kCTLineBoundsExcludeTypographicShifts
                Pass this option to ignore cross-stream shifts due to
                positioning (such as kerning or baseline alignment).

    @constant   kCTLineBoundsUseHangingPunctuation
                Normally line bounds include all glyphs; pass this option to
                treat standard punctuation hanging off either end of the line
                as fully hanging.

    @constant   kCTLineBoundsUseGlyphPathBounds
                Pass this option to use glyph path bounds rather than the
                default typographic bounds.

    @constant   kCTLineBoundsUseOpticalBounds
                Pass this option to use optical bounds. This option overrides
                kCTLineBoundsUseGlyphPathBounds.

                Pass this option to include additional space based on common
                glyph sequences for various languages. The result is intended
                to be used when drawing to avoid clipping that may be caused

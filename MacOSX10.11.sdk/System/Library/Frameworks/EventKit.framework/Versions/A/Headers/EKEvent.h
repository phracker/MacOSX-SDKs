    @property   eventIdentifier
    @abstract   A unique identifier for this event.
    @discussion This identifier can be used to look the event up using [EKEventStore eventWithIdentifier:].
                You can use this not only to simply fetch the event, but also to validate the event
                has not been deleted out from under you when you get an external change notification
                via the EKEventStore database changed notification. If eventWithIdentifier: returns nil,
                the event was deleted.

                Please note that if you change the calendar of an event, this ID will likely change. It is
                currently also possible for the ID to change due to a sync operation. For example, if
                a user moved an event on a different client to another calendar, we'd see it as a 
                completely new event here.

     @method     refresh
     @abstract   Refreshes an event object to ensure it's still valid.
     @discussion When the database changes, your application is sent an EKEventStoreChangedNotification
                 note. You should generally consider all EKEvent instances to be invalid as soon as
                 you receive the notification. However, for events you truly care to keep around, you
                 can call this method. It ensures the record is still valid by ensuring the event and
                 start date are still valid. It also attempts to refresh all properties except those
                 you might have modified. If this method returns NO, the record has been deleted or is
                 otherwise invalid. You should not continue to use it. If it returns YES, all is still
                 well, and the record is ready for continued use. You should only call this method on
                 events that are more critical to keep around if possible, such as an event that is
                 being actively edited, as this call is fairly heavyweight. Do not use it to refresh
                 the entire selected range of events you might have had selected. It is mostly pointless
                 anyway, as recurrence information may have changed.
